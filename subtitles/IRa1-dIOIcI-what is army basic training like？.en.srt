1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
so at this point I hadn't even seen a

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,279
machine gun with my own eyes let alone

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,960
heard one so I hear the machine guns

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,360
going off and I see the Tracer fire

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,820
arching over my head and I feel my heart

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,040
just drop it's the craziest experience

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,560
so this was Army basic training so they

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,900
had heard this all the trainees into the

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
this huge goalie I didn't even know what

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,320
it was at the time but now looking back

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,580
it was actually a trench the same way a

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,460
trench would be in like World War one

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,080
and on the other side of the field there

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,519
was two machine gun turrets well

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,140
actually got two there's probably many

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,180
machine gun turrets they had this

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,460
machine gun called The M249 I believe no

18
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,860
no these were m240s they had the full

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,899
m240 so the way it works is the machine

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,700
gun fires five rounds and then it Trace

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
around then five rounds and then a trace

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,739
around so that the machine gunner knows

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,260
where the rounds are landing so we could

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,079
see these Tracer rounds all over us and

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,000
then we hear our drill sergeants whistle

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,500
with this this long metal whistle the

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
same kind which they would have used in

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,520
like World War one this is a training

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,840
exercise it was called Nick at night is

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
what we called it it's night

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
infiltration course and I see so it's

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,560
night infiltration course at night kind

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,780
of redundant but redundancy is what the

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,119
Army is about not gonna lie so there we

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,400
were we were we were crawling a low

36
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,560
crawl it's the most uncomfortable way

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,020
you could possibly get across a piece of

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,420
ground you're literally face first on

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,220
the ground completely flat not even your

40
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,080
legs can come up you have to just crawl

41
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,479
and you have your weapon you have your

42
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,479
helmet you have body armor you have

43
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,700
freaking your canteens you have all this

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,159
kit on you and you're just trying to get

45
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,439
forward and so much effort for even

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,240
moving a few inches and they had made it

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,400
like it was a beach they had made it

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
like Sandy and and Gravelly so it was

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,000
terrible like we were we were ripping

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,220
skin off our

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,079
um elbows and shins as we try to get

52
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,939
through this patch of land so this was a

53
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,579
simulation exercise they wanted to show

54
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,040
us what it would have felt like to be a

55
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,899
soldier in World War one being told to

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,939
rush the other side the sergeant

57
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,340
whistles and they're gonna get out

58
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,439
trenches we have to start going so this

59
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,600
was one of the most memorable

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,920
experiences I have from Army basic

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,660
training in this video I'm going to

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,780
share some of those experiences and also

63
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,400
make something called a mango lassi one

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,780
of my favorite drinks of all time and

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
this is actually going to be the best

66
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,520
mango lassi video on YouTube and this is

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,500
a new Cooking Channel so you're welcome

68
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,660
so what do we need to make the mango

69
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,480
list you need milk and notice that this

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,520
is a glass bottle of milk why glass

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,080
because Plastics contain tablets and

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
tallets will leach into your milk and

73
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
that will make the milk essentially

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,340
toxic it'll poison your testosterone

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
production poison your hormonal

76
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,580
production and even if you're a woman

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
watching this salads aren't good for you

78
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,180
either it messes up your hormones as

79
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,140
much as it messes up any males hormones

80
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,060
and then we have some five percent Greek

81
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,220
yogurt so five percent is as much as you

82
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,140
can possibly get it's very fat filled

83
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,540
very highly calorie dense very

84
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,860
nutritious and very creamy so it adds a

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,019
good amount of flavor then they have

86
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,220
honey this is the really good quality

87
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,680
honey so when you're looking for honey

88
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,420
the best is to get local honey from a

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
local farm so this is what that is if

90
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,780
you aren't able to get that at least

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
look for raw and unfiltered the best is

92
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,560
unheated if you can get unheated honey

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,480
that's the best possible then we have

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,819
heavy whipping cream this is not an

95
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
essential ingredient but if you have it

96
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,640
then good for your red it'll taste

97
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
better it'll make the texture better and

98
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,300
then we have vanilla extract another

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
unconventional ingredient in this

100
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,159
mixture and of course we have the mango

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,040
chunk so you also need something to

102
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,200
measure with so what we do is well get

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,239
back to the Army Stories the best part

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,220
of army training especially looking back

105
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,019
is that for six months of your life no

106
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,140
it's more like seven months of your life

107
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,959
you're literally literally forced into

108
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,580
the most extreme monk mode you've ever

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:52,319
heard of no phones no internet no books

110
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,000
nothing just pure single-minded focus on

111
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,220
the training now don't get me wrong we

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
goofed off quite a lot but even then

113
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,700
there was no internet there was no

114
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,739
distraction there was no porn there was

115
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,900
no drugs there was no alcohol there was

116
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,340
no smoking so every possible sin that

117
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,799
you can imagine all the addictions of

118
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,299
modernity removed for seven months of my

119
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,939
life and I do believe that that

120
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,159
catalyzed some of my later successes so

121
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,680
first thing we need Greek yogurt so how

122
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,660
much Greek yogurt do we need we need one

123
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,940
cup of Greek yogurt so regarding

124
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,380
quantity right I'm gonna do a one is to

125
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,120
one is to one so I'm going to use the

126
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,979
same amount of yogurt as I'm going to

127
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,479
use of milk as I'm gonna use of heavy

128
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,979
whipping cream you can obviously adjust

129
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,080
these quantities depending on how much

130
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,520
you're making right so that's about one

131
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,860
cup a little less than one cup to be

132
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,699
honest another memorable memorable event

133
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,520
in my army training was the first time I

134
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,740
looked at the sky wearing night optic

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600
devices so nods night optic devices

136
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,400
basically you know the movies they have

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
the Green Vision that you can see at

138
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,780
night first off those are actually

139
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,020
amazing pieces of Kit if you look at the

140
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,940
sky wearing nods you will see how many

141
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,440
stars there actually are because it's

142
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,780
obviously very sensitive to light right

143
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,639
so if you can see say you know 10 000

144
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,320
stars with your naked eye you'll see a

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,180
hundred thousand stars with if you're

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,460
using your Night Vision Optics and it's

147
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,759
beautiful looking at the sky through the

148
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,580
night optic vision is one of my favorite

149
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,620
little stories from the from the Army so

150
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,199
we have about one cup of the Greek

151
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,699
yogurt more than sufficient go ahead and

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,160
put that away

153
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,620
but trust me when I tell you not every

154
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,300
single experience in army training is a

155
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,660
good one for example there's something

156
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,780
called land nav so Land Navigation I'm

157
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,979
adding one cup of milk more or less so

158
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,020
none of these quantities have to be

159
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,720
exact by the way so land nav is when

160
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,940
they put you into this nasty ass Forest

161
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,220
so I did my basic training at a place

162
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,840
called Fort Benning Georgia and trust me

163
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,360
you don't want to go to freaking Fort

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Benning Fort Benning is the home of the

165
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,600
Infantry it's where the Infantry is

166
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,940
trained and it's the worst it's the

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,039
absolute worst place on the planet it's

168
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,080
hot it's humid the forest literally

169
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,840
stinks there's so much decomposed

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,180
material on the forest floor it's just

171
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,539
nasty man the worst part is the spiders

172
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,520
man so there's big ass banana spiders so

173
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,400
the spiders like this big bigger than my

174
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,800
hand probably like wide big boys big

175
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,600
spiders they're everywhere like every

176
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,400
single two trees there's two trees

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,320
there's a freaking spider web between

178
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,560
them and a big old spider sitting right

179
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,060
in the center and this is a nasty nasty

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,860
Woods not the kind of nature like I like

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,840
nature but not this kind of nature you

182
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,819
know what I mean disgusting Woods big

183
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,100
ass spiders and it was hard to do land

184
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,440
nav so land nav is basically they give

185
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,180
you a map they give you a compass and

186
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,979
they give you a protractor and they give

187
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,660
you like a pen to Mark stuff and they

188
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,180
give you points on the map like you have

189
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,860
to go to these points and each point has

190
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,780
a number I needed to take the number

191
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,220
down so that when you come back you can

192
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,199
show your drill sergeant the number and

193
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,180
prove that you in fact found all the

194
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,740
points so during the daytime it's all

195
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,600
really hard because we have to go

196
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,039
through all these dense Woods trying to

197
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,780
avoid the spiders as much as possible

198
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,400
and then still find your points through

199
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,560
these swampy lands and there's like

200
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,180
actual snakes there was copperheads and

201
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,860
I've seen a copperhead in the in the

202
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,660
wild and it's just nasty and difficult

203
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,400
to get through terrain but it was hard

204
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,160
during the daytime in the night time it

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,080
was it was the worst I was trying to get

206
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,479
to a point at night and I remember

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,120
distinctly you use something called a

208
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,220
red lamp or a red lens when you're going

209
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,780
through the forest at night it's just a

210
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,220
red light flashlight and by the way

211
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,620
you're not actually allowed to use it at

212
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,539
night so during night land now it's

213
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,039
pitch black no light allowed nothing

214
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,080
allowed because you're trying to be as

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,819
stealthy as possible right so when I

216
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,699
turned on the red lamp just briefly to

217
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:38,759
see what's around me I see a hundred

218
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,860
thousand beady little eyes staring back

219
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,639
I didn't realize it but I was in the

220
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,039
center of those huge huge spider web and

221
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,620
if I had taken 10 steps forward I would

222
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,139
be drenched in spiders I still have that

223
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,039
memory it's disgusting immediately I was

224
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,199
like I don't care what the drill

225
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,300
sergeant says I am not walking through

226
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,860
there to get to my point so yeah I got

227
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,620
penalized but man I am not walking

228
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,199
through freaking spider nests so then we

229
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,720
add our heavy whipping cream so this is

230
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,580
going to be about 3 4 of a cup and

231
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,680
that's our mixture hopefully it's all

232
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,020
fits in here we'll we'll find out I

233
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,819
guess so I'm gonna go ahead and pour it

234
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,940
all through

235
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,979
there it is and yeah it all fits it's

236
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,539
good but land now wasn't all bad on

237
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,759
another night or maybe it was the same

238
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,900
night me and two other friends who I'm

239
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,419
not gonna name obviously because of

240
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,160
confidentiality reasons me and them we

241
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,620
we were doing land now we're trying to

242
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,060
find our points and we find this opening

243
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,099
in the forest all right we find this

244
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,020
huge opening in the forest so Fort

245
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,300
Benning Georgia is densely densely

246
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,880
forested so an opening in the forest is

247
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,979
is pretty uncommon for some reason this

248
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,899
huge patch of land had no trees had no

249
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,899
vegetation whatsoever it literally

250
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,000
looked like the surface of the Moon

251
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,399
completely Barren it was like Sandy and

252
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,339
gray for some reason I'm not sure why so

253
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,860
one thing we lose as adults is our

254
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,360
ability to play we don't do things just

255
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,920
for the sake of doing things you know

256
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,019
everything we do is calculated

257
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,360
everything is strategy everything is

258
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,160
tactics everything is for a goal when

259
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,160
you're a child you play just for the

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,800
sake of playing and during a brief

261
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,200
period very brief period of my time in

262
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,959
the Army basic training I actually got

263
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,060
to play so me and my two friends found

264
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,620
this weird Landing Zone like place in

265
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,899
the middle of nowhere in the middle of

266
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,940
Georgia's worst woods and for whatever

267
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,320
reason we it all got into our heads like

268
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,060
this is such a cool and interesting

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
place and we just played you know we

270
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,640
just ran for no reason we threw stones

271
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,100
for no reason we were jumping and acting

272
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,500
out the moon landing it was like we're

273
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,240
just frolicking for the fun of it and I

274
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,279
will never forget those moments we also

275
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,200
did other stupid things but those are

276
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,320
confidential and the armies where I

277
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,779
learned that you can sleep anywhere some

278
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,000
of the best sleep I've ever had was

279
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,980
literally curled up in a black trash bag

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,040
on the forest floor because it was

281
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,600
freezing and I slept like a baby right I

282
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,459
was still I still had my backpack on

283
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,740
because if they told you to go you need

284
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:07,140
you need to move so best sleep ever

285
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,360
sleeping with my backpack on in a trash

286
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,279
bag on the floor of a forest and then

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
also like even in the barracks right

288
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,339
you're not allowed to sleep in the

289
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,899
barracks at all if they find you

290
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,060
sleeping in the to get if I catch you

291
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,500
sleeping it's game over so you have to

292
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,540
be very stealthy with your sleep people

293
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,120
will sleep in the bathrooms people will

294
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,160
sleep under beds all kinds of things

295
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,200
some of the best sleep I got was

296
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,180
literally on the ground flat on the

297
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,800
ground with a rolled up t-shirt as a

298
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,360
pillow and I was knocked out for like

299
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,120
hours because we're just so tired all

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,459
the time and then we cannot forget to

301
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,160
add our honey so how much honey am I

302
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,380
adding I will add a good two solid

303
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,000
tablespoons of Honey because I don't

304
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,220
have a problem with honey I know it's

305
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,800
sugar but sugar isn't necessarily bad

306
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,720
for you it's the processed refined carbs

307
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,940
which mess you up I mean I'm not saying

308
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,019
go overboard with it right a little bit

309
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,620
of Honey isn't going to hurt you though

310
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:01,140
and then we start to blend it hopefully

311
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,800
oh my [ __ ] god

312
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,680
or damage control

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,620
so it already tastes really good

314
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,360
already it's nice refreshing drink

315
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,399
very flavorful this is just Frozen

316
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,779
mangoes you can use frozen mangoes

317
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
normal mangoes you can use whatever you

318
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,160
want

319
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,079
I got it strong mango taste which is

320
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
exactly what I want I'll actually add

321
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,200
some more mango so how much mango am I

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,779
adding I'm adding about a big handful of

323
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,339
mangoes and a splash of vanilla essence

324
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,260
this is not something you'll find in

325
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,180
traditional Indian recipes this is

326
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,640
something I added because it tastes good

327
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,640
and then we'll give it one last blend

328
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,860
and we are ready to serve another thing

329
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,140
I really disliked about the army or

330
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,660
basic trainings especially was the fact

331
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,060
that there is group punishment so what

332
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,399
group punishment is if one person messes

333
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,380
up the philosophy is everybody else

334
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,300
messes up too I understand where it's

335
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,579
coming from right if you're actually on

336
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,740
a battlefield and one person messes up

337
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,839
literally everybody could get killed so

338
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,000
I understand the philosophy but in

339
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,339
practice what happens is you may have

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,579
zero control over what somebody else is

341
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,920
doing but everybody gets punished for

342
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,240
the actions of one person and the fact

343
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,680
of the matter is some people just don't

344
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,940
care right some people just don't care

345
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,440
about doing well in the training

346
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,120
environment and they will keep messing

347
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,920
up because they simply don't care and

348
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,839
everybody else gets punished it's very

349
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,640
demoralizing you know you want to have

350
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,380
control over your destiny and that's

351
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,720
what actually helps people improve and

352
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,760
grow in life is when you feel that your

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,740
actions either bring your Rewards or

354
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,240
punishment but in the Army especially in

355
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,220
the basic training environment what I

356
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
found is it doesn't matter how good you

357
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,180
want to do or how bad you're doing the

358
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,040
end result is you get punished for

359
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,540
everybody else's behavior and you only

360
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,339
have so much control over what other

361
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,180
people are doing as a trainee you are

362
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,800
not going to be able to tell other

363
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,240
trainees what to do because they aren't

364
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
going to listen to you right somebody

365
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,000
wants to be a [ __ ] bag they're going to

366
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,180
be a [ __ ] bag I found this extremely

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,160
demoralizing I did my best in training

368
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,680
for the first few months and after that

369
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,720
I I wanted to give up because no matter

370
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,639
how good I did there's no reward

371
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,200
whatsoever it's only punishment and

372
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,480
that's not the way you set up a good

373
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,920
trading system so obviously I don't have

374
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,540
the authority to change anything about

375
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,639
training whatsoever so there's no point

376
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,700
in me even saying this but if you end up

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,820
going to some kind of army training then

378
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,980
expect unfairness if you do good you

379
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,540
won't be rewarded for it if you do bad

380
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,399
you'll get punished for it if somebody

381
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,620
else does bad you'll still get punished

382
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,300
for it so it's very demoralizing I don't

383
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,680
like the culture I don't like the logic

384
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,420
behind it I think you should get

385
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,899
rewarded for doing well but that's just

386
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,700
how it is and serving my extremely

387
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,779
esoteric

388
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:52,760
mango Lessie here we go look at that

389
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:56,339
Perfection ladies and gentlemen we have

390
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,980
the perfect summer drink finally they

391
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,139
have some sun here in the Midwest using

392
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,120
a metal straw why because we want a

393
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,139
white Plastics is that right and then

394
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,139
how does it taste

395
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,540
so good it's hard to communicate taste

396
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,880
or video right but this stuff is just so

397
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,000
good it tastes like you're drinking a

398
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,339
mango it's amazing you gotta try it I

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,740
know you guys like my esoteric eggnog

400
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,139
recipe this tastes even better than that

401
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,120
if possible now it's not as good in

402
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,100
terms of nutrition as the eggnog recipe

403
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,660
because that has eggs and it has fats

404
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,579
but this isn't that bad either because

405
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,920
it still has fats from the milk and

406
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,260
heavy cream and the Greek yogurt Greek

407
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,180
yogurt is a power ingredient so this is

408
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,980
a very healthy drink now the honey and

409
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,540
the mango make it very carbohydrate Rich

410
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,800
makes it very sugary so if you wanted to

411
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,660
you can just decrease the amount of

412
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,120
mango and honey and make it more

413
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,320
nutritionally optimized but it's up to

414
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,360
you right if you want to go for taste

415
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,360
like how I did then enjoy it own it
