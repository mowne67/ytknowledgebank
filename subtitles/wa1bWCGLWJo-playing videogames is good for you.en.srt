1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,879
some of my Fondest Memories were

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,160
actually playing Assassin's Creed 2 back

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,080
in the day when it came out I remember

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,360
playing the game doing the missions and

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
going to school discussing them with my

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,639
friends me and my closest friend at the

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,760
time we would discuss the weapon sets

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,199
the armors all these Secret locations in

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,680
the game we discussed the music the art

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,480
the culture the characters the story our

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,640
language our way of speaking even

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,000
evolved we learned new words from that

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,759
game and even to this day so a couple

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,640
months ago I was in the City of Florence

15
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,680
and I remember just looking at all the

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,440
real architecture there and remembering

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,200
looking at the same exact structures in

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
the game years and years ago as a child

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,480
and now I had the means to just go to

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,039
the City of Florence and enjoy it in

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,399
real life a real highlight for me this

22
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,039
year was to go to the top of the Duomo

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,320
in Florence and get that exact same view

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
that edzio gets when he reaches the top

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,920
of that building a lot of us have

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,800
forgotten what video games can be video

27
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,280
games are a beautiful medium they can be

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,760
just as valuable as a great piece P of

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,600
fiction a good story and for the same

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,479
reasons a piece of classical literature

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,520
or a beautifully written story a work of

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,280
fiction can be immensely valuable it

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,880
teaches you storytelling skills it

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,680
teaches you an appreciation for

35
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,119
Aesthetics it teaches you ethics and

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,799
morality and indeed some of the deepest

37
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,640
truths of human nature are discovered in

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,880
fiction in stories and not in self-help

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,079
books and business books as much as we

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,720
who like to improve oursel are obsessed

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,680
with improving productivity and learning

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
new business skills and improving our

43
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,920
lead generation and all this all these

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,399
are valuable definitely but we should

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,880
not pursue these at the cost of our

46
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,240
moral ethical and aesthetic development

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,759
and some video games not all of them can

48
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,560
play a role in this when I was in

49
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,439
Tuscany this summer I remember looking

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
at the Orchards and Vineyards and

51
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,840
remembering it looks exactly like what

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
was in Witcher 3 when Gerald runs his

53
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,200
horse across these Meadows and those who

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,799
watch my videos on the Roman Empire and

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,079
its demise and what we can learn from

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,920
that in the modern society you will know

57
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,079
that I'm big into history and one of the

58
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,520
reasons for this is because back in the

59
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,920
day I used to play a lot of Age of

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,960
Empires and playing age of the empires

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,800
gave me the Curiosity to learn more I

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,520
used to browse on the internet I had

63
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,720
even this encyclopedia which I used to

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,000
go to history books and I learned about

65
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,680
various cultures I learned about the

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,519
Greeks the Romans the ruts the Samurai

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,239
and the Mongols I learned about all

68
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,120
these cultures as a result of that game

69
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,000
so you could say that Age of Empires did

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,080
actually shape my intellectual growth

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,800
but it's not always Sunshine trust me

72
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,360
later I picked up a very specific game

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
called Rome to Total War and this is

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,680
where the trouble starts all the games

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,879
that I mentioned so far except age of

76
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,160
the empires are pretty non replayable

77
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,720
you can just play them once you get

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,400
through the story and that's your

79
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,280
entertainment from that game but Total

80
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,480
War Rome 2 was very replayable and

81
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,120
here's the problem this game was

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,480
perfectly designed to to addict my

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,400
psyche specifically when I talk of games

84
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,360
like Assassin's Creed The Witcher and

85
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,040
even AJ vampires I kind of talk about it

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
with fondness I remember those memories

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
those are great times playing those

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,239
games discussing it with friends

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,760
obsessing over strategy getting to know

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
these unit types and unlocking cool

91
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,760
weapons earning new armors and learning

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,360
and developing strategies from other

93
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,959
people who are playing the game and

94
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,440
having it even influence our fashion

95
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,200
sense and all these like little little

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
things details which really made the

97
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
game come to life for us as a child I

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560
don't talk about any of that fondness

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,799
when it comes to Rome 2 this game was

100
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,680
like crack to me I was genuinely

101
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,959
addicted to this and it all comes down

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,200
to the context the greater context of my

103
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,040
life so had just got into college and

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
this was a huge change which I wasn't

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,560
prepared for high school and middle

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
school for me were not a challenge I

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
enjoyed it I had a great time in high

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,319
school and middle school I was not the

109
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
victim of bullying I was smart enough to

110
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,159
get decent grades I was Notorious in

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
school for having discipline issues and

112
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,120
answering back to teachers and things

113
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,239
like this but this only kind of brose my

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
popularity so to speak and I had

115
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,840
acceptable levels of of interest from

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,680
girls and everything so high school and

117
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,319
middle school were fine for me I enjoyed

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,480
it but as as soon as I came to college

119
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,159
it was a the complete reset I had status

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,920
and it was all gone in a matter of a day

121
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,640
I started from scratch no status

122
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,159
whatsoever and looking back at it now

123
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,360
it's I suppose it's kind of childish but

124
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,120
at the time it mattered a lot I was

125
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
alone I had no friends I was confused

126
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,720
and to be honest the reason I was

127
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
choosing to do engineering was to some

128
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,199
extent because I felt like I had no

129
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,639
other option I didn't even know other

130
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,560
options existed I hadn't put in enough

131
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,240
intention I hadn't explored enough and I

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,600
was just following the track which I

133
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,639
felt I had really no other paths to

134
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,240
follow this lack of Direction the

135
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
loneliness and the feeling that I didn't

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,520
have control over my destiny all

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,440
combined to make it ripe for me to fall

138
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,759
into an addiction and Rome 2 was that

139
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,120
addiction for me you see Rome 2 is an

140
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,120
interesting game it's it's a strategy

141
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,440
game it's a very complex game with

142
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,400
thousands of moving Parts it's an empire

143
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,039
building game where you have control

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
over various settlements each settlement

145
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,360
has their own buildings there's a whole

146
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,560
economy to manage and on top of that

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,240
there's these realtime battles where

148
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,000
where you are kind of the general you're

149
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,880
looking at the battlefield from above

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,759
and you can move your unit around create

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,240
the perfect formation the perfect Shield

152
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,160
wall you can use hammer and annal

153
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,199
tactics you can choose heavy shock

154
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,880
Cavalry or you can choose melee Cavalry

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,240
you can choose horse archers you can

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,280
choose foot archers there was hundreds

157
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,919
of units to choose from there was

158
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,400
Byzantine catari there was Roman

159
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,440
priorians there was Spartan hopl lights

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
there was rodian Slingers there was

161
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,639
baleric Slingers there was different

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
Technologies to research There Was You

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,919
Know Siege engines there was this there

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,199
was that it was rich it was so rich and

165
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
and here's the thing in real life I had

166
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,639
no status but in that game I had massive

167
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,520
status in that game I was a general I

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,199
was a commander of men I had armies to

169
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,000
my name I had Legions I had settlements

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,919
that would answer to my command and the

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,319
problem solving aspect what do you do

172
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,759
when an invasion occurs from a border

173
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,560
which you didn't really guard what do

174
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,759
you do when your econom is collapsing

175
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,919
but barbarians are at the gates this

176
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,440
game was designed is a massive puzzle a

177
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,560
problem solving exercise with multiple

178
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,039
moving pieces all of them which interact

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,479
with each other and you have to have a

180
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,199
lot of knowledge and a lot of

181
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,560
understanding to play your pieces right

182
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,319
and that aspect and being rewarded for

183
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,319
knowledge and hard work was very much

184
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
addictive to me it was crack to me man I

185
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,160
just dove into it and my entire freshman

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,199
year of college I became an expert in

187
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,240
that one game putting hundreds of hours

188
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
into it and you know there was no real

189
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,400
benefit in the end of the day had I

190
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,720
played that game for just a couple hours

191
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
here and there that would be fun I would

192
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,280
have learned some history I would have

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
learned cool unit types which existed in

194
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,440
real life I would have gained a new

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,720
aesthetic understanding and I would have

196
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,240
of course had some Leisure and some

197
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,840
downtime but that's not how I treated

198
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,599
the game I treated the game as my career

199
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,000
and so no I do not remember this

200
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,360
particular game and this period of my

201
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,319
life at any fondness and to this day I

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
avoid playing any Total War games

203
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,440
because I know that my psyche is kind of

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
vulnerable to that kind of game so how

205
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,520
do you actually overcome this addiction

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
I didn't overcome the addiction what

207
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,639
happened was my computer died and I

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
couldn't afford a better computer Compu

209
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,639
and so I was forced to stop playing and

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
this at the time yeah of course it

211
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,039
caused pain but by God that was a

212
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,879
pivotal movement for me losing my laptop

213
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,479
my gaming laptop so if you're addicted

214
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,960
to video games trust me just toss out

215
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,479
your computer get yourself a Mac which

216
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,080
doesn't even have games and your

217
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,400
productivity will just Skyrocket and so

218
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,240
my second year of college I didn't have

219
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,160
that same addiction to Rome 2 I had

220
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,800
moved on I joined a fraternity which

221
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,639
that's a separate story for a different

222
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,560
time I had a different kind of social

223
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,319
life alog together and then I detached

224
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,360
from that I separated from that and I

225
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,800
created a more wholesome friend Circle I

226
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,479
picked up a whole bunch of different new

227
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,199
hobbies I learned how to do ballroom

228
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,280
dance for example and things started to

229
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,159
become better because I was more mature

230
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,199
I knew myself better I knew what not to

231
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,840
do I knew what to do I had developed my

232
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,520
social skills I developed my presence

233
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,440
and overall I was just a more mature

234
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,479
individual so if you feel right now that

235
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,759
you're young and dumb and you're getting

236
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,919
addicted to all kinds of pointless

237
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,879
things you have no Direction well that's

238
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,159
everybody's story man you you will

239
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,360
figure it out you have time the worst

240
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,919
thing you can do for yourself right now

241
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
is live in anxiety and hopelessness have

242
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,080
faith in yourself first and foremost and

243
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,039
then you can begin to direct your life

244
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,360
towards a higher purpose just have blind

245
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,560
faith faith in oneself which is

246
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,960
completely irrational completely blind

247
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,960
is the biggest asset that you can

248
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,080
cultivate so last year of college I had

249
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,560
a genuinely wonderful friend Circle I

250
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
was practicing martial arts I was

251
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,000
practicing ballroom dance I had

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
something going for me and of course

253
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,599
then

254
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,719
I graduated and everybody I knew was

255
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,919
scattered and they went their own ways

256
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,240
for their own jobs across the country

257
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,120
and that was another reset back to zero

258
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,880
you know no status no nothing no friends

259
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
again this time I was also kind of burnt

260
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,600
out from college and finishing my degree

261
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,200
and everything and I had downtime I

262
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,920
wasn't ready to go get a job I wanted

263
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,839
some time to just relax and wind down I

264
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,959
picked up a game I picked up a video

265
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,880
game called BioShock Infinite and this

266
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,320
game was awesome man if you haven't

267
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
played BioShock Infinite you got to get

268
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,839
into it I know a fan of firstperson

269
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,200
Shooters myself but the storyline and

270
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,399
the visuals and the Aesthetics of

271
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,640
BioShock Infinite make it completely

272
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
worth it BioShock Infinite is a master

273
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
class in storytelling and building up

274
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,279
suspense and having foreshadowing for an

275
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,480
eventual massive plot TST and the story

276
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,200
line is as good as any work of fiction

277
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,760
or any kind of movie youve ever watched

278
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,360
and it's a video game which is my point

279
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,040
my point is a video game is nothing but

280
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
a medium it can genuinely be a work of

281
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,040
art make sure that you're choosing games

282
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
which are not replayable like BioShock

283
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,959
Infinite once you go through the story

284
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,920
learn the game play and finish out your

285
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,399
missions like you don't feel like going

286
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
back and playing it again and if you do

287
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,440
it's probably going to be in a year or

288
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
two because of nostalgia and that's fine

289
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,480
games like League or fortnite or

290
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,040
something like this which is extremely

291
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,800
replayable or Call of Duty these are the

292
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,399
ones which have serious addiction risk

293
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,079
or of course like RuneScape and stuff if

294
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,720
you were back in the day and once I

295
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,640
played BioShock Infinite I was not

296
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,279
addicted able to go and try different

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,120
things I was able to even create an

298
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,800
e-commerce business so after I got done

299
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,640
with all that I actually invented this

300
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,120
so it doesn't seem like much does it but

301
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,320
get this all right so this is a robe and

302
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,560
the interesting thing about this is it

303
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,720
has a loop and button system so when you

304
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,560
have your robe on you can actually pull

305
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
the sleeve back and draw out this loop

306
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,399
system which has a button which it goes

307
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,519
into so you can actually roll up the

308
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,480
sleeve and cinch it in place which is

309
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,399
not any great Innovation admittedly but

310
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,920
this was something I'm proud of to be

311
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,519
honest it was a kind of a simp first

312
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,760
product which I tried I got into markets

313
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,399
I ordered product off China brought it

314
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,079
all the way here had inventory sold a

315
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,959
couple on Shopify through Instagram ads

316
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,040
then of course Co happened and there was

317
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,440
a huge iOS update those who are in

318
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,320
e-commerce know what I'm talking about

319
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
and yeah my company died like overnight

320
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,120
and that was fine cuz the amount I

321
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,240
learned from that company my first ever

322
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,279
business venture makes life so much

323
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,560
easier today so will I ever play video

324
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,279
games in the future do I actually

325
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
recommend playing games well here's the

326
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,639
thing I'm waiting for one specific game

327
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,800
and that is Space Marine 2 when Space

328
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,440
Marine 2 comes out you bet I'm going to

329
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,839
play the [ __ ] out of it hell I might

330
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,720
even stream it on YouTube I am really

331
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,800
excited for that one game and see here's

332
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,399
the thing I am mature enough to be able

333
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,120
to balance my business manage my

334
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,320
personal life and a Leisure and hobby

335
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,160
activity that's fine it's all a matter

336
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,000
of one understanding yourself your

337
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,720
strengths and weaknesses and two

338
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,240
assessing your lifestyle and your goals

339
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
to understand how much leisure time you

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
actually have and three having the

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
discipline to actually control yourself

342
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,519
and four actually choosing the right

343
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,800
games choose games that are genuinely

344
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,920
going to be enjoyable to you and are not

345
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,760
replayable so what games were important

346
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
to you when you were younger were there

347
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,040
any standout games which kind of defined

348
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,959
you as a person if so leave a comment I

349
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,760
do read these comments and of course are

350
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,240
any of the games which were in my list

351
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,639
in yours just like video games and

352
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,000
indeed works of fiction which means

353
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,480
story books some movies can also be

354
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,720
really good I'll have two TI pop up one

355
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,360
is going to be a video on why reading

356
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,560
fiction is good and going to give you

357
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
recommendations on what fiction to read

358
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,320
and the second is going to be my review

359
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
of the movie Napoleon and why it fails

360
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,079
to be what it could have been and in

361
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,199
that video I speak of the truth of

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
Napoleon's story and what you can learn

363
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,720
from that to improve your mindset right

364
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
now
