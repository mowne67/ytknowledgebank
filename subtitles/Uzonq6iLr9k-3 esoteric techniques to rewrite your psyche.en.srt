1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,600
ever brainwashed myself was to get girls

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,720
and I use the first two techniques here

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,080
logos and mental rehearsals so this was

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,040
no ordinary girl man she was special I

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,440
was walking down the central atrium of

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,240
my big Library building in my University

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,199
and I see this girl in the corner of my

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,519
eye she had red hair which caught my

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,920
attention she was wearing green moss

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,439
green which was my favorite color so

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,160
immediately I was interested I I saw her

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
she was wearing gold rim glasses which I

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,240
think the glint of that is what caught

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,960
my eye in the first place she had like a

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,960
gold uh not gold gold and Jade locket on

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
and she was Dro dead gorgeous she kind

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,520
of looked Irish she had the perfect

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,920
physique it was kind of um fall season

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,199
so she was wearing the fall you know the

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,760
kind of things which girls wear during

21
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,920
the fall she looked like a work of art

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,039
all right and I was very desirous you

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,559
know ravenous I was desirous of going

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,320
and talking to her well I was desirous

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,719
of a little bit more than that but let's

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,399
keep it familyfriendly all right so I

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,559
take take a step I'm going towards her

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,280
and immediately there's an objection in

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,320
my mind she's busy like she's plugged in

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
like she has her airpods on she has her

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,439
laptop in front of her she's clearly

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,159
intent on whatever she's doing like I

33
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,159
couldn't go and you know interrupt her

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
she's maybe she's taking the quiz right

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,560
maybe she's listening to a lecture from

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,400
her professor right I shouldn't go and

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,600
talk to her right now she's not

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,079
receptive I also see this people Milling

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,280
around so it's objection number two this

40
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,600
people these like nerds who are going to

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,159
listen to my conversation if I try to

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,520
pull moves like everybody's going to

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,759
know everybody's going to hear it it's

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,840
going to be kind of cringe so I don't

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,759
really want that and I take another step

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,880
even despite the objection and a third

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,720
objection appears in my mind she

48
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,399
probably has a boyfriend a girl like

49
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,360
that is not going to be single for very

50
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,040
long she probably is taken and I could

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,680
put in all this risk and effort and

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,799
everything and there would be no point

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,520
because she's obviously going to be

54
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,280
taken put another step forward still

55
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,880
walking towards her she's this close she

56
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,079
her table and like she's working on on

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,280
her laptop and I just walk past her I

58
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,360
just walk past

59
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,520
her I want you to remember this phrase

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,360
rejection is always better than

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
regret I walk past her and I keep

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,959
walking along I go to my classes I'm

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
still thinking about this chick and I do

64
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,400
my classes I'm walking the opposite

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,239
direction but when I'm walking the

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,200
opposite direction I see her computer

67
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,319
screen she's not busy she's not doing a

68
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,720
quiz she's on Netflix she just

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,640
distracted like everybody else so

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
immediately my first objection is proven

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,040
to be false by direct

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
observation and I realized maybe the

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,480
second and third objections are also

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,000
incorrect so I I analyze this I'm

75
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,400
looking at it

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,360
logically like there's people around and

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,080
they are going to hear but if the price

78
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,840
to pay is a bunch of dbes listening in

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,920
that's a price that I'm willing to pay

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,080
if all that's standing behind me and

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,239
banging this girl's brains out it's a

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,599
bunch of onlookers who probably not even

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,640
going to remember me the next day then

84
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm willing to pay that price any day

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,959
right I'm willing to pay that price so

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,280
second objection is immediately

87
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,400
destroyed third objection is she has a

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,040
boyfriend but I don't know that I don't

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
know if she has a boyfriend why am I

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,799
placing an objection in front of myself

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
which I don't even know to be true for

92
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,840
all I know she could be receptive maybe

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,519
she's single I don't know and I

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
shouldn't be putting a defeat in in

95
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,439
front of myself before I even make an

96
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,080
attempt

97
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,120
so I was like okay I don't even have any

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,280
objections anymore I have to talk to her

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
but even so my body doesn't cooperate I

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,280
am not able to go and speak to this

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
chick and I sit down I sit down and I'm

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,760
like okay I'm going to practice this

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319
before I go so in my mind I'm

104
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,120
visualizing how this is going to play

105
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,360
out like the entire scenario I walk up

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,000
to her pull the chair and I'm like hey

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,439
is this seat taken she's probably going

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,280
to say no it's not taken go ahead and so

109
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,280
I'll sit down I'll pull out my laptop

110
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,400
act like I'm doing something thank you

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,840
what's your name and she would say her

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,640
name and she can do one of two things

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,480
she

114
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,319
could she could just continue her work

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
in which case she's either not

116
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,519
interested at all or she's actually busy

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,720
and I should leave her alone fine or she

118
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,160
could say and what's

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,160
yours that means she is in that means

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,240
one she's willing to be distracted and

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
two she's either attracted or at least

122
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,320
curious and I'll take that right I'll

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,960
take that any day so that was my

124
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,759
objective that was my mission parameters

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,360
so I do exactly as I rehearsed I walk up

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,919
pull the chair ask if I can sit down she

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,800
says yes I ask her what's her name Avery

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,840
she says and what's yours she says it in

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,560
a kind of cheerful and girly kind of way

130
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm in it's already a success I'm

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,000
already meeting 100% of mission

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,120
parameters I've already won I don't care

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,960
at that point I genuinely didn't care

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
what happen in a conversation whether I

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,840
get her number or not it doesn't matter

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,560
I've already done what I said I would do

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,160
using the power of mental rehearsal and

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
logos so I'm going to explain these in

139
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,680
autistic level details so that you can

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,199
actually use them in real life but

141
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,800
perhaps you want me to finish the story

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,880
so I talked to this chick and this girl

143
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,400
has girl game so just as we as men have

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
a certain level of Charisma and game

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,199
when when we talk to girls right she had

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
the girls equivalent of this she didn't

147
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,400
need it she was Dro dead gorgeous and

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,120
she didn't need any kind of social

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
skills to be more attractive I don't

150
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,520
even know if she could be more

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,919
attractive she was kind of pale skinned

152
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,960
but her lips were still you know bright

153
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,680
and attractive she had green eyes moss

154
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,960
green eyes which is my favorite color

155
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,840
like I said she was playing with her

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
locket she was playing with her hair her

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,199
voice was a little bit high pitched she

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,199
was doing that thing which girls do when

159
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,600
they're kind of interested they'll kind

160
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,000
of bunch their shoulders and kind of

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,759
move side to side she was doing that she

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,840
was telling her telling me about

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,800
herself our conversation was objectively

164
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,680
not flotation if you just look at the

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,919
words we're just speaking about you know

166
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,160
future goals and like all kind of benal

167
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,919
lame

168
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
stuff but it was in the eye contact

169
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,400
flirtation the only difference between

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,880
flirtation and a conversation is the eye

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,880
contact and Body Language I of course

172
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,639
that might be a topic for a different

173
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,000
video like how do you actually talk to

174
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,160
girls and everything but

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
fine let's let's leave that for a

176
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,160
different video right so I talk to this

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,680
girl get her number uh if I did that

178
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,479
today like with what I know now I would

179
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,479
go for the same day date 100% of the

180
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,560
time

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,360
easy but I went for the number which was

182
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,000
fine got her number and I should say

183
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,919
this don't go for the insta go for the

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,800
number rather than insta unless you have

185
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,039
more than 5,000 followers on Insta if

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,240
you have more than 5,000 it means that

187
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,479
you have some clout and it actually

188
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,919
might help build up her attraction but

189
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,280
if not go for the number it's more

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,639
direct it's just more sexual Instagram

191
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,160
is kind of um androgynous you know guys

192
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,560
ask guys for their insta girls ask girls

193
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,440
for their insta it's just it's not

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,840
necessarily intimate the phone number is

195
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,360
necessarily intimate so go for the phone

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,039
number 100% of the time unless you're

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,479
actually famous on

198
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,800
Insta starting to rain here which is

199
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,879
fine I've done stuff in rain before

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,720
that's for sure so that's mental

201
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,599
rehearsal and logos let's run through

202
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,440
the autistic level steps and and

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,440
speaking of which after the date I will

204
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,879
just say

205
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,240
that she's a very loving girl let's

206
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,199
let's leave it at that she's a very

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,560
loving individual it didn't work out

208
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,159
long term because like this girl like

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,680
she was she had a notch count on her and

210
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,919
she was one of those girls who had the

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
popular on Tinder badge so like she

212
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,000
wasn't the right girl for a long-term

213
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,879
relationship but you know I have no

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
regrets whatsoever all right so let's

215
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,000
just leave it at that and go into the

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,599
actual actionable steps so the first

217
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,599
technique Tech I told you was logos

218
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,360
logos is a technique to use against

219
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,400
limiting beliefs so first you need to

220
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,960
isolate and detect limiting beliefs what

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,120
you do is whenever you have something

222
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,840
that you want to pursue but you don't

223
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,120
pursue it because of some reason analyze

224
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
what that reason is that reason is a

225
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,800
limiting belief you use logic to analyze

226
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,360
the belief is this actually objectively

227
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,039
true or is it something which I'm making

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,840
up or something which I've picked up

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,000
along the course of my life most of the

230
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,639
time it's going to be the latter and

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,560
anybody can fall into this trap is

232
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,200
somebody which you and I both respect he

233
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,279
had a limiting belief about money he

234
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,080
thought that if he sold something he

235
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200
would lose his audience not the case

236
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,959
he's still growing people love him and

237
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,560
he's making hell lot of

238
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,560
money I had a limiting belief about

239
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,519
sleep I thought that I was an insomniac

240
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,920
turns out that I could not fall asleep

241
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,399
if I had an unproductive day and because

242
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
I was at that phase of my life I was

243
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,720
unproductive basically every day I

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,920
didn't get

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,640
sleep and so analyze your beliefs

246
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,320
destroy them see if they're actually

247
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,839
true I was abusing melatonin for years

248
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,440
up to that point I realized that

249
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,560
melatonin is not actually good for you

250
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,920
and I should stop I like am I actually

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
an insomniac or is it something which

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,399
I've made up in my mind and because I

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
realized it was something I made up in

254
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,600
my mind I was able to destroy it that's

255
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,160
logos the second technique is mental

256
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,279
rehearsals mental rehearsals are kind of

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,880
what I described in that story acting

258
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,360
out the thing that you're going to do in

259
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,640
the mind before you actually do it and

260
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,120
to do this you're using your eye the eye

261
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,839
of your mind basically the Mind's Eye

262
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,600
and I'll prove to you that you have a

263
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,600
Mind's Eye all right I want you to

264
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,399
visualize this imagine this it's raining

265
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,640
right now I kind of like it I like the

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,880
rain imagine it's raining all right it's

267
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,200
a dark and stormy night and there's an

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,880
old man he's he's bundled up in his

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,440
robes he's feeling cold his bones are

270
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,519
achy he's walking and he has this

271
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,000
crooked cane that he carries around with

272
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,480
him and in a in a puddle to the left of

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,720
him he hears a sound and it's a little

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,320
baby bird he picks it up and it's

275
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,720
showering it's pouring and this little

276
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,680
bird he cows it in his cloak and says

277
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,519
hey little one you're safe now you could

278
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,440
imagine that couldn't you you could

279
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,240
visualize this entire scene couldn't you

280
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,079
that's your mind's eye now you don't

281
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,959
have to visualize others people's

282
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,040
stories you can make that story and

283
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,040
visualize it yourself in your own mind

284
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,519
when you do that you're actually putting

285
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,480
in the Reps when you do that you're

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,440
putting in the Reps and this is a

287
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
technique which is used in sports all

288
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,440
the time Elite level coaches mediocre

289
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,360
coaches don't do this but Elite level

290
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,680
coaches do this all the time especially

291
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,200
in tennis and golf they will teach the

292
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,480
correct form to their athletes and ask

293
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,240
the athlete to visualize the form not

294
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,120
even actually physically do it just

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,160
imagine what muscles are Contracting and

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
how the wind blows across your forearm

297
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,920
as you strike the ball visualize it

298
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,720
right and you can this is very common in

299
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,480
tennis you can actually visualize the

300
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,480
ball coming in across the net taking a

301
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,920
bounce Twang and you see the balls going

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,279
in the exact trajectory that you had

303
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,920
charted out for it you can use this for

304
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,320
music you can use this for public

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
speaking so I actually do mental

306
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,079
rehearsals for these videos and these

307
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,880
lectures I do three mental rehearsals

308
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,279
one immediately after I conceptualize

309
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,279
and kind of script out my lecture second

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,839
at any random point in the day and the

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,519
third right before I sleep why do this

312
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,600
it because it's because it tells your

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,839
REM sleep mind what to dream about and

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
in your dreams you run through the

315
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:46,120
scenario like 500,000 times so basically

316
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,000
I have like a 500,000 or 5,000 reps

317
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,040
before I even give this lecture which is

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
why I'm able to do it with relative ease

319
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,600
and fluidity I don't have to be sad

320
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,000
there or I don't have to consult notes I

321
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,120
have no notes around me right

322
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,240
now so that's mental rehearsals you can

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,959
use it for practically anything

324
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,600
life-changing technique highly recommend

325
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,279
you use it now the question is like why

326
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,560
should you be brainwashing yourself

327
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,320
anyway well I'll tell you this that

328
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,399
everybody's Brainwashed the only

329
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,399
question is who's brainwashing you and

330
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,199
what they're brainwashing you with even

331
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,720
the great men of history have been

332
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,920
brainwashed Alexander was brainwashed by

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
his mother into believing that he was

334
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,079
semi-immortal

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,040
divine you know General and he

336
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,959
manifested that in real life didn't he

337
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,199
he truly believed himself to be great

338
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,120
and Immortal he Le the charge from the

339
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:39,639
front he was the first man to charge

340
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,320
into Enemy Lines every time his his

341
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,880
companions he had this Elite Cavalry

342
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,320
called the companion Cavalry they would

343
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,760
try to race him and get there first but

344
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,600
they couldn't Alexander was always

345
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,920
number one guy on the battlefield

346
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,800
Napoleon brainwashed himself Napoleon

347
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,320
brainwashed himself and he did so he was

348
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
living in the island of Corsica which is

349
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,720
like a poor little island off the coast

350
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,839
of France and Frenchmen actually they

351
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,160
despise or you know they see corsicans

352
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,240
as beneath them when Napoleon was in

353
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,360
Corsica he would used to imagine war

354
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,399
games and strategies if Corsica was

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,440
invaded by a foreign Force what would he

356
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,000
do where would he place the Cannons what

357
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
would be the Arc of Fire where would he

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,279
place his battalions where would he

359
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
place his ships and everything of course

360
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,240
when he became a general he had already

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,880
put in a, 5,000 10,000 reps before

362
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,040
commanding his first battle

363
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,519
so if the great men of history

364
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,040
brainwashed themsel I can do that you

365
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,519
can do that everybody should be doing

366
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,800
that and that brings us to the next um

367
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,040
technique which I'm going to sh share

368
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
with you which is the art of future

369
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,399
sight so future site is an advanced

370
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,360
version of the mental

371
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,360
rehearsal future sight you're not

372
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,519
practicing a given skill you are instead

373
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,440
practicing the version of yourself that

374
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,560
you're going to become in a year or

375
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,920
two's time for me me personally I

376
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,440
manifest or I wouldn't say manifest I

377
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,240
imagine I imagine the 30-year-old

378
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,040
version of myself every morning after I

379
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,920
do the three s's so my morning routine

380
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,959
is ultra simple Sunshine salt which is

381
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,519
electrolytes and uh shower shower salt

382
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,360
and sunshine after I get these three my

383
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,160
morning routine is basically done I'll

384
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,040
sit down outside on a porch chair and I

385
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,199
visualize the version of myself when I'm

386
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,320
30 years of age I see my Palms are

387
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,240
callous due to the weightlifting I can

388
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,279
see my forearms are big I can feel that

389
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,000
my neck is thicker I can feel that my

390
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,560
voice is more deep I can feel I've have

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,759
grown out my hair I can feel that I have

392
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,320
a beard because at this point my

393
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,000
military contract would be done and

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,000
actually have a beard I can imagine this

395
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,920
version of myself his ability to speak

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
is you know unparalleled he he has

397
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,959
perfect enunciation he can command the

398
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,920
room he can tell these stories which are

399
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,240
gripping and emotionally resonant he has

400
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,000
this voice that commands the room people

401
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,720
actually listen they want to listen to

402
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,600
him starting to pour out here

403
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,920
boys that's the version of myself that I

404
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,120
need to be right now essentially what

405
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,959
I'm doing is I'm bringing the version

406
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,560
which I will be to the

407
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:24,160
present so how does one do

408
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,759
this one does this by focusing on the

409
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,560
details what does your hands look like

410
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,560
what does your mind feel like most most

411
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,120
importantly so I visualized the

412
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
30-year-old version of's mind being like

413
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,560
a Lake

414
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,199
Placid glacial calm but when there's

415
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,399
something to do a task to be achieved

416
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:49,000
100% Focus like a laser cutting through

417
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,880
steel that's the mind which I want to

418
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,720
have just as you put in the Reps in the

419
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
gym to improve your muscles you put in

420
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,319
reps in your mind to improve your

421
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,319
mind and finally we have the final

422
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,519
technique which is

423
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,880
lucid dreaming is a weird technique and

424
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm not going to go into it too deeply

425
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,279
in this video tomorrow's lecture is

426
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,880
going to be lucid dreaming because lucid

427
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,839
dreaming has risks it has risks involved

428
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,600
the other three techniques which I

429
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,800
showed you anybody can do it you can do

430
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,120
it how many other times you want there's

431
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,120
no risks it's all benefit but lucid

432
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,120
dreaming is something which I used to do

433
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,720
I stopped doing for a long time I'm

434
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,880
starting again right now so I'll explain

435
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
why and the risks and the rewards so

436
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,560
lucid dreaming for those who don't know

437
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,600
is the art and skill of able to control

438
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,639
your dreams you can

439
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
actually dream about the thing which you

440
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,000
want to get good at and do the Reps in

441
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,839
your dreams so Tim Ferris actually is

442
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,360
was the one who introduced me to this

443
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,120
Tim Ferris actually says that he got

444
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,040
good at wrestling because he used to

445
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,639
practice wrestling in his

446
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,600
dreams and it's true man you practice

447
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,519
the thing in your dreams and it carries

448
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,959
over to real life they did experiments

449
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,600
about this too so it's not like just me

450
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,480
making some stuff up the actual

451
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,000
scientific literature does exist now

452
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,440
I'll go into the exact techniques in the

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,160
lecture tomorrow so if you want to visit

454
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,280
that then you absolutely should it's a

455
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,439
powerful technique it has some risks but

456
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,079
if you're mature enough to use it

457
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,480
correctly it can be extremely powerful

458
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm using lucid dreaming right now to

459
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,919
get good at speaking without edits like

460
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,520
speaking without relying on cuts and you

461
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,000
know AI generated Graphics to get a good

462
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,720
video so that's lucid dreaming I'm going

463
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,400
to talk about it in detail tomorrow and

464
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,600
I have a challenge for you all these

465
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,840
lectures they are not free there is a

466
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,600
fee to be paid in the in the effort that

467
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,640
you put in the challenge for today is

468
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
choose one of the first three techniques

469
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,160
either you're choosing logos mental

470
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,640
rehearsal or the future site and what

471
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,160
you're going to do is you're going to en

472
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,880
enact that technique and you are going

473
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,240
to give us a report of your experience

474
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,799
with that so if you're on YouTube you

475
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,120
can leave a comment saying this is a

476
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,520
technique I used and this is what I

477
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,600
learned if you're on Call's Country Club

478
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,559
do it inside the community instead

479
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,120
finally the yesterday's lesson was one

480
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,840
on purpose if you want to watch that
