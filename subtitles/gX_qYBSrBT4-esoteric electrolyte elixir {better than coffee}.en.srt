1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,620
the esoteric electrolyte Elixir this is

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,799
how you make it you need

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,460
honey you need table salt you need

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,340
potassium citrate you need magnesium

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,560
malate so you have three ions you have

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,539
the Magnesium you have the potassium and

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,760
you have sodium that makes a good

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,039
electrolyte but you also have some

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,619
simple carbs from the honey and you have

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,160
some protein from the collagen all

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,599
together it makes this the superior

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,220
electrolyte Elixir now you could make

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,300
something similar by using these Made

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,880
For You packets from lmnt it's fine but

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,379
it is kind of expensive and I do use

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,180
them but it's up to you if you want to

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,399
use that or not so first you have your

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,399
water and I hope you're using an RO

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,840
filter I hope you're using a distiller I

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,360
hope you're using at least a charcoal

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,920
filter something to purify your water

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,660
because you should not be drinking the

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,140
water straight from your TAP so you take

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,719
your water take some magnesium malate

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,460
it'll come with a spoon and you just

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,739
want to use half of the spoon which they

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,780
give you so it's about half of a

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,479
tablespoon just a little bit of

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
magnesium melon Just A Pinch maybe a big

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,640
pinch but you know I mean

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,400
then we have sodium chloride which is

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,020
just your regular table salt I have pink

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,299
salt you can use any salt doesn't really

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,420
matter so long as it's sodium chloride

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,740
half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,400
sodium chloride

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,140
and then you have potassium citrate this

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,640
one you're going to use less of so not

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,520
even half a teaspoon you're going to use

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
one quarter of a teaspoon and even the

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,000
spoon which they give you is really

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,600
small so if I use use the spinach they

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,979
gave me so one small thing of potassium

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,799
citrate

45
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,380
so three ions and the ratio which I Told

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,720
You So sodium chloride magnesium malate

47
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,240
can be about the same and a little bit

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,579
less about half of those quantities for

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,140
the potassium citrate and that's a solid

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,720
electrolyte Foundation you can change

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,399
these ratios depending on what you need

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,380
but that's a more heavy topic which I

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,700
don't really need to go into this is a

54
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,099
solid electrolyte when you're starting

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,020
from scratch this is perfect you don't

56
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,420
need to overthink it and then we have of

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,099
course the collagen the collagen is an

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,080
interesting supplement it's definitely a

59
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,420
supplement which I recommend so collagen

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,040
is found in of course a lot of foods

61
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,720
chicken skins is a great source of

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,180
collagen any skin is a good source of

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,160
collagen because collagen is good for

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,099
your skin so collagen is one of the

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,020
primary proteins which make up our skin

66
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,020
so the more collagen you have in your

67
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,480
skin the more healthy more Vitality more

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,400
glow you'll have in your skin so this is

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
easy to drink it's just like water just

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
like water with salt but it has also

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,900
some protein so if I am not able to make

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
my esoteric eggnog Elixir which is

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,500
superior to this to be fair because it

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
has healthy fats as well the esoteric

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,940
eggnog Elixir takes time to make though

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,560
don't be afraid of carbs my guys I know

77
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,900
the keto Community has kind of

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,760
criminalized eating carbs it's the

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,340
refined carbs and the high fructose corn

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,680
syrups which mess you up not all carbs

81
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,980
are bad like honey is great I'll just

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,620
add half a tablespoon of honey to my

83
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,420
electrolyte drink and I did Heat this

84
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,220
water so this water is room temperature

85
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,080
I put it for 30 seconds in the microwave

86
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,239
that's going to allow the salt and the

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Honey to dissolve in the water and the

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,280
collagen too and there we have it the

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,280
perfect the ultimate the esoteric

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
electrolyte elixir
