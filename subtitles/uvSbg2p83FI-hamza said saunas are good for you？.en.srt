1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,920
hey guys so I just watched uh hamza's

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,779
video on astrogenics it's a pretty good

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,179
introduction to the field of estrogenics

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,380
but some things he missed out or

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,460
something that I think could be

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,759
explained better

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
one thing he speaks about the sauna and

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,020
how the sauna has a great place to detox

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
that's true but it's not it's not

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,020
complete so when you're in the sauna

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,600
you're going to sweat out a lot of your

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,720
estrogenic mode from your fat cells but

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,359
you need to use a towel and wipe

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,859
yourself off constantly while you're in

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,960
the sauna and you need to wipe yourself

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,820
off completely before you leave the

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,440
sauna because those estrogenics are

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,239
still going to be in your sweat so if

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,899
you leave the sauna and your sweat dries

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,760
on you those estrogenics will just seep

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,860
back into your skin you don't get the

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,500
full benefit so you need to have a towel

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,879
when you create a sauna second thing

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,780
water

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,620
you need to have a metal water bottle

26
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,320
with you

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,760
in the sauna and drink water constantly

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
because your estrogenics will leave your

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,559
body not only from the sweat but also

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
through the urine so drink a lot of

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,100
water because your cells are going to be

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
agitated by the Heat and that's going to

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,299
release the estrogens into your well

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,640
into your blood and you know whatever

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,920
fluids in your body but you can only get

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,140
them out of your body when you urinate

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,720
or sweat so make sure you're drinking a

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,540
lot of water third thing and actually a

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,920
caution or dishonor the heat in the

40
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,140
sauna will actually kind of fry your

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,380
balls like you your sperm

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,020
will sometimes get damaged if you spend

43
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,220
too long in the sauna which is fine for

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,860
most people but if you're trying to have

45
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,200
a kid in the next 90 days you shouldn't

46
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,939
be using the sauna or if you are then

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,100
you always have a bottle of the cold

48
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,020
water and you just pour cold water on

49
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,380
your balls and keep them cold because

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,100
heat does destroy spermine that's one

51
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,619
thing

52
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,500
another thing he mentioned was uh

53
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,259
Omega-3s so oftentimes we'll get our

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Omega-3s through cod liver oil or fish

55
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,079
oil which is fine but

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,659
the oceans and rivers of the Earth are

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,280
polluted with estrogens and other things

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,080
like which are not even estrogenated

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,379
which are like heavy metals and Arsenic

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,239
and whatnot so when you're consuming cod

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,280
liver oil or any other fish oil or any

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,520
fish products that matter you need to

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,379
make sure it's from a clean source that

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
means you cannot buy the standard

65
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,300
omega-3 you know fish oil supplements

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,099
off the counter in your CVS those

67
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,660
probably will do more harm than good

68
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,840
because even though they contain the

69
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,720
Omega-3s they also contain estrogenics

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,819
so you need to do your research again

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,379
man it's all a matter of awareness and

72
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,780
understanding where your food supply is

73
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,560
coming from it's not simple that's why

74
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,560
this channel exists
