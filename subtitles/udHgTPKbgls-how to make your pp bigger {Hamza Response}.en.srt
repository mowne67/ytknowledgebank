1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
I can't believe Hamza has 400 000 guys

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,740
bopping their dicks that was the

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,480
fundamentals course this is the advanced

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,040
lesson not only that I'm going to show

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,200
you how to make the best omelet you've

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,700
ever made in your life just to outdo it

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
out compete what harms I did in his

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,020
video you see Hamza forgot to mention

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,480
hydration hydration gets your muscles

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,939
looking thick and juicy and same is true

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,460
also for your shaft grab a big glass of

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,420
water add some table salt to it and chug

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,779
it that's going to give you the

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,360
vascularity and I assure you that adds

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,520
greatly to her pleasure another huge

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,899
fundamental is getting sunlight early in

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,700
the morning when that early morning

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,559
sunlight hits your eyes it's going to

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,700
recharge your dopamine circuits and

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,520
that's going to make you much more

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,320
receptive to the kind of pleasure a

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,719
woman can bring you and of course that's

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,239
going to make you perform far better but

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
not only that not only that so when you

25
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,780
have sunlight exposure in the morning it

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
also activates your pineal gland which

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,440
is essentially your center of Sexual

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,199
Energy so sunlight in the morning is an

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,539
absolute non-negotiable said something

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,700
about eggs and absolutely he's correct

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,560
eggs are a fundamental to high

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,360
testosterone and high testosterone is a

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,159
huge factor of course in sexual

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
performance so here I'm going to show

35
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,979
you how to make the perfect egg omelette

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,200
which you're actually going to enjoy

37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,820
eating and actually enjoy making because

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,439
if you don't enjoy yourself while you're

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,580
cooking and eating you're not really

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,020
going to do it it's not going to be a

41
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,479
consistent habit for you in the long run

42
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,640
so first you need high quality eggs

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,700
what's a high quality egg it has to be

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,979
either free range or pasture raised why

45
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,140
is that it's because when you have hens

46
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,740
laying these eggs inside a coop instead

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,840
of building inside a closed environment

48
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,240
the hens don't have vitamin D so there's

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,180
no vitamin D in the eggs naturally right

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,979
you need the hens to be outdoors eating

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,200
insects and worms and whatever it is

52
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,060
that hens eat being exposed to sunlight

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,340
so that they can actually store that

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,619
vitamin D in their eggs which then you

55
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,720
can consume to obtain that vitamin D in

56
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,939
a bioavailable form so I got some

57
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,880
beautiful blue eggs right here with me

58
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,060
I'm going to break them and just look at

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,740
the color of that yolk that yolk is so

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,800
beautiful

61
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,599
nice orange deep color that shows you

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,060
that it's good quality eggs it doesn't

63
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,680
have to be that way there's eggs which

64
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,260
are yellow and they're still good

65
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,700
quality but this is what but this just

66
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,940
looks nice to me

67
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,220
then you go ahead and you beat them

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,480
and the more time you spend beating the

69
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,220
better and more smooth and consistent

70
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
your omelette is going to be I have to

71
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,819
tell you this which is very important

72
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,800
regarding your sexual performance

73
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,120
essentially is that you can have the

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
perfect diet you can have the perfect

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,680
sleep perfect everything and you might

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,120
still mess up because I haven't

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,160
discussed and even Hamza didn't really

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,780
discuss the biggest problem that you're

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,860
going to have especially if it's your

80
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,319
first time especially if you're not

81
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,239
experienced so you have to be very

82
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,860
Vigilant about your performance anxiety

83
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,120
and this is the make or break Factory

84
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,739
even more important than getting

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
sunlight in the morning which I consider

86
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,099
to be highly highly important so I'm

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,540
going to help you overcome performance

88
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,300
anxiety for the rest of your life

89
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,040
including your very first time but first

90
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,720
let me get this omelette started I'm

91
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,459
going to let my cast iron heat up a

92
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,739
little bit when I add some ghee onto it

93
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,840
ghee is a saturated fat highly stable

94
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,400
highly nutritious strongly recommend

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,319
ghee for cooking it's just as good as

96
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,120
butter if not even better than butter so

97
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,280
hamsa mentioned the importance of butter

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,739
why because butter is a saturated fat

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,900
just like ghee and the mainstream wisdom

100
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,659
is that saturated fats are bad for you

101
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,420
and polysaturated fats are good for you

102
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,040
this I believe to be wrong I believe

103
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,900
that saturated fats are actually the way

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,000
to go this is what our ancestor ate for

105
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,799
millions of years and had zero problems

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,299
with it until the modern day when

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,220
cardiac arrest and other diseases have

108
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,599
began to proliferate I find it hard to

109
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,459
believe that that which was working for

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,799
millions of years suddenly stopped

111
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,540
working so we have our ghee melting nice

112
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,860
and good I'm going to spread the ghee

113
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,080
out a little bit

114
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,700
so when you're in the bedroom or the

115
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,500
kitchen or the garage wherever you all

116
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,860
want to do it the thing which is going

117
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,260
to get you is the performance anxiety

118
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,140
I'm telling you right now that it's okay

119
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,940
not to perform during your first time or

120
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,060
even second or third time

121
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,280
is because you will have many many

122
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,739
opportunities my friend you'll have a

123
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,280
thousand hundred opportunities later in

124
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,380
your life to bang her brains out her or

125
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,000
some other girls brains out right so

126
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,040
don't stress it on your first time

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,979
you're literally inexperienced think

128
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,900
about it if you were told to make a

129
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,520
painting you think your first painting

130
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,759
would be your best painting or would it

131
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,320
even be a good painting obviously not in

132
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,000
no skill are we expected high

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,280
performance in the very first attempt

134
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,960
why is it that we have this extreme

135
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,220
pressure on ourselves when it comes to

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,860
sexual performance that we need to

137
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,860
perform from day one the first attempt

138
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,660
ever don't have this crazy performance

139
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,580
anxiety don't have this crazy pressure

140
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,500
on your head to perform that you have to

141
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,960
impress this girl and you have to do

142
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,880
perfectly the very first time you're not

143
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,020
going to succeed in that you're not you

144
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,880
don't have any experience you're not

145
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,800
going to be good at the first time

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
and you know what a lot of guys don't

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,380
understand

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,080
it's quite often that the girl is

149
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,380
actually more nervous than we are she's

150
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,780
even more afraid of her performance than

151
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,580
we ever are but the difference is you

152
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,560
know girls can kind of hide their

153
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,139
performance they can hide or you know

154
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,479
fake their orgasm we have to display

155
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,520
everything right our organism our

156
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,600
performance is very much visible so

157
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,460
perhaps there's a little bit more

158
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,100
performance anxiety because of that but

159
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,720
I assure you in her mind she's also

160
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,600
going crazy she's like you know can I

161
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,740
deliver pressure pleasure to this guy

162
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,660
can I

163
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,880
can I do my part can I make him happy

164
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,160
all these thoughts are going on in her

165
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,960
head far worse than it is going on with

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,660
your head so have some compassion for

167
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,840
her you know it's not a competition it's

168
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,979
not a fight it's literally sex

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,199
it's supposed to be one of the most

170
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,479
beautiful experiences a human being has

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,580
and if you don't perform you know what

172
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,199
the sun is still gonna rise you're still

173
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,240
gonna be okay the world is going to

174
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,460
continue it's not the end of your life

175
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,440
trust me I know the feeling I was a

176
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,539
young idiot once too right I was going

177
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,520
out with a beautiful Brazilian

178
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,560
volleyball player at the time and I got

179
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,900
this terrible terrible advice from

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,820
literally The Men's Health Magazine it

181
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,440
said something along the lines of you

182
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,060
need to bust a nut essentially you need

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
to masturbate before you have sex so

184
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,759
that you last longer this is utter

185
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,039
garbage watching porn or masturbation

186
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,960
destroys your sexual energy and you

187
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,479
won't be able to actually get hard and

188
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,699
perform with an actual female real human

189
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,800
being woman if you engage in those kind

190
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,720
of activities so literally my very first

191
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,880
time with this beautiful Brazilian chick

192
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,979
who is actually a nuclear physicist

193
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,840
right now it's kind of crazy so I had

194
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,300
taken this bad advice and not only that

195
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,280
this girl was making a Brazilian drink

196
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,539
called a caipirinya or something like I

197
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,960
know how to pronounce it right but like

198
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,300
this Brazilian drink and you know I

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
wasn't anxious I was nervous so I had

200
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,560
one too many drinks and alcohol is

201
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
terrible for boners I assure you like if

202
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,520
you have alcohol the chance of you

203
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,039
getting a proper boner diminishes

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,380
rapidly so I had taken that bad Men's

205
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,620
Health advice I was already anxious and

206
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,240
nervous plus I was having alcohol so you

207
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,500
know it was already game over for me I

208
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,759
mean I know that in retrospect there's

209
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,800
already a game over for me but I didn't

210
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,479
know it at the time so I couldn't

211
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,039
perform I'm not going to go into the

212
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,900
Gory details because I don't even want

213
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,000
to go back there in my even in my

214
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,979
memories right and

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,500
you know it was a disappointing and

216
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:34,560
painful night however

217
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,620
are still in the game the next morning

218
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,020
you see the sun is your ally the next

219
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,479
morning well it wasn't just the sun

220
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,940
which was Rising let's just say she

221
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,400
definitely got it she was yelling in

222
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,199
Portuguese and everything so I succeeded

223
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,020
in the end but trust me when I tell you

224
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
I know the pain of bad performance I

225
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,560
hope it doesn't happen to you but if it

226
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
does it's fine you can joke about it

227
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,979
later hell me and that girl actually

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,139
joked about it later like a couple weeks

229
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,840
later well she joked about it to be

230
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,340
honest me in my head like I was laughing

231
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400
but in my head I was like you know sharp

232
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,199
bit and you know it was a fun time but I

233
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,360
just want to alleviate your performance

234
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,099
anxiety it's not that serious but on a

235
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,500
more serious note here's the omelet

236
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,940
almost coming up

237
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,680
um it's got a little bit stuck to the

238
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,780
pan this happens if your pan isn't hot

239
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,460
enough to begin with like I said this

240
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,919
stove is kind of [ __ ] so my omelette is

241
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,440
not perfect it is what it is I have to

242
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,319
tell you something more serious though

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,380
so porn addiction this is gonna mess you

244
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,240
up in a big way because

245
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,060
porn affects your dopamine system it

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,760
affects your prefrontal cortex which is

247
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,919
the center of stoicism in your body and

248
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,300
your brain it's not the perfect omelette

249
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,120
but man is better than what hamzo is

250
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,940
having so I'll call it a win and so you

251
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,420
have your omelette it's all really nice

252
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,580
and made it has the ghee texture it has

253
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:01,260
a ghee flavor what I'm gonna do is put

254
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,480
this aside and cut my piece of bread

255
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,519
regarding porn addiction right you

256
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,220
obviously want to break free from that

257
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
and I'm going to be making a video about

258
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,940
this very topic I already made it

259
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,160
actually it just needs to be edited and

260
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,720
this video is so good that I will

261
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,339
actually make you a personal promise

262
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,160
that video is coming out in a couple of

263
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,800
weeks if you watch that video you will

264
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,600
break free from your porn addiction for

265
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
the rest of your life I literally

266
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,440
explained step by step exactly what you

267
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,720
need to do to break the addiction so

268
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,820
watch out for that video

269
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,240
meanwhile we have our breakfast almost

270
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,300
ready I have my Italian bread I have my

271
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,140
omelette cooked in ghee and of course I

272
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,240
have a piece of nice dark chocolate this

273
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,060
is 85 cocoa

274
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,060
dark chocolate and I will pour myself a

275
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,580
little bit of olive oil a little bit on

276
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,580
the Omelette itself and a little bit on

277
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,640
the side olive oil is a mono unsaturated

278
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,320
fatty acid so it's not as stable as your

279
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,540
ghee it's not as stable as butter but

280
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,459
still plenty Stables it's very healthy

281
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,959
olive oil is been used for thousands of

282
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,839
years right so nothing surprising there

283
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,240
far more healthy than your seed oils

284
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,180
and here we have it perfect breakfast

285
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,860
you don't have to have breakfast I like

286
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,660
breakfast so I have it it's pretty light

287
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,060
breakfast so it works for me find out

288
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,060
