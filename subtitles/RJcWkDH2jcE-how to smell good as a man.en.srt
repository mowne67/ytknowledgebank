1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
if women had evolved to do anything it

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,799
is to be able to detect the quality of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,400
their mate at the deepest genetic and

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,000
biological levels and they do this using

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,000
smell and in this video I'm going to

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,519
answer the question do human pheromones

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
exist what does that mean for dating

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,960
life and sex in general I'm going to

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
tell you which colognes are toxic to

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,600
your hormones and why you might smell

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
bad to others even if you shower every

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,080
day and can't really notice any bad

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
smells yourself see the thing is people

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,560
are usually too nice to comment on

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,759
anything people are too nice to let you

16
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,680
know so I'm also going to give you a

17
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,800
technique to find out if you smell bad

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,760
without asking anybody so the tears

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,160
right a tears of a crying woman can

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,680
literally reduce free testosterone in

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,640
men lower sexual aggression and make

22
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,039
them more pacified that's chemical

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,760
warfare but also works the other way the

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,840
scent of a man can actually pacify a

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,120
woman the scent of a man can lower her

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,960
stress give her feelings of well-being

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,800
so they did this experiment it's very

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,199
easy to show that women actually feel a

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,640
sense of calm when exposed to the sense

30
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,799
of a man healthy women have the ability

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,200
to sense Health in men and when I speak

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,600
of Health I'm talking about hormonal

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
health so the balance between cortisol

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,080
and testosterone if you're a highly

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
stressed unhealthy male you're not going

36
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,840
to be attractive even if you have good

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,200
facial Aesthetics because you're going

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,240
to be emitting smells and pheromones

39
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,960
that convey your low status I want you

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
to imagine a version of you who's

41
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,320
hormonally healthy who's mastered his

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,360
social skills and he's optimized his

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
looks if you do all three of these then

44
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,479
you're going to be golden so most people

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,119
don't know this but looks money and

46
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,640
status the Holy Trinity of the red pill

47
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,240
is just a surface approximation of the

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,640
real underlying biology these red pill

49
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,439
dorks they think they're so clever and

50
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,880
wise for figuring out that women care

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,560
about money looks and status of course

52
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,520
they care about these things what's so

53
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,320
special about that you could ask any

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,640
Village Bumpkin in any civilization any

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,240
random mud hut tribe across history in

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,840
any part of the globe and they will tell

57
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,360
you the same thing there's nothing

58
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,360
surprising about the fact that women go

59
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,880
for looks money and status if you really

60
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
want to dig deep into human nature

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,719
including male and female nature and

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,000
interex interactions I suggest you read

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,720
a book called the Red Queen by Matt

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Ridley I spent more than $1,000 on

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,440
cologne complete waste of time you may

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,280
not know anything about fragrances right

67
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,720
but there's actually a huge community on

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,760
YouTube they call themselves The

69
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,160
fragrance community so first you buy

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,760
your first colog you think it's your

71
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,200
signature scent I had something called

72
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,200
the Chanel alure ediion Blan and this is

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
actually a very rare fragrance it smells

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,280
like key line pie and it's really nice

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,720
but then I needed a summer fragrance so

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,599
I got myself mugir Ultra zest which is

77
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,599
another highly cetted fragrance and this

78
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,319
one smells like orange creamsicle and

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,800
for dates I got myself some Creed

80
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,640
aventus which is a super expensive but

81
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,040
really good smelling fragrance smells

82
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,440
like musky pineapple almost and women do

83
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,920
really like this but this wasn't

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,840
suitable for the workplace so I got

85
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,519
myself some Prada LOM which is like kind

86
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,120
of like a sophisticated Iris smell which

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,480
is still very alluring but it's more

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,440
like professional I also had a molecule

89
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,159
over one which is a magic scent like it

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,200
smells different on each person like I

91
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,480
had spent hundreds of dollars per bottle

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
on this stuff so I know what the hell

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm talking about and I tell you with

94
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,680
some amount of pain that all of these

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
are incredibly toxic these are chemicals

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
which should not come in contact with

97
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,519
the human skin if you look at the

98
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
ingredient list of any of these colognes

99
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,159
you will not be happy with what you see

100
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
for example Dior saage which is a very

101
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,120
famous fragrance it literally contains

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,680
red four I don't know what purpose and

103
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,920
all fragrances all Colones contain

104
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,080
benzophenones on or other photo blockers

105
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,560
and the reason this is important is

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
because the smells come from aromatic

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
chemicals and aromatic Rings they tend

108
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,000
to break down with heat or light and

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,599
because of this the manufacturers have

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,799
to add photo blockers in order to kind

111
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,640
of protect these sensitive chemicals

112
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,439
from denaturing because if they denature

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,400
then the smell is going to smell bad but

114
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,799
these benzo phenos other photo blockers

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
are endocrine disrupting which means

116
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,120
that they tank your hormones so now

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,159
you're in a awkward spot you're using

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
those cologn to smell good to women but

119
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,079
these cologn are decreasing your hormone

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
levels and that's is going to make you

121
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,640
less appealing to women so it's very

122
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,799
counterproductive so are all colognes

123
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,319
trash well all designer colognes are

124
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,480
trash yes but I'm going to give you some

125
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,799
recommendations and what you can

126
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,280
actually

127
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,599
use we care about the pheromones between

128
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,919
man and woman the first Topic in here is

129
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,359
imprinting so a woman who's parab bonded

130
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,160
to a man can detect which clothing

131
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
belongs to him using fermon alone so

132
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
they literally take T-shirts from like

133
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
group of men and they wash them again

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,880
and again until all smell is destroyed

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,960
and they give it to women and the women

136
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,639
can smell a t-shirt they don't smell any

137
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,080
smell so they they say it to the

138
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,479
investigators like I don't smell

139
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,520
anything but I feel like this t-shirt

140
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,680
belongs to my husband or boyfriend so

141
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
even if it's not at a cognizant level

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
there is chemical signaling at the

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,440
subconscious level how do you know if a

144
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
woman finds your scent attractive the

145
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,960
simple answer she will tell you it

146
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,800
happens all the time women love talking

147
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,120
and they will straight up tell you once

148
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,720
they have enough confidence once they

149
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
have enough warmth developed towards you

150
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,000
they will be very open with you but if

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,800
you have never gotten a compliment like

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,800
that then we have to evaluate first

153
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,039
maybe you don't smell good good because

154
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,039
I'm going to give you the protocol to

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
fix that problem and the second maybe

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
you're not that attractive that's fine

157
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,759
I'm going to make a full looks maxing

158
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,039
guide in the future look out for

159
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,600
that so here we go boys actionable step

160
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,360
the smell maxing protocol here we go so

161
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
first one is your environment so

162
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,440
literally your home and people

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
completely don't understand how

164
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,120
important the smell of your home is

165
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
because these smells basically adhere to

166
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
your skin and your clothes and you will

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
never detect it because you're used to

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,360
smell of your home but others absolutely

169
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,000
can so you have to maintain cleanliness

170
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,000
in your home you're going to wash your

171
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,199
bed sheets pillow covers and all the

172
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,880
bedding at least once a week because as

173
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
you sleep you're leaving your know dead

174
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
skin cells and these will rot and cause

175
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
smell and you'll never smell it but

176
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,600
those smells will stick to you as you go

177
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,759
about your day so your bed covers bed

178
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,800
clothes all that stuff needs to be

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,680
washed every week for sure the next item

180
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,560
is food what you eat absolutely has a

181
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,759
massive impact on what you smell like

182
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,280
spices will absolutely be metabolized

183
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,639
and then just sweat it out from your

184
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,280
skin this is not a myth this is fat and

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,680
you can prove it all my Indian Brothers

186
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,880
will know of Maggie like every single

187
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
Indian knows what Maggie is Maggie is a

188
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,720
spicy noodle dish and it has it's really

189
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,080
tasty but it has a strong smell of Rich

190
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,120
spices and if you eat Maggie you're

191
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,639
going to smell like metabolized Maggie

192
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,039
for 24 hours 100% guaranteed so be aware

193
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
of what you're putting into your body

194
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,120
because that can cause smell for sure

195
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm going to show you how to evaluate

196
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
that but before that we're going to go

197
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,080
to another example so probably nobody

198
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,039
has had true organic bacon from a

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,639
healthy Pig so 100% of bacon store Bo

200
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,919
bacon is coming from castrated pigs so

201
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,440
they take these pigs and they brutally

202
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,840
they snippet balls man they snippet

203
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
balls and they do this for a very

204
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,520
specific reason pigs which have their

205
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,560
balls and therefore have testosterone

206
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
their meat literally smells different

207
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,400
and I know this I've literally

208
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,440
experienced this and it even has a name

209
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,639
it's called bore taint you can look this

210
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,479
up right now so basically if you have a

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,680
intact Pig like a healthy Pig which

212
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,080
actually has its balls its meat will be

213
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,560
infused with kind of an animalistic odor

214
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,319
like a very animalistic and almost kind

215
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,759
of like sweat it's not a very pleasant

216
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,039
smell and if you eat organic bacon which

217
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
has that smell then you will emit those

218
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,879
very smells and here's the thing this

219
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,240
has nothing to do with hygiene as such

220
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,280
you could be showering every day you

221
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,520
could still smell bad purely because of

222
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,160
the diet and how do you evaluate this

223
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,280
here's one way so take a shower be as

224
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,840
clean as possible and then go into the

225
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,039
sauna and spend 15 minutes in there and

226
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,560
after 15 minutes if you can smell

227
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,520
yourself

228
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,199
uhoh stinky this means that this is not

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
just a skin level or Surface level smell

230
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,759
this is coming from your metabolism now

231
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,840
this could be very easily fixable maybe

232
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
it's just diet maybe you're just having

233
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,560
a lot of spices but potentially it could

234
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,400
also be something else it could be a

235
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,879
sign of bad metabolic Health it could be

236
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,280
a sign of bad gut health it could be a

237
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,840
sign of parasitic load but then again

238
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,000
parasites are a topic for a different

239
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
discussion so what's the shower protocol

240
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,159
obviously I've been saying this for a

241
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
long time Tallow soap is the best soap

242
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,560
that you can have it's very gentle

243
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
however if you have acne you want to be

244
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
using sulfur soap sulfur soap will

245
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,159
destroy acne but you don't want to use

246
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
it permanently I I would switch out of

247
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,560
sulfur soap and go to Tallow soap as

248
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,080
soon as the acne clears up and then for

249
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,080
hair so hair is actually a place where

250
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,720
you can store a lot of bad smell so i'

251
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,360
strongly recommend using shikakai

252
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,599
powders so it's a herbal powder so

253
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,360
basically you take it put it into a bowl

254
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,280
add some water and make a paste out of

255
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,120
it and that paste will act as shampoo

256
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,200
and it it will lit foam up and act

257
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,279
exactly like shampoo without destroying

258
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,159
your scalp so as you know shampoo is

259
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,240
mostly a scam it purposely makes your

260
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
scalp dry so that you produce

261
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,200
overproduce oils and then you need more

262
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,680
shampoo to fix that problem so shampoo

263
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,399
is trash try to use shikakai powder

264
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,040
instead and finally of course get a

265
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,720
shower filter it's good for your skin

266
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,160
removes the chlorine from the water the

267
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,040
chlorine kills skin cells and dead skin

268
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,480
cells can Decay and cause smell so I

269
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
wouldn't be surprised if switching to a

270
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,519
shower filter would actually reduce body

271
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,079
odor and then deodorant what deodorant

272
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
should you use I use a magnesium based

273
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,279
deodorant and I'll link to the one which

274
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,399
I use in description below and then what

275
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,320
about oral hygiene obviously you want to

276
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,240
maintain good oral hygiene you don't

277
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,360
have bad breath and don't of course buy

278
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,120
into your lisine propaganda lisine is a

279
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,600
scam product from day one it purposely

280
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
dries out your mouth so that your body

281
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,120
doesn't have enough saliva saliva can

282
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,880
actually kill germs and so blisterin

283
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,480
actually causes bad breath it literally

284
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,399
causes the problem designed for it to

285
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,320
solve hello then we discovered that a

286
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
daily garle Listerine antiseptic

287
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,519
mouthwash deals with the germs that can

288
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,880
cause bad breath hello man the guys at

289
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,320
propor and gamble are actually Geniuses

290
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,440
they're just Evil Geniuses so when it

291
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,720
comes to oral health flossing is a must

292
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
every single day at night Second Use the

293
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,680
right toothbrush change out your

294
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,079
toothbrush every month use an Ultra Soft

295
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,640
bristle toothbrush in fact get a kitty

296
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,959
brush you know like the brushes which

297
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,680
they make for babies extra soft that's

298
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,160
what I use literally and third what kind

299
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
of toothpaste should you use I always

300
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,640
always go for a non- floridated

301
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,360
toothpaste currently I'm using a hydroxy

302
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,880
appetite powder I will link to that as

303
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,920
well in the description hey boys so I

304
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,680
actually forgot to mention this the

305
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,519
first time I recorded this video so I

306
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,720
had to like make the segment separately

307
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,640
because it's that important so this is a

308
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
tongue scraper if your tongue is always

309
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,079
white then you definitely need to be

310
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,320
using this and lastly gut health so you

311
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,839
could have the perfect mouth hygiene but

312
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,880
you could still have bad breath if you

313
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,839
have bad gut health and of course gut

314
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,360
health is a vast topic onto itself it

315
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,839
doesn't really fit neatly into this

316
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,680
video I do include a whole section on

317
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,160
gut health in my esoteric nutrition

318
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,240
course if you are so inclined you can

319
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,240
check that out in the description

320
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,639
below and you will know that there's a

321
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,720
lot of fragrances which purport to be

322
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,480
human pheromone fragrances I think it's

323
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
all Bs and I wouldn't personally use

324
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
them I wouldn't use them because why

325
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,240
would I put an artificial pheromone on

326
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
myself to make myself attractive to

327
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,800
women I would much rather focus on my

328
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,680
own health and my own genuine

329
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,000
testosterone levels in order to become

330
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,480
genuinely more attractive rather than

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,680
have these Band-Aid these quick fixes is

332
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,200
instead just focus on good hygiene which

333
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,079
I've already described and also focus on

334
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,240
getting good colognes which smell really

335
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,040
nice and have an attracting factor to

336
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,360
them without purporting to be human

337
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,560
pheromones so as I've said before a lot

338
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,839
of cologne is toxic don't use toxic

339
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,360
colognes here's the Alternatives instead

340
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,079
and essential oil blends are exactly

341
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,760
what they sound like they are basically

342
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,959
a combination of extracted Aroma

343
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,000
chemicals from plants so some companies

344
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,120
have made really creative Blends by

345
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,760
mixing different Aromas so essentially

346
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,839
this is perfume is just not perfume how

347
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,279
we understand it as modern people we

348
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,600
understand cologne and perfume as to be

349
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,760
those big bottles with the alcohol

350
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,519
sprayer but in ancient times this is

351
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,959
what they used as perfume or cologne

352
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,440
essentially nothing more and nothing

353
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,639
less than a distillation of plant

354
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,160
Essence so truly speaking in ancient

355
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,240
times this is what the Nobles and rich

356
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,000
people and kings and ambassadors would

357
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,440
have actually used so I consider using

358
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
these to be almost like a status symbol

359
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,519
man these are really cool so two in

360
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,639
specific are interesting to me one is

361
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,720
called egyp Egyptian gold and what in is

362
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,240
called chivalry and both of these are by

363
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,920
a company called Young Living first we

364
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,880
have chivalry which is a kind of a

365
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,839
daytime or summary scent really

366
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,560
beautiful and the name really does do it

367
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,160
justice so it even has a little like um

368
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,399
a night riding on a horse symbol on it

369
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,320
so the scent is kind of like flowers but

370
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,240
without being gay or feminine plus bark

371
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,519
and wood plus kind of citrus smell so a

372
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,880
little bit of flowers a little bit of

373
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,800
Woody smells plus a little bit of citrus

374
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,760
and that's what this basically is it's

375
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,240
really nice very crowd-pleasing very

376
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
nice for daytime very nice for summer

377
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,720
and spring this is the opposite this is

378
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,959
Egyptian gold this is a dark

379
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,079
frankincense and myrr smell so I

380
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,160
completely see what they're going with

381
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,880
the naming scheme here an Egyptian gold

382
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,279
does do it justice it's very like a

383
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,600
mystical and mysterious and dark smell I

384
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,440
think this would be really nice for

385
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,959
winter or nighttime I would definitely

386
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,440
wear this on a date it's that kind of

387
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,240
smell you know kind of mysterious Vibes

388
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,839
while this is kind of more like a first

389
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,519
impressions

390
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,639
vibe so if you're already doing 80 to

391
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,839
90% of this protocol and you're still

392
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,320
facing body odor then there could be an

393
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,880
underlying issue you see the skin is a

394
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,040
detox organ it's always garbage in

395
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,519
garbage out and the modern world is full

396
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,120
of modern toxins we're talking about

397
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
xenoestrogens we're talking about heavy

398
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,760
metal toxicity we're talking about

399
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,079
microplastics and perhaps the most

400
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,760
relevant for this topic is just chronic

401
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,839
stress it is not normal for you as a

402
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
human being to be facing cortisol

403
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,600
inducing spikes throughout the day and

404
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
you can test this out for yourself think

405
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
about the stressed people in your life

406
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,399
don't they smell worse and even yourself

407
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
in times of stress Don't you smell worse

408
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
of course you do so you need to combat

409
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
chronic stress in your life and one way

410
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
to combat chronic stress is through

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,800
breathing exercises which are linked to

412
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,600
below and speaking of these modern

413
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,720
toxins as well as the ancient enemies of

414
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,839
mold toxicity and parasitic load all of

415
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,680
this applies directly to me because for

416
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
the past 1 month I've been in India and

417
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,240
I've been there to learn meditation but

418
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
the problem problem is in India I didn't

419
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,759
have access to RO water I didn't have

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
access to a shower filter and

421
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,560
practically all the food I consumed was

422
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,519
cooked in seed oils and I did eat street

423
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,199
food which obviously has the risk of

424
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,600
parasitic contamination so I personally

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,399
will be looking at my own detox course

426
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
and following it and speaking about

427
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,199
parasites check this out this is

428
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Ivermectin belonging to the atin class

429
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,639
of antihelmintics there is also of

430
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,079
course the benzimidazol class of

431
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,759
antihelmintics like albendazol if you're

432
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,639
in my private Community you already have

433
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,920
access to one of the best herbal

434
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,279
parasite Purge protocols on the planet

435
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,600
and in about a month or so you're going

436
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,360
to have a new module added to the detox

437
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,519
course for the pharmaceutical option the

438
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,000
pharmaceutical parasite Purge also I'm

439
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,519
going to be adding a new module into the

440
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,959
nutrition course I'm going to be adding

441
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,959
a mini gut reset protocol because I

442
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,199
understand that a month-long gut reset

443
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,600
protocol is unrealistic for most people

444
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,440
if you're interested in these modules

445
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,279
they're just a small part of these

446
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,440
courses which I have in my private

447
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:04,160
community if you are so inclined you can

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,160
