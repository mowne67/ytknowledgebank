1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,979
one two please

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,619
when the media came for Hillary

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,020
you're under arrest it hurt her her

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,779
credibility with her base was destroyed

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,420
or at least weakened however when it

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,980
came to Donald Trump China China

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,460
the media could say whatever they wanted

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,740
but he would actually gain from it Trump

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,260
would actually get stronger when the

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,280
media attacked him Trump was

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,540
anti-fragile and Hillary was fragile

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,020
let's look at Damocles you see Damocles

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,260
was a hero or at least a character in

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,840
Greek mythology and he accepted

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,219
the Throne of his kingdom under the

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,820
condition

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,800
that a sword be suspended

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,140
over his head

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,979
and the sword was suspended by a single

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,140
length of horse hair

21
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,760
you see the slightest shock

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,119
and that sword will come crashing down

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,820
on his head and democles was

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,240
democles was fragile

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,939
and next we have the Phoenix you see

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,740
Phoenix is a mythical bird

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,700
what's so special about it is you can't

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,439
kill it

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,340
you can put the Phoenix through a wood

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
chipper and next dates back at work

31
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,060
you can put you can shoot the Phoenix in

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,500
the head in a couple hours you'll just

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,600
regenerate

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,159
but the Phoenix

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,579
never

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,560
gets any stronger so it's Phoenix it's a

37
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,759
robust system this is kind of fun

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,280
actually

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,399
shooting Outdoors instead inside yeah

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,220
I'm not going down this way I'll fall

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,100
guaranteed on a fragile system

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,200
all right down we go

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,860
next we're going to talk about

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,720
the learning Hydra the Hydra

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,740
the multi-headed beast from ancient

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,259
Greek mythology was what Hercules fought

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,660
so Hercules one of his tasks was to kill

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,340
the Hydra and when he was fighting it he

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,459
chopped off his head

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,980
but even shoved off that hydra's head

51
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,860
another grew into place

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,860
so the hydro is twice as strong

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,980
they cut off both heads another Hydra is

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,700
four times as strong cut off four heads

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,860
they have 16 heads 36 heads and every

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,260
time the Hydra was attacked it would go

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,900
stronger and stronger to the point even

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,720
the great Hercules could not fight the

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,239
Hydra so Hercules could no longer fight

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,500
with his strength he had to fight by

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,720
being strategic

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,980
which is something I highly Advocate on

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,980
this channel

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,400
Hercules decided to take

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,160
a burning hot sword a red hot sword

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,680
and then he would cauterize

67
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,540
this the next stumps of the Hydra so you

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,700
would cut off a hydra's head and then he

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,980
would burn it with that burning sword

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,540
and that would prevent it from growing a

71
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,800
new head

72
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,500
you see

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,159
Hercules to defeat the Hydra had to take

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,560
away the hydra's ability

75
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,500
to be anti-fragile he had to take away

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,239
the anti-fragile power of the Hydra in

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,739
order to win so at this point you might

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,780
be asking well why is this relevant to

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,540
you you're not Hercules you're not a

80
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,800
phoenix you're not Damocles how do you

81
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,040
become

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,940
anti-fragile well you already kind of

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
are

84
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,060
a healthy human being when he gets you

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,980
know the flu some other disease and

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,959
recovers from it would actually be

87
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,120
anti-fragile against it he'll be

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,000
stronger against that virus once he's

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,819
done recovering your immune system is an

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,220
example of an anti-fragile system the

91
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,200
next question is are your systems

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,120
fragile I've told you in a different

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,220
video that discipline is one part of

94
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,080
success but it's more important or at

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,299
least equally important to have success

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,940
systems in your life and these systems

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,980
need to be robust or even anti-fragile

98
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,720
so a common system which everybody on

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,299
YouTube always love to talk about is

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,459
monk mode you know the idea that you

101
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,260
give up a lot of things and you have to

102
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,600
make the sacrifices and be completely

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,520
disciplined for a couple months and

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,020
you'll find amazing success I have

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,419
nothing against monk mode but you have

106
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,400
to know that monk mode is a fragile

107
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,080
system when you break your discipline

108
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,759
you break your streak of Monk mode

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,139
immediately over your brain thinks you

110
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,300
know if you've already broken the streak

111
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,580
you've already messed up so you might as

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,979
well mess up more so what I find in monk

113
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,680
mode and also for my coaching clients is

114
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,479
they get on monk mode and then they mess

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
up you know they don't take their cold

116
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,160
shower one day or they go back to bad

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,540
habits like like porn or something I

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,740
mean once they've breached their

119
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,540
discipline

120
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,340
it becomes a Snowball Effect and they

121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,780
just keep breaching their discipline and

122
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,400
that way monkey will never actually

123
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,380
works for them

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,259
or and it didn't even work for me

125
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,419
because it relied on perfect discipline

126
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,100
which is fragile the slightest break in

127
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,900
your discipline is gone and then the

128
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,300
rest of the system doesn't work so I'm

129
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,100
not a huge fan of monkboard anymore I

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,620
think the better option is to have

131
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,720
habits and systems which understand that

132
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,180
you do make mistakes do have breaches

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,539
and discipline and still Propel you

134
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,979
towards future success do you hear

135
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,979
the tree creaking

136
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,320
I feel like that branch is going to fall

137
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,500
off anytime

138
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,419
and then we have people who can be

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,720
anti-fragile a great example is Jordan

140
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,919
Peterson you know the entire media

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,500
establishment the whole university

142
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,720
system came after him called him you

143
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,720
know racist and bigoted and homophobic

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,520
and this and that but in the end you

145
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,440
know he actually Rose from that and now

146
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,240
he's more popular than ever and more

147
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,039
credible than ever because he was able

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,680
to stand up to his opposition

149
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,580
so he I believe is an anti-fragile

150
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,220
person

151
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,600
and of course entire nations can be

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,880
anti-fragile

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
best example I can think of is the Roman

154
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,340
Republic after the Second Punic War so

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,620
Hannibal Barca the finest military

156
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,039
general of History

157
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,820
carthaginian General he took his army

158
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,000
with elephants and marched them from the

159
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,740
north of Italy through the Alps

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,819
in winter

161
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,319
and came into the Roman Republic

162
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,479
completely by surprise with this whole

163
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,539
Army and and he was such a good General

164
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,060
he would just destroy Roman armies left

165
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,180
right and center with an army half their

166
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,280
size and the Romans the Romans would you

167
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,319
know they won't give up Romans in that

168
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,900
time period they don't know how to give

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,199
up they would send Army after Army

170
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,720
against Hannibal parka and they would

171
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,699
lose they would lose 60 000 men 80 000

172
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,060
men they would lose a whole part of

173
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,500
their population just in a day

174
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,680
but you see

175
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,720
the Roman Republic not the Roman Empire

176
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,780
at least in his later stages was

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,940
anti-fragile the Roman Republic

178
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,500
eventually defeated the genius General

179
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,280
Hannibal

180
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,380
and came out stronger on the other side

181
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,960
destroyed the carthaginian empire

182
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,560
insulted their fields raised their lands

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,259
erased Carthage from the records and

184
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,020
then they created an Empire

185
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,599
twice as strong that's an example of an

186
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,419
anti-fragile Nation

187
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,039
we especially in the West

188
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:43,919
are not by any means anti-fragile

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,099
we are extremely fragile yes the West is

190
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:51,240
strong yes the United States is strong

191
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:52,560
however deep mistakes made at higher

192
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,120
levels

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,180
have cost the country to be fragile I

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,699
don't believe despite its strength the

195
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,380
U.S is as robust as it once was

196
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,060
that's a different topic for a different

197
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,919
day

198
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,440
and now let's talk about the most

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,699
anti-frasal one of them all your

200
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,340
favorite top G Andrew freaking

201
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,099
Tate the man has

202
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,259
sexual assault charges on him and even

203
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,240
then and very well it's not a support or

204
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,860
dismissal of him even then his

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,139
popularity

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,680
doesn't shrink it just keeps growing

207
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,440
Andrew Tate has created himself to be

208
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,200
anti-fragile to the media in another

209
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,820
video I describe my hypothesis that I

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,560
under Trade probably jailed himself

211
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,380
using the Romanian Authority's

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,779
corruption in order to get massive

213
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,620
popularity by being the highest profile

214
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:52,440
case of a man being wrongfully

215
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,600
imprisoned and now I see that there's a

216
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,339
rumor of him getting cancer and then he

217
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,740
puts on his Twitter that he doesn't have

218
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,680
cancer but think about that who does

219
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,959
that rumor actually benefit it benefits

220
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,180
State doesn't it the sympathy wave

221
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,800
created by Him whether he actually has

222
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,959
cancer or not I don't know you know the

223
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,980
sympathy wave created by this is to his

224
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,380
benefit

225
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,060
that's high level strategy if my

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,899
hypothesis is true

227
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,339
you see good strategy is the ultimate

228
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,980
superpower

229
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,620
it was true back in Roman times and it's

230
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,360
true today he'll always be true

231
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,899

help you oh and by the way I'm not

236
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,200
trying to take credit for coming up with

237
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,320
the concept of anti-fragility it was

238
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,940
actually by a mathematician Economist

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,839
very interesting person by the name of

240
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,720
Naseem Nicholas taleb and Talib he made

241
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
massive wealth in creating I believe it

242
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,620
is Forex Trading and then he decides to

243
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,820
be a mathematician and Economist and

244
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,140
comes up with this idea of

245
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,420
anti-fragility and among other

246
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,860
interesting ideas like ergodicity and

247
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,140
you can read more about it in his book

248
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,339
anti-fragility very interesting guy and

249
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,680
