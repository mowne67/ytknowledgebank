1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,680
is it even possible in the age of

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,759
denialism decadence and nihilism to see

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,559
a religious Awakening I'm going to walk

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,080
you through the history of religion in

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,480
the age of the internet to understand

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,400
the current Vibe shift and then we'll be

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,760
in a better position to predict exactly

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,199
what shape if any this new religious

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
Awakening will have here I'm speaking

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,560
only of the West and I'm taking the

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,160
position of an objective Outsider as I

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
was not born in the

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
west if you feel that Society feels

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,920
weird and wrong nowadays you are not

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,640
alone we live in the age of nihilism and

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,399
neoism you see it wasn't always like

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,160
this it accelerated with 911 911 was the

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,879
true vibe shift 911 was as important an

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,199
event to the destiny of mankind as was

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,399
the sack of Rome 911 was the key event

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,640
of the century and so much of the

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
current [ __ ] can be traced back to

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,559
that one afternoon 911 2001 marks the

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,720
end of the past Century and the

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,479
beginning of the neoo era 911 was

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,680
fundamental in shaping religion in the

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,600
millennial generation and of course it

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,720
was them who shaped the current ERA I

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,680
remember those events clear as day I

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,520
remember it because I was young right I

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,479
walked into my home after spending the

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,200
day Outdoors climbing trees and eating

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,720
berries my mother was crying looking at

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,720
the TV screen and I was confused I was

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
confused because bombings and Terror

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,360
attacks this kind of stuff happens in

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,759
the news and my mother had watched them

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,159
before without crying about it this time

39
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,600
it was different turns out my mother was

40
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,439
crying because she knew her brother my

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,280
uncle worked at the World Trade Center

42
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,600
even though I was very young I

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,479
understood that everything had changed

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,360
9/11 was a victory for the enemies of

45
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,560
the United States there's no question

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,439
about this if the goal was to destroy

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,920
the United States then they succeeded

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,360
the United States we live in now is not

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
the real United States I remember a time

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,439
where airports had no TSA security we

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,079
just grabbed boarding passes and just

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,520
walked to the gate and you'll see this

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,119
in movies like home alone you know old

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,000
movies which were shot before 2001 if

55
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,840
you read Edward snowden's account of 911

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,920
which every freedom loving man and women

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,599
should read you would see how the CIA

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,040
NSA and other governmental bodies

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,519
basically got unlimited power and zero

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
accountability after 911 the vile

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,840
abortion of the Patriot Act was born in

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,599
the fires of that Unholy day immediately

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,959
after 9111 there was a surge in

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,519
patriotism and Christianity and all of

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,599
America was United for one brief moment

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,720
in time 911 could have been the Catalyst

67
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,040
for a new golden age for America where

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,840
the ciens of the land were United in

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,000
purpose and Mission but this was not to

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,040
be the wars and the lies that came after

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,200
911 killed any trust in the United

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
States the United States that stood for

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,959
freedom and liberty was exchanged for a

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,440
surveillant state of disunity and

75
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:03,159
distrust this brings us few years later

76
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,280
to 2005 9/11 happened in 2001 2005 the

77
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,440
war was still raging in Afghanistan and

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Iraq but people had kind of moved on

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
with their lives and the internet became

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,200
a cultural Force for the first time

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
today it's easy to imagine that the

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
culture is shaped by the internet but at

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,560
the time it was actually unheard of the

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,599
internet had existed since the '90s but

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,840
it was a place for business activity

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,440
emails and porn but by 2005 there's

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
actually stuff to do for just normal

88
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,720
people online Internet speeds had gotten

89
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,760
to a point where video in at Mass scale

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,159
was finally possible and this was the

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,159
Golden Era of YouTube mid 2000s YouTube

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,519
was just a different kind of energy I

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,799
actually kind of feel bad for the young

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,519
guys who never got to see the true

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,760
potential of YouTube everybody right now

96
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,080
on YouTube is here to make videos to

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,959
make money about anything else video

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,519
sharing on YouTube is seen as lead

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840
generation for businesses but during

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,079
2005 nobody expected to make a single

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
dollar so all the biggest names at the

102
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,480
time were people who started uploading

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,400
for no reason other than than wanted to

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,439
make some videos I seek to emulate the

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,079
energy of this era I want to make videos

106
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,480
for a purpose greater than just making

107
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,079
money I want making money to be a side

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
effect of making videos this was the

109
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,840
first time when legit celebrities could

110
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,880
be created on YouTube this was the era

111
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,240
of PewDiePie and [ __ ] Higa there was

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Jenna Marbles and Philip def Franco

113
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Hamza was like 10 years old at the time

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,720
and Tate himself was 25 something like

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,720
that at the time there was two important

116
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,039
cultural movements that shaped early

117
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,680
YouTube the first was the pickup artist

118
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,080
movement which I spoke about in my

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
previous vide I'll be very brief about

120
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,560
it here but it's basically a bunch of

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,919
young guys realizing that everything

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,800
they thought they knew about girls was

123
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,080
just naive [ __ ] they used scientific

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,759
level analysis to get laid there was

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
Neil Strauss there was mystery there was

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,080
Tyler Duran that came into play that the

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,080
Genesis of the red pill comes from this

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,360
era Our dating vocabulary in comes from

129
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,560
this era we speak about things like lay

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,039
Count Day game look maxing approach

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,919
anxiety cold approach all this

132
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,160
terminology comes from that era and I

133
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,280
described this in the previous videos

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,639
I'm not going to go into it too much

135
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,240
here I will instead speak of the second

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,919
movement that shaped YouTube and this

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,080
was the more important cultural movement

138
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,560
it was called the new atheist movement

139
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,560
most people don't know this but there

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,479
was a concerted and vigorous attempt to

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,960
remove religion from internet culture

142
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,400
and indeed all of society this was the

143
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,919
new atheist movement of the mid 2000s

144
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
and to my eternal cringe I was a part of

145
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,240
this movement just as I was a part of

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
the Pua movement there was actually a

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
lot of crossover between these movements

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,479
the big difference was that this

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,520
movement was pioneered not by a bunch of

150
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,360
horny nerds but by actual scientists and

151
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,800
intellectuals we had Christopher

152
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,080
Hitchens a remarkable and Prussian

153
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,280
journalist who literally predicted the

154
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,280
deranged LGBT fueled feminism and the

155
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,120
transgender propaganda a decade before

156
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,240
it happened we had Sam Harris a super

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,000
sharp neurobiologist who tried to study

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,720
God and religion from a neurological

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,199
perspective we had Dan dennet a legit

160
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,880
philosopher and we had Richard Dawkins a

161
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,599
wonderful writer and an expert biologist

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,360
who literally coined the term Meme and

163
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,240
redefined the way genetics was

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,080
understood to this day these four were

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,840
called The Four Horsemen of the

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
Apocalypse or of atheism and they set

167
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,800
out with the express goal of demolishing

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,199
The Logical and moral underpinnings of

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,880
religion mostly Christianity why cuz 911

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,520
had stirred up religious fervor in the

171
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,160
US especially in the Bible Belt you know

172
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,960
Texas Georgia the Carolinas the big

173
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,039
churches in this region were pushing for

174
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
change in public education they wanted

175
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,440
to teach intelligent design in public

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,160
schools instead of evolution through

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,319
natural selection this of course created

178
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,960
conflict so what happened here was

179
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,800
Christopher Hitchens got into the fry

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,039
because he wanted to have separation of

181
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,759
church and state Dawkins got into it

182
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
because he was already a renowned

183
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,440
biologist and he saw intelligent design

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,160
as a bunch of nonsense the main points

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,560
of the new atheists were basically this

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,879
first religion is immoral because it

187
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,280
makes people do acts of great harm they

188
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,840
used 911 as the main example for this

189
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,560
they argued that without religion the

190
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
world would be a more peaceful place

191
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,960
second they said that religion did not

192
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
have sufficient scientific backing they

193
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,360
believed that anything that didn't have

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,080
sufficient science behind it should be

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,039
treated as unknown and Blind Faith had

196
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,840
no place in a thinking man's mind

197
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,720
and whatever your beliefs might be about

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,759
this The Four Horsemen of the new

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,520
atheist movement were excellent at

200
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,319
debate they were clear with their

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,080
beliefs they spoke with intelligence and

202
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,000
precision I'd go so far as to say that

203
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,479
they won every single debate they went

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,479
to they debated Catholics they debated

205
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,000
creationist Islamic thinkers they even

206
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,120
debated the new age spiritualist types

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,720
and they came out on top every single

208
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,560
time despite their unbroken string of

209
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Victories though you probably don't even

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,159
recognize these names at the tail end of

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,080
the movement around 2010 the new

212
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,680
atheists stood Victorious over their

213
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,639
enemies only to see that the arena was

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
empty by 2010 everything that was to be

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,159
said about the pros and cons about

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,479
religion had been said and people heard

217
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,000
every basic argument and had already

218
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,440
made up their minds as to which side

219
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,319
they belong to thousands of people had

220
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,360
moved away from religion under the

221
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,800
absolute Firepower of the new atheist

222
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,800
arguments and nobody could really debate

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,479
science and religion Again on YouTube

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,120
because everybody kind of knew where

225
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
that debate would eventually end up it

226
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,959
looked as though religion had finally

227
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,839
been logically defeated but something

228
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,839
new and funny happened so a new religion

229
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,839
emerged and hijacked the new atheist

230
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,720
movement it was the funniest cultural

231
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,600
shift i' had ever seen and to this day

232
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,279
the godforsaken social justice Warriors

233
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,760
took over new atheism you probably don't

234
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,600
even recognize that term because it's

235
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,680
fallen out of fashion but sjw social

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,920
justice Warrior was at at that time the

237
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,560
new Big Bad enemy suddenly the new

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,399
atheists and the religious folk found

239
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,279
themselves on the same side trying to

240
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,600
defeat this new monster that this

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
atheist had created now I am no atheist

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,399
now but I'm immensely grateful for the

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,680
cultural achievements of the new atheist

244
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,279
movement new atheists like Hitchens and

245
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,959
Dawkins combined the power of Greek

246
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,839
philosophy with the knowledge of modern

247
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,800
science the new atheist weren't bad

248
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,160
people they just chose The Wrong Enemy

249
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
they thought that the creationists and

250
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,480
the Christians were the enemy while

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,440
actually they were allies against the

252
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,040
NEOS socialists the new atheist stuff

253
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,120
kind of died down as gamergate took over

254
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,880
YouTube I briefly described gamergate in

255
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,240
my previous video but I will give you a

256
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,959
whole new angle into this gamergate was

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
the Scandal that rocked the gaming

258
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,600
industry the feminist sjws had slowly

259
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
crept up and infected the gaming media

260
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,760
outlets and they used their power to

261
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,160
attack men specifically straight white

262
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,680
men as being a bunch of rapists creeps

263
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,360
and misogynists so all nonsense of

264
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
course and it came to light later that

265
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
all these sexual harassment allegations

266
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,800
were just baseless lies for political

267
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,720
gain the meoo movement that came later

268
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,800
was actually a child of gamergate

269
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,680
naturally there was a reaction to the

270
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,760
sjws the supporters of the new atheist

271
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,120
movement became the first anti-feminists

272
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,120
of the gamergate era the perfect example

273
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,279
of this was Saron of fad and thunderfoot

274
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,720
they went from making anti-creationist

275
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,279
videos to making anti-feminist videos

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,519
they're already good they're already

277
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,160
practiced in logical thinking and debate

278
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,600
so they were able to crush the feminist

279
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
arguments it was like looking at a bunch

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
of toddlers breaking toys in fact the

281
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,160
debates of what it meant to be a man or

282
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,959
woman in this era laid the intellectual

283
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,760
foundations of the Hamza and Tate era

284
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,680
but the first objective was just to win

285
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,560
the culture war against the leftists the

286
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,560
science versus religion war was over and

287
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,920
The Gamers versus feminists War had

288
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,600
started but even this wouldn't last very

289
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,320
long gamergate happened in 2015 but

290
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,920
another cultural event a massively

291
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
important cultural event happened in

292
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,920
2016 so about a year later the brexit

293
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,519
referendum the brexit referendum was

294
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,360
basically the British people given a big

295
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,800
[ __ ] you to the European Union because

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,800
the EU was placing a lot of restrictions

297
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,880
on the British economy and was flooding

298
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,360
the British Isles with immigrants so

299
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,519
there was another cultural issue right a

300
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
bunch of Elites basically had decided

301
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
that Europe didn't belong to the

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
Europeans now that's a topic for a

303
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,440
different discussion but this changed

304
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,440
the face of YouTube yet again this was a

305
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,360
new war of globalists were populist this

306
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,600
was the same movement that pitted Trump

307
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,760
against Hillary in that same year the

308
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,320
great meme war of 2016 had begun Trump

309
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,079
was the populist and Hillary was the

310
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,600
globalist shill to be mocked funnily

311
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,079
enough brexit also marked the true and

312
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,279
Final End of the new atheist movement

313
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,240
Dawkins basically humiliated himself by

314
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
entering the cultural Arena on the

315
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,480
globalist side Dawkins was a biologist

316
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,480
so he didn't really understand why it

317
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,519
was that the Britains wanted to leave

318
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,000
the European Union so what happened was

319
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,120
brexit happened because the British

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
people were sick and tired of the dumb

321
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,079
EU regulations and mass enforced

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
immigration systemic destruction of the

323
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,040
British culture the British people voted

324
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,360
for independence from EU tyranny the

325
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,120
British people hoped for a resurgent and

326
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,440
vitalized Nation but of course looking

327
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,639
back from 2024 that clearly has not

328
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,560
happened Dawkins argued that the brexit

329
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,360
was a mistake and the referendum should

330
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,480
be ignored essentially the people's will

331
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,720
should be ignored Sargon of aad when and

332
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Dawkins were at odds for the first time

333
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,240
and Sargon crushed Dawkins in his videos

334
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,519
because Sargon understood politics

335
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,279
Dawkins understood biology the other

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,480
three Horsemen also retreated from the

337
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,839
field Sam Harris got tired of

338
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,600
controversy and he left Christopher

339
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,600
Hitchens got cancer and trien died Dan

340
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,760
dennet just faded away into Academia

341
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,920
where he always belonged across the

342
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,880
Atlantic in the US the meme factories

343
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,639
were open for business and the great

344
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,519
meme war of 2016 was fully underway in

345
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,760
the winter of 2016 Trump took the throne

346
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,480
but it wasn't the end of the culture War

347
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,040
the entire four years of the Trump

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,120
presidency was a period of great

349
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,959
cultural conflict the conflict was about

350
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
what it meant to be an American but is

351
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,519
also so much more the leftist try to

352
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,959
make Trump seem like this monster which

353
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,519
he clearly wasn't but it's actually

354
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,040
clearer now than ever that the Trump

355
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,199
years of presidency were actually some

356
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,480
years of peace and quiet compared to the

357
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,399
absolute [ __ ] show that is the Biden

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,199
presidency two groups had basically

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,120
formed in the years of conflict the pro

360
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,760
free speech pro- freedom broadly

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,880
right-wing Coalition and the opposite

362
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,079
was the pro- censorship Pro LGBT Pro

363
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,480
feminist leftwing Coalition so where did

364
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
religion come into all this I'll tell

365
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,320
you a new era of conflict started with

366
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
the introduction of Bill c16 in mid 2017

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,720
so not too long after the Trump

368
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,920
presidency had begun one unknown

369
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
Canadian Professor takes up a position

370
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,079
against the transgender agenda he's

371
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,360
smart articulate and very very well read

372
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,600
he looks at the government mandate to

373
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,560
use these transgender pronouns and says

374
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,360
I'm not doing it Jordan Peterson has

375
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,600
entered the scene and immediately causes

376
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,000
a huge Vibe shift the new atheists well

377
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,320
it's in the name they were obviously

378
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,160
atheists even the anti-feminists like

379
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,600
Sargon were at the time atheists but

380
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,240
Jordan Peterson he was the first

381
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,040
internet icon who is unquestionably

382
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,120
knowledgeable about science but was

383
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,600
sympathetic to religion he didn't think

384
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
Christianity was this darkid ideology

385
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,399
that should be buried at the end of the

386
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,440
century JP revitalized religion by

387
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
explaining the Bible in a new way he

388
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,800
used evolutionary biology and psychology

389
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,120
to explain ancient truths this was the

390
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,240
opposite of the new atheists the new

391
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,680
atheist had created a huge cultural Rift

392
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
between science and religion but Jordan

393
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,320
Peterson was kind of mending that Rift

394
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,519
he explained that the Bible was not a

395
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
book to be discarded but actually was a

396
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,480
part of the solution to the problems of

397
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
the Modern Age age on one side he fought

398
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,279
a brutal campaign against the leids for

399
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
free speech and individualism on the

400
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,320
other he provided a new Christian

401
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,519
framework for those looking for a

402
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,519
meaning in life recently huberman talks

403
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,279
about how he believes in God he was

404
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,199
asked about and he quotes the great

405
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,000
Heisenberg of the uncertainty principle

406
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:23,160
Fame he says the first gulp from the

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,519
glass of the Natural Sciences will turn

408
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,319
you into an atheist but at the bottom of

409
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,560
the glass God is waiting for you the

410
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,959
quote is basically is saying that if you

411
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,399
start learning science it seems

412
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,680
irrational to believe in a higher power

413
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,759
but as you learn more and more it just

414
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,519
doesn't feel that irrational anymore and

415
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,720
this has been my journey as well I was

416
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,759
an atheist in my first year of undergrad

417
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,040
as a bioengineer but by the end of

418
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,600
undergrad I was an agnostic a few years

419
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,160
into the PHD program and things changed

420
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,279
even more even the new atheists have

421
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,399
recently changed their minds recently

422
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,079
Dawkins talks about how he's a cultural

423
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,079
Christian he talks about how he loves

424
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,120
the cultural aspects of Christianity

425
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,079
loves Christmas carols and hymns and

426
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,920
Cathedrals and churches but here's the

427
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,800
thing you don't get Christmas without

428
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,319
Christ you cannot have your beautiful

429
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,079
architecture music poetry and art

430
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,399
without divine inspiration look at the

431
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,880
art and architecture made in the Godless

432
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,319
atheistic and modern world these are

433
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,360
artless and soulless Creations compared

434
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,560
to the works of men who are divinely

435
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,600
inspired I think the best argument

436
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,720
against the postmodern atheistic and

437
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,800
nihilistic worldview is not an argument

438
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
that put into words but rather can be

439
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,040
just seen and felt just look at the

440
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
differences in the artistic expressions

441
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,800
of these eras the fact that Dawkins now

442
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,319
supports Christianity which is hilarious

443
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,680
is a huge indicator of the current Vibe

444
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,720
shift I'll give you another example

445
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,920
which you'll actually recognize Jimmy

446
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,480
Jiang this guy is a great YouTuber he is

447
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,680
the king of Asian Riz he's made videos

448
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,079
about dating girls from practically

449
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,279
every country and even many porn stores

450
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,279
he was in the streets he was on the

451
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,480
streets and he was off the streets but

452
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,399
he recently quit and he tells in his

453
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,640
video why it's very good video and it's

454
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,720
very authentic he says simply he doesn't

455
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,799
want to be a [ __ ] everybody is

456
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,640
realizing that the headism of the past

457
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,280
years especially postco has not led to

458
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,600
any kind of lasting happiness in some

459
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,400
sense the Hedonism and materialism of

460
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,360
the Tate and Hamza era are a result of

461
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,319
our Collective loneliness and depression

462
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,240
during the

463
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,600
lockdowns now that that honic treadmill

464
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,080
has run its of course people are

465
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,480
realizing that the currency of Hedonism

466
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,480
is just plain old

467
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,240
nihilism to look ahead we must look back

468
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,360
the Renaissance was a blossoming of

469
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,039
culture like the world hadn't seen in

470
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,320
Generations the Renaissance was a fusion

471
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,880
of the Christian and the classical the

472
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,559
greatest minds of the generation saw

473
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
that they could harness classical

474
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,880
vitality and heroic energy and channel

475
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,640
it through Christianity I think this is

476
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,640
what is coming to the West I think the

477
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,120
normes will continue on the trajectory

478
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,840
of decline but a new and revitalized

479
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,080
spirit is coming to the intelligencia of

480
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,559
the West and you are in the absolute

481
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,600
Forefront of this shift in this video

482
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,880
I'm not going to try to change your

483
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,880
views on anything I have nothing to say

484
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,720
to those who are not already like me and

485
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,400
less do I care about convincing when I

486
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,440
mentioned gamergate and the war of the

487
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,000
feminists versus The Gamers I didn't

488
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,600
tell you who won the goddamn feminists

489
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,960
won look at all the gaming media outlets

490
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
right now nothing's really changed the

491
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,400
feminists not only kept their ground but

492
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,760
actually solidified their position I

493
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,000
look at the new atheist movement what

494
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,240
happened here The Atheist objectively

495
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,240
won every debate but there was no surge

496
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,640
in atheism just a surge in nihilism and

497
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
those with religious beliefs just kept

498
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,240
doing their own thing anyway and who won

499
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
brexit the populists might have won the

500
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,320
referendum and Trump might have won the

501
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
election but the main thing they wanted

502
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,120
to stop was mass immigration and the

503
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,120
collapse of their cultures but they

504
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,880
ultimately they fail to do so the great

505
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,440
immigration and cultural crises of the

506
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,280
West are now worse than they have ever

507
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,159
been right now I have friends in my unit

508
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,320
helping the Texas National Guard to

509
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,080
protect the Border they put up fences

510
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,760
but the feds just come and remove them

511
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,000
the next day the point is merely this

512
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,400
the side that has True Believers always

513
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,960
wins True Believers play the long game

514
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,440
True Believers will do whatever it takes

515
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,640
to ensure that they get what they want

516
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,679
debate and logic is useful but faith is

517
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,480
ultimately the more powerful force so

518
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,520
social justice warriors were True

519
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,960
Believers creationists were True

520
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,640
Believers the neoo are True Believers if

521
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,919
we stay on the current path the neoo

522
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
will Grind All virtue into dust they've

523
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,919
already destroyed the universities which

524
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,200
used to be a true beacon in the dark

525
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,200
they've destroyed the Public School

526
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,760
Systems which to be fair there's already

527
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,440
a s off they've destroyed the childhood

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,480
of so many young and Confused kids with

529
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,840
their poisons both mental and chemical

530
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,760
they are the enemies of Freedom Beauty

531
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,640
and achievement but they are not stupid

532
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,039
they're not lazy and they are at the

533
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,679
edge of victory for a good reason they

534
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,880
are more powerful than you think it is

535
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,720
not just a bunch of dumb kids in college

536
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
with blue hair speaking of which these

537
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,360
dumb kids do eventually enter the

538
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,360
workforce and saturate the HR

539
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,039
departments and HR is in charge of

540
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,960
hiring and firing decisions regardless

541
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,280
of the employees performance metrics it

542
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,000
is not just the media and Hollywood who

543
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,919
are guilty for the most egregious crimes

544
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,400
against women who will Point their dirty

545
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,320
fingers at the common man it is not just

546
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,200
the [ __ ] politicians who sell out to

547
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,280
the highest is bitter it is also the

548
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,240
bankers and the financiers who pull the

549
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,240
strings that truly matter so what will

550
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,919
happen now that is the question is it

551
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,159
not so let me lay it out to you my

552
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,039
argument piece by piece just like the

553
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,760
new atheists would first the West is

554
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,919
under existential threat from economic

555
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,400
collapse cultural dilution and unchecked

556
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,080
immigration second every time the West

557
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,000
has come close to collapse this has been

558
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,440
some kind of a defense mechanism that

559
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,679
kicks in to save the day if one and two

560
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,440
are true then we can expect that defense

561
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,000
mechanism to start forming very soon

562
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,679
question is what form will this take

563
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
will there be a return to Christianity

564
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,480
no not exactly because the kind of

565
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,120
Christianity that's taught in the

566
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,080
churches is the lamest most boring low

567
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,000
testosterone version of Christianity in

568
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,600
fact I consider this kind of

569
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Christianity would be a extension of

570
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,120
leftism think about it how many churches

571
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,760
have you seen with the rainbow flag

572
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,240
flying the Pope the head of Catholicism

573
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,200
washs the feet of Muslim immigrants the

574
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,400
type of Christianity that is all about

575
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,039
turning the cheek and to love their

576
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,080
neighbor is not what we need right now

577
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,279
the modern church has perverted these

578
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,880
teachings to mean that Christians should

579
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:41,600
just tolerate any humiliation and should

580
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,120
welcome unlimited immigration this is

581
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
the regime approved Christianity this is

582
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,960
the Christianity of the fat little

583
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Pastor or the nerd Theologian who rather

584
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,679
sit inside and read books rather than go

585
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,159
outside and experience the beauty of

586
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,960
creation this is the religious arm of

587
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,400
the

588
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
neoo this is not the only Christianity

589
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,559
there is however again we look to

590
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,679
history yes it is true that Christ said

591
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,320
turn the other cheek but how many cheeks

592
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,120
do you have you have two so basically a

593
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
two strikes and you're out policy the

594
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,600
first time you tolerate it the second

595
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,799
time you endure it but the third time it

596
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,120
is game over this is the form of

597
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,400
Christianity that will come to

598
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,279
Resurgence it will not appeal to the

599
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,799
masses but that's okay this is the type

600
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,799
of Christianity that will appeal only to

601
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,640
the intelligencia the intelligencia are

602
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,200
the young ambitious and intelligent

603
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,919
group of people both men and women who

604
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,039
will shape culture in the next next

605
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,400
decades in other words it is you this

606
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,039
vital Christianity is the most powerful

607
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,480
ideology that's ever been seen on the

608
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,039
face of this Earth this is the ideology

609
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,679
that that fueled the art and sculpture

610
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,679
of the Renaissance let me explain this

611
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,360
more clearly during the Renaissance the

612
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,400
greatest Minds did not just look towards

613
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,240
Christianity they looked to the

614
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,039
classical Pagan era for inspiration this

615
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,440
proved that it was possible to take the

616
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,640
heroic ideal and love for beauty that

617
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,600
the pagans had and combine it with the

618
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,320
structure of the church I should explain

619
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,880
what the word Pagan means it simply

620
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,320
refers to the pantheons of the Gods the

621
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,279
people believed in before Christianity

622
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,159
there are many flavors of this there was

623
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,480
the Roman Pantheon there was the Greek

624
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,159
pantheon there was the Norse pantheon

625
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,520
and of course there was the

626
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:22,120
Indo-European Pantheon Jupiter Zeus Odin

627
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,679
and Indra was the same deity nobody is

628
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,679
expecting anybody to start believing in

629
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,880
these old gods right but rather take the

630
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,240
love for adventure Beauty and expansion

631
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,000
from these culture

632
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,480
and nourished them within the Christian

633
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,080
framework the Renaissance was a

634
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,840
synthesis of classical thinking

635
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,279
Christian Frameworks and scientific

636
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,000
inquiry by combining the three you had

637
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,880
something that was more powerful than

638
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,360
any one of them would have been

639
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,480
independently Renaissance Men read

640
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,600
classical Works they read Virgil Plato

641
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,720
chis and Aristotle some of them were

642
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,600
intensely religious like B Chelly who

643
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,720
painted The Birth of Venus a pagan deity

644
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,320
Michelangelo painted or sculpted

645
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,559
classical figures that was commissioned

646
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,600
by the church itself and one must

647
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,000
remember that the Renaissance was not a

648
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,640
time of Peace it is not the case that a

649
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,159
bunch of painters and Poets could just

650
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,360
work on their art Carefree actually it

651
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,000
was a period of great technological

652
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,080
advancement especially in Warfare did

653
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,240
not DaVinci draw sketches for tanks and

654
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,480
helicopters Firearms became more than

655
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,840
just a niche armor-piercing weapon

656
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,240
culverin were invented a special kind of

657
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,159
long Cannon basically it would shatter

658
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,640
old fortifications so new kind of

659
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,919
castles had to be built and these were

660
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,200
called star Forts and they were designed

661
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,080
to specifically combat the new weapons

662
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
technology and I'll give even more

663
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,240
examples of this warlike and vital

664
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,760
Christianity think of the great

665
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,399
explorers of the age of sale I was in

666
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
Portugal last summer and I saw the

667
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:49,960
fruits of vital Christianity right in

668
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,799
front of me and even before that think

669
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,760
of the Reon Kista think of all of Spain

670
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,919
was taken over by invading forces and

671
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,880
Christendom looked lost but then a man

672
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,120
of great Vitality arose by the name of

673
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,440
elid and he pushed the foreign influence

674
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,799
out and ushered in a golden age for his

675
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,080
people some of the greatest warriors of

676
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,000
History were Christians the Templar

677
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,159
hosts the Portuguese teros tonic Knights

678
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,559
and the winged husars of Poland and even

679
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,480
before them the Legos of Byzantium did

680
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,039
not Justinian a Christian Emperor

681
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,480
command belisarius to take the catari

682
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,159
and bring Rome back into Christendom the

683
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,399
Christianity of the fat little Pastor in

684
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,760
your local church is not the only option

685
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:32,880
that you have think of Charles Martell

686
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,760
the hammer of France did he not crush

687
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,200
the invading Muslim forces despite being

688
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,880
outnumbered did he not do this deed in

689
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,760
the Name of Christ and Crown and in more

690
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,399
recent times the founding fathers of the

691
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,679
United States were literally the perfect

692
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,159
examples of whal Christianity they were

693
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,440
not fans of the old claustrophobic and

694
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,640
decaying churches of Europe and they

695
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,240
were certainly not enemies of

696
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Christianity they embraced the spirit of

697
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,320
expansion of the classical Greeks and

698
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,600
the Romans and they built great

699
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,080
architecture in the GRE style in fact

700
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
the founding fathers would perfect

701
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,679
examples of the Renaissance men they

702
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,120
were writers politicians leaders

703
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,279
scientists and warriors this is the

704
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,480
spirit that I want to see reawakened now

705
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,159
listening to this you might think well

706
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480
I'm not a Christian so what do I do well

707
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,320
firstly I'm not asking you to do

708
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,039
anything I'm making a prediction of

709
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,399
what's coming rather than a prescription

710
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,720
Christianity is the Bedrock of the West

711
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,440
not Islam not Hinduism not bahai not

712
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,240
Shinto the thing is you don't need to be

713
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,360
a hardcore Christian to be a part of

714
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,960
this anybody who wants to stand for a

715
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,120
greater future can stand for all this do

716
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,000
you believe in a higher power do you

717
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,200
stand against neoism well that's all you

718
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,720
really need the real enemy is atheistic

719
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,880
nihilism and the cultural and

720
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,520
demographic shift that is being forced

721
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,480
upon the West like I mentioned Richard

722
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,880
Dawkins the most insistent enemy of

723
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
Christianity has turned around and said

724
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,039
that Christianity is actually worth

725
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,840
defending in fact if you ask Jordan

726
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,360
Peterson if he believes in God he

727
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,120
actually never says yes or no he always

728
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,440
says I act as though God exists I always

729
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,200
thought this was hogwash I always

730
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
thought he was trying to avoid the

731
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,480
question by using fancy words and

732
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,000
philosophy I don't think so anymore

733
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,919
there's some truth in what he says

734
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,080
nobody can just decide to have faith

735
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,240
faith is not a switch that you can

736
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,600
simply turn on and off if I tell you

737
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,039
I'll give you a million dollars if you

738
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
believe for one day that the sky is

739
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,360
purple you still couldn't really do it

740
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,520
there's no way to choose consciously to

741
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,200
have faith or believe anything but by

742
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,679
acting as though you do have faith in a

743
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,440
higher power is a potential First Step

744
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,440
you instantly get a power boost if you

745
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,679
do this prayer absolutely gives you a

746
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,480
power boost now I had to find my own way

747
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,039
to that point and learn how to harness

748
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,200
this power because nobody really teaches

749
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,679
this in any really understandable way

750
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,080
anymore but there is a way think about

751
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,200
this the greatest weaknesses of

752
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,360
self-improvement is that it is so

753
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,000
self-centered self-improvement begins

754
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,559
and ends with you it all hinges on how

755
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,919
to improve yourself for your own

756
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,880
gratification and really nothing more it

757
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,159
could be girls it could be cars or the

758
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,039
most boring of all it could be just a

759
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,360
bank balance peasant mentality instead

760
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,200
of going to the gym for female attention

761
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,480
what if you went to the gym to honor the

762
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,559
temple that is your body what if you

763
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,960
dedicated the last and most difficult

764
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,640
set to something greater this is a

765
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,200
practical change that you can make right

766
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,360
now start dedicating things to something

767
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,480
bigger than yourself this extends to

768
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,799
other things and of course if you don't

769
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,399
want to do spiritual stuff that's fine

770
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,559
if you're at work cool dedicate the work

771
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,440
not just to your your advancement but

772
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,360
perhaps the family you plan to have the

773
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,720
kids who are yet to be born the

774
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,519
ancestors who allowed you to exist this

775
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,720
gives you a frame that absolutely

776
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,320
swallows nihilism you cannot be

777
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,760
nihilistic if you go about your daily

778
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,760
task with a degree of Excellence because

779
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,919
you aren't doing everything for yourself

780
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,840
but always for something greater this

781
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,399
Frame will naturally lead to doing

782
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,279
higher quality work because you cannot

783
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,960
possibly do lower quality work and

784
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,360
dedicated to any higher power do it for

785
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,480
God your family your parents your future

786
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,519
Legacy you can see the truth of this in

787
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,039
the gym dedicate your last set to the

788
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,080
heavens and you will notice the weights

789
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,120
feel lighter try this today and tell me

790
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,440
if it doesn't work it's not just the gym

791
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,960
of course where this applies you're

792
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,559
struggling with noof fap or any kind of

793
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,760
addiction squeak out a tiny prayer

794
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,919
before typing the letter P on the

795
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,200
keyboard I guarantee you won't be able

796
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,640
to finish typing it out you basically

797
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,279
take your small amount of willpower and

798
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,240
multiply it times infinity if you're

799
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,960
struggling with diet it's very hard to

800
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,080
stuff your mouth with Cheetos knowing

801
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,799
that your body is the Temple of your

802
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,840
spirit this even extends to social

803
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,480
skills and Charisma when you move

804
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,440
through the world with the feeling that

805
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,000
the forces of Heaven have got your back

806
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,320
you just give off a different kind of

807
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,760
energy people notice it and they take

808
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,399
you seriously I know this sounds crazy I

809
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,880
know this sounds made up I can easily

810
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,799
make some kind of pseudo scientific

811
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,519
rationale saying well people are just

812
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,399
responding to your new found confidence

813
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,039
right but who cares I don't care about

814
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,240
the explanation of why it works just

815
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,880
that it does if you want a full more

816
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,880
like actionable guide let me know in the

817
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,000
comments this video is mostly the

818
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,720
knowledge the second part of this is how

819
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,440
do you tap into that vital energy that I

820
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,720
spoke of there are two answers the first

821
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,519
answer is in esoteric Health I've made

822
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,080
many videos about this topic and I would

823
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,480
like you to put them into action the

824
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,880
second answer is to absorb energy from

825
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,080
past Heroes every culture of this Earth

826
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,640
has a version of this there are energies

827
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,279
that can be absorbed by reading about

828
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,240
the Deeds of Achilles Caesar and

829
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,440
Alexander if e vitalism is more to your

830
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,799
taste then read the ramayan and the

831
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,679
Mahabharat the heroism and the Grand

832
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,519
Adventure of the East is no less in the

833
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,600
west if you know what to look for

834
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,399
specifically here's what I recommend all

835
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,240
men and women of the new intelligencia

836
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,640
must read The Iliad this is

837
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,799
non-negotiable however the ilad is a

838
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,559
difficult book to get into because it

839
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,240
gives zero context for the Trojan War it

840
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,880
jumps right into the middle of the story

841
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,360
and gives zero character introductions

842
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
it assumes that the reader is already

843
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,960
familiar with the setting so I don't

844
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,360
recommend The Iliad for a beginner or a

845
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,960
novice instead you should read Troy by

846
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,039
Steven fry this is an amazing book that

847
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,799
does Justice to The Iliad while actually

848
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,880
improving upon it by providing context

849
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,880
historical analysis mythological

850
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,159
analysis and additional stories from the

851
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,600
same time period to give you a rounded

852
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,240
experience of the Trojan War one of the

853
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,799
best books I've ever read strongly

854
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,440
recommend so is this surge of vital

855
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,919
Christianity going to sweep across the

856
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,679
West no it is not the normies will never

857
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,880
never understand this think about how a

858
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,039
Normy will will react to this video they

859
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,919
won't get it right the average person is

860
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,600
not courageous enough to be a Christian

861
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,679
nor do they have the raw vital energy of

862
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,720
the classical man they cannot be a part

863
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,399
of this mov and that's fine cultural

864
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,679
change does not come from convincing

865
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,200
everybody of your views cultural change

866
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,320
comes from the the conversion of the

867
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,559
intelligencia the current intelligencia

868
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,960
are informed by their college education

869
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,039
and it's not serving them the leftist

870
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,039
thought leads only in One Direction

871
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,360
downwards it leads to socialism atheism

872
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,880
and eventually Hedonism nihilism and

873
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,960
even physical ugliness leftists pursue

874
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,399
pleasure above all because why not the

875
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,679
leftist thought believes that nothing

876
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,799
really matters because at the end of the

877
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,960
day everything ends in the heat dep of

878
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,840
the universe so there's no logical point

879
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,960
in denying pleasure firstly we do not

880
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,279
know if the universe will end in a heat

881
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,000
death and secondly there is an antidote

882
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,039
to nihilism in fact there's more than

883
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,480
one antidote to nihilism one of the

884
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,600
antidotes is Faith but there are answers

885
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,279
as well the pursuit of beauty Legacy

886
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Family and art nobody even talks about

887
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,799
these even the self-improvement guys

888
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,120
will basically cap out at build body get

889
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,919
girls buy cars this is why I believe we

890
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,000
will see a revitalization of this

891
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,679
ancient Spirit the new intelligencia

892
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,840
will be informed not by the top- down

893
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,960
structures of the University Systems nor

894
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,880
the big and famous celebrities but by

895
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,600
doing their own research and reading

896
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,600
they will be informed by reading history

897
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,960
and philosophy but by also watching

898
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,679
YouTube videos and why not YouTube is

899
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,880
the new Public Square this is the

900
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,559
battlefield of ideas and this is where

901
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,639
the ideas of the new intelligencia will

902
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,880
be shaped and you will be the one to

903
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:11,120
shape it now if you decide to go the

904
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,799
Christian route I have one more tool of

905
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,480
power for you I'm not telling you to be

906
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,360
a Christian I have zero authority to

907
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,200
tell anybody what to believe but if you

908
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,799
did desde to go that route then I will

909
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,480
ask you this if Christ is King then

910
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,000
surely he needs his Knights are you

911
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,799
worthy of that title exactly 5 years a

912
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,120
the notredame cathedral was burned and

913
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,960
the authorities said that it was an

914
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,200
accident but there are many questions

915
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,679
and observations that indicate otherwise

916
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,159
Christians did nothing about the

917
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:43,360
desecration of one of the most important

918
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,039
and greatest monuments to Beauty

919
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,159
architecture mathematics and

920
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,240
Christianity I believe that if the same

921
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,760
thing happened 10 years from now there

922
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,760
would be a very different

923
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,440
reaction a good question to ask is

924
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,880
what's my St in all this do I have a dog

925
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,559
in this fight obviously I am not off the

926
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,480
West so why should I really care well

927
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,440
from a personal standpoint I have one

928
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,639
foot in the west and one foot in the

929
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,320
East I was born in the East but some of

930
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,760
my most important memories are in the

931
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,000
West My First Crush was in the west but

932
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,960
my first kiss was in the East but the

933
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,200
first time I got laid was in the west

934
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,960
three different girls mind you the first

935
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,320
money I made was in the west all my

936
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,800
degrees are in the West in some sense my

937
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,679
home is in the west so this gives me a

938
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,839
wide perspective of the playing field I

939
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
respect and understand both cultures and

940
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,240
I can say with confidence that the West

941
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,040
deserves to survive and thrive perhaps I

942
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,200
am just a messenger of sorts and

943
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,839
secondly my parents sacrificed much to

944
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,839
get me and my sister here and I'll be

945
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,320
damned if I can't do my part to secure

946
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,480
the price of their sacrifice this

947
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,240
another question you should be asking me

948
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,159
is why did I stop being an atheist I

949
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,679
told you the story of me walking into my

950
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,560
childhood home and watching my mom cry

951
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,440
because she thought her brother was dead

952
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,000
I didn't tell you the full story a few

953
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,920
days before 9/11 my grandmother called

954
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,680
and spoke to my mom and I overheard the

955
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
whole

956
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,839
conversation my grandmother was telling

957
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,480
my mom of a dream that she had she

958
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:15,839
described a dark and scary tunnel with a

959
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,119
train track inside which is very

960
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,079
confusing to her in this Vision she she

961
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,160
saw a wondrous being of light running

962
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,720
full speed at this train fearlessly

963
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,560
trying to stop it she didn't know what

964
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,440
to make of the dream of course but she

965
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,040
knew that it was a sign of great danger

966
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,560
to her son my mother's brother my uncle

967
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,160
who worked at the World Trade Center she

968
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,200
knew that she would pray for her son but

969
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,599
that's all she could really do on 9/11

970
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,320
which is a few days after this dream we

971
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,359
genuinely thought he was dead all

972
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,119
Communications went down after the

973
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:50,400
attack and it was impossible to make a

974
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,680
phone call to that area but then he

975
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,760
called he was not dead he was alive and

976
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,760
he told us the story there was a subway

977
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,440
station under the World Trade Center and

978
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,079
he was going to get on the rail to go to

979
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,200
that subway station because it's his

980
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,800
office he was late to work that day

981
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,560
because something had come up but he

982
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,040
missed his regular time he waited and

983
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,599
got into the one right after but some

984
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,599
alarms went off and they had to evacuate

985
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,599
the one that he was supposed to be on

986
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,960
was under the building at the time and

987
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,640
was crushed by the collapse how do you

988
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,200
explain this kind of thing I had kind of

989
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,839
put this memory out of my mind for

990
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,920
decades but in recent years I've been

991
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,040
observing more phenomena that challenge

992
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,359
the purely materialistic worldview that

993
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,119
I deeply held before I close out I want

994
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:37,079
to share one of these phenomena with you

995
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,319
I'm actually really struggling because I

996
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,240
don't know if I should share this

997
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,440
because I don't think anybody's going to

998
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,640
believe me but it's fine I think I'm

999
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,640
driven to share this so I I'll do

1000
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,040
it I want to show you something really

1001
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,680
cool I want to show you the back of this

1002
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,200
jacket the back of this jacket has this

1003
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,920
beautiful patch and this is the painting

1004
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,920
of the Archangel triumphant Archangel

1005
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,240
Michael Triumph

1006
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,480
and it's important to me

1007
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,359
because I had a vision or dream of this

1008
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,200
painting years ago and it struck with me

1009
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,400
and it was in my memory and I didn't

1010
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,079
know it was a real painting and then

1011
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,839
eventually I came to learn that it was a

1012
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,640
real painting and I was just struck with

1013
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,880
awe because i' had seen this painting in

1014
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,400
detail before knowing it was even a real

1015
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,920
thing a real physical painting and I was

1016
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,200
in Europe last summer I I had a

1017
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,200
beautiful Europe tour I I traed the path

1018
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,640
of Hannibal Barka as he goes through

1019
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,640
Spain and France through Italy through

1020
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,839
the Alps and into actual Italy proper

1021
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,000
and in that journey in Florence I had

1022
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,520
this jacket made I didn't think of it

1023
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,119
too much I went to Rome and I had this

1024
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,200
thought why don't I just Google where

1025
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,520
this painting is actually located and it

1026
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,400
turns out this painting is in a small

1027
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,280
little unknown church that was within

1028
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,640
walking distance of where I lived in

1029
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,839
Rome pure coincidence and every every

1030
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,160
day for 7even days that I was in Rome I

1031
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,319
went and spent time in this church my

1032
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,319
first time ever spending any time in any

1033
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,760
church and I suppose to some extent that

1034
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:14,839
the video that you are watching right

1035
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,520
now is a product of my experience in

1036
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,520
Rome
