1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,600
I'm going to teach you how to overclock

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,000
your brain using methylene blue so

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,639
methylene blue is a mitochondrial

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,519
support supplement and mitochondria as

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,679
you probably heard in like every single

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,960
bio class that's ever happened that

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,520
mitochondria is the PowerHouse of the

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
cell so where do you find mitochondria

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,240
you'll find

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,920
mitochondria in almost I mean literally

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,800
every cell but they're highly

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,080
concentrated in the neurons which is

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
what our brain is made of so it comes as

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,880
no surprise then

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,440
that methylene blue is going to increase

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,360
your cognition so your power to think

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,960
your ability to solve mathematical

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,640
problems to work through Solutions and

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,680
to have even more

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,239
creativity also it's no surprise that it

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,760
improves memory both shortterm and

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,440
longterm you have more energy overall

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
because your neurons are able to fire

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,480
more efficiently and finally you have

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,000
more Focus which is to me the most

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
important aspect why

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,559
because time is not the most important

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,840
resource a lot of people think that time

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,920
is a finite resource and it's really

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,720
important it's important sure but you

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,040
only have 24 hours per day and no matter

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
what you do you're not going to get more

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,479
hours it's energy and focus that

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
actually gives value to time so anything

35
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,560
that improves my focus is going to be

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,159
highly beneficial to

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,320
me so how does it work you know how is

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
it possible that the same exact

39
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,799
supplement also improves skin like how

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,200
can a brain supplement improve skin and

41
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,720
it comes down to the mechanism of action

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
and when you saw that it increases

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,720
energy and focus you probably thought

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
well is it kind of like caffeine is it

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,560
like coffee and the answer is it's not

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,439
so coffee caffeine let's say it works by

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
a receptor being bound to by that

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
caffeine molecule it binds to the

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,240
adenosine receptor in the brain trying

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,799
to trick the brain into thinking it has

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,680
more energy than it actually has it

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,159
doesn't actually give you any energy

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,200
methylene blue does not bind to

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
receptors that's not its mechanism of

55
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,920
action it acts directly on the

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,079
mitochondria that's why it has all these

57
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,680
wide ranging effects because every

58
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,840
single cell has mitochondria in it how

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,599
does it work well let's go so you know

60
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,200
that mitochondria is is a Powerhouse of

61
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,640
the cell and it produces energy for the

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,319
cell all this stuff but how does it do

63
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,200
it so what's mitochondria actually doing

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,800
is when you have food and you have

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,879
glucose the first complex inside

66
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,680
mitochondria so mitochondria has five

67
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,920
complexes 1 2 3 4 and five actually

68
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,959
grabs an electron from your glucose and

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:38,519
and it shunts it from complex 1 to 2 2

70
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,560
to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 and from five comes

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,560
out

72
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:47,360
ATP ATP is energy so think of this as a

73
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,319
race car engine all right and each of

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,000
these are like Pistons try to convert

75
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,840
that fuel into into momentum into energy

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
all right so what happens then if you if

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,040
you disrupt this it's a good question

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,480
isn't it that's happening to most people

79
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,879
a lot of people a majority of people I

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,159
would say have poor metabolic Health

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,400
which means that they have broken

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,080
mitochondria they have damaged

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,959
mitochondria and of course if you're

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,720
thinking of this as a race car engine

85
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,760
not only do you get energy you also get

86
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,040
waste products you get smoke in the cell

87
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,560
this is in the form of R oos reactive

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,280
oxygen species that's what the cell even

89
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,040
naturally produces even an undamaged

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,599
mitochondria is going to produce some

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,879
level of R so when you have a damage in

92
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,040
the mitochondria let's say the complex

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,159
one is no longer able to move electrons

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,920
to complex 2 you have a disruption let's

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,480
say you have a disruption between two

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,000
and three so if you have an engine and

97
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,959
you damage it somehow what's going to

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,280
happen first you're going to have less

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,079
energy obviously you're going to have

100
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,120
less energy but you're also going to

101
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,079
have more waste products and these waste

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,680
products are toxic so you really don't

103
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,920
want these in your body if you can help

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,360
it and let's talk about how methylene

105
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,360
blue plays a role in all this so

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,519
speaking of damage to mitochondria you

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
might be wondering like how does this

108
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,959
damage even happen and it happens to

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,120
many reasons obviously one of them is um

110
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,519
oxidative stress another is seed oils so

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
seed oils like safflower oil sunflower

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,360
oil soybean oil canola oil all these

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,520
seed oils what they're going to do

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,600
is they are going to

115
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,600
interfere with the mitochondria because

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,400
oxidized seed oils have these byproducts

117
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,280
called aldhy and that's not that's not

118
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,840
the only byproduct by the way these

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,039
alides are going to damage the membrane

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
and these complexes are situated on the

121
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,600
membrane so you can see how that's not

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,360
going to really help is it so was

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,680
methylene blue do methylene blue is an

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,720
electron

125
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,479
donor so if there's a break in the

126
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,320
circuit between complex 1 and two and 2

127
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:02,080
and three methylene blue can actually

128
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:04,039
donate an electron straight to complex 3

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,919
and you immediately have the restarting

130
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:09,080
of this electron chain and you can still

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,680
produce ATP and yeah you still produce

132
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,360
reactive oxygen species and now this is

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,440
where it gets interesting the same

134
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,919
methylene blue that can donate an

135
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,759
electron and thereby keep this engine

136
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,039
functioning can actually

137
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,080
neutralize the reactive oxygen species

138
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,120
which is because methylene blue is a

139
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,800
auto reducing agent there's not that

140
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,919
many out there Myan blue is kind of rare

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
because of this property it not only

142
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,600
boosts the energy function of the

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
mitochondria it also deletes the waste

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,520
products of the said mitochondria now

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
you can see how it's really powerful now

146
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
you can see why it would affect all

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,240
these different things from the brain to

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,160
skin so let's briefly talk about the

149
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,280
skin side of things so there's actually

150
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,759
research which shows that mitochondri

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,240
sorry not mitochondria methylene blue

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,720
will cause skin to reverse age causes a

153
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,639
reversal of Aging bizarre but it's true

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,800
it causes skin to be more elastic more

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,599
lustrous more thick and it's because

156
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,560
skin cells are cells like any other

157
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,280
cells if they incur damage it's a

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
struggle to fix it if you have bad

159
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,720
mitochondria fixing the mitochondria

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,520
allows skin cells to fixs and also

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,000
proliferate and generate more cells if

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
some of them die or get damaged so

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that's why help with skin and I found

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,919
this interesting product which I want to

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,960
show you which is this company

166
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
they took Tallow bomb which is already

167
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,800
the best skincare product on the planet

168
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,960
and they infused it with methylene blue

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,319
this thing is called miraki

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,599
moo and now you might be asking the

171
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,280
question well is it actually better than

172
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,360
the product which I suggested before

173
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,280
which is the Vintage tradition Tallow

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,160
bom and I've been experimenting with

175
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,560
both of them and I actually still prefer

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,639
the Vintage tradition you can see like

177
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,840
this has been around I've almost used

178
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,240
all of it that's not sure why the

179
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,440
Vintage tradition is still

180
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,720
better but I've done the experiments

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,479
right I've done it experiment on myself

182
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,039
so what I found is with the makaki moo

183
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,280
product I have to reapply it during half

184
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,039
the day but the Vintage tradition

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
product I never have to reapply it you

186
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,599
only have to reapply it after you wash

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,960
your face or take a shower so I still

188
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,960
prefer the the OG vintage tradition

189
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,400
Tallow bom if you want to my opinion on

190
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,639
it so there we have it boys that's why

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,599
it improves all these things now those

192
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,400
who are astute have noticed that I said

193
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,560
it reduces viruses and that's because

194
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,599
indeed methylene blue is an

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,680
antiparasitic which parasites are a

196
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,720
whole different topic a whole can of

197
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,440
worms yes a can of worms indeed which I

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,280
will go into in a future video but it is

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
in fact an antiviral which is why it was

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,319
used against malaria for quite a long

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,319
time and which is why a certain new

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,440
invent in

203
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,080
infection actually methylene blue can be

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,080
effective against that I won't mention

205
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,560
it by name but I think you understand

206
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,720
what I'm talking

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
about though it is an antiviral and it's

208
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,199
an antibacterial so you might be

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,319
thinking well if it's an antibacterial

210
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,960
then could it possibly harm the gut

211
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,440
microbiome good question if you're

212
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,360
thinking in that way then I'm proud of

213
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,240
you that's the way you should be

214
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,560
thinking and I Al actually put off B

215
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,879
mealine blue for the longest time

216
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,159
because you know it could affect the gut

217
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,440
microbiome even if has these benefits

218
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,440
like I don't want to really compromise

219
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
my gut

220
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,440
health but I looked into it and there's

221
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,039
research and this is a really cool piece

222
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,959
of research by the way they took a bunch

223
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:44,000
of mice they let's call them mice a b

224
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,720
and c and they ran them with different

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,279
quantities of methylen blue group a

226
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,120
didn't get any methylene blue Group B

227
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,680
got a pretty decent dose of methylene

228
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,600
blue and group C got a mega dose a super

229
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,200
dose of methylin blue like they got I

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,920
think they were given like 50 g of

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
methylene blue per kilogram of body

232
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,560
weight which is ridiculous these mice

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
were probably blue for like

234
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,360
weeks well so they took these mice put

235
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,560
them through mazes as scientists are

236
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,800
want to do and what they found

237
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,800
was mice a underperformed which is

238
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,560
obvious because you know if you have

239
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,000
mice B and C with all these benefits IQ

240
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,399
well it's not actually IQ it's more like

241
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
cognitive power but increased cognitive

242
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,920
power increased memory then obviously

243
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,160
they're going to perform the maze better

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
cuz what do you need to solve a maze you

245
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,920
need memory you need energy you need

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,680
Focus so mice B and mice C easily won

247
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
over mice a and now they looked at the

248
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,560
gut microbiome they found that mice A

249
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
and B were the same so a moderate dose

250
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,200
of methylene blue doesn't seem to change

251
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,920
the microbiome now they looked at the

252
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,040
mega doed methylene blue mice in group C

253
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,360
and what they found was there was a

254
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,560
small change in the gut microbiome so it

255
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,839
seems as though even with a quite a

256
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,360
large dose of methylene blue it doesn't

257
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,760
completely screw up your gut health and

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
obviously no one's going to be taking 50

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
g of methylene blue per kilogram that

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
would be a ridiculous amount of

261
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,079
methylene blue and there's no reason to

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,959
be taking that much and of course I'm

263
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,000
going to talk about dosages soon but it

264
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,680
does seem to me that it's fine to take

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,320
it in terms of gut health and of course

266
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,120
none of what I'm giving you here is

267
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,560
medicinal advice it is all just for

268
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,360
educational purposes whatever risks that

269
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,600
you want to occur are up to you it's not

270
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,839
my

271
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,720
responsibility I'm just sharing with you

272
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,720
my personal experience with this

273
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,639
particular

274
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,360
supplement so let's talk about another

275
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,079
thing which is going on which is another

276
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,440
side effect which a lot of people notice

277
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,160
which is an increase in anxiety you see

278
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,600
have put actually lowering stress but a

279
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,200
lot of people will tell you that methine

280
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,440
blue increases anxiety so I looked into

281
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,120
it and it confusing because why would

282
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360
something that increases ATP production

283
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,600
cause increased anxiety didn't make

284
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,800
sense especially when you consider that

285
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,959
ATP and energy are relaxing they make

286
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,839
you more

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,519
relaxed in fact if you take a dead piece

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,760
of muscle tissue it's going to be kind

289
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,360
of rigid right but if you put it in a

290
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,079
bat of ATP it will actually become more

291
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,440
lifelike it'll become more Supple become

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,920
more like how it was in in life cuz

293
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,079
energy is life ATP is energy so it's

294
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,839
really a puzzle why some would be more

295
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,440
anxious with the introduction of

296
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,639
methylene blue I was thinking about this

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,760
and I realized that what is anxiety

298
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,320
really anxiety is a recurring thoughts

299
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,680
of recurring negative thoughts really so

300
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,760
if you have increased computational

301
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,839
power increased recall and increased

302
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,680
focus on those negative thoughts of

303
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,120
course you're going to feel more anxious

304
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,560
so it's not that methylene blue per se

305
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
is increasing anxiety it's more so that

306
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,920
methylene glue is eliminating brain fog

307
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
allowing you to come head-to-head with

308
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
your anxiety I think that's what's

309
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,279
happening here so if you have anxiety

310
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,519
symptoms because of meal blue it's

311
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,200
likely that you just have bad mental

312
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,040
health and that should be the priority

313
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,800
you should be working on not some kind

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,600
of productivity supplement you should

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,880
work on the basics the fundamentals of

316
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,519
basic mental health so of course that's

317
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,279
going to be a topic onto itself so I

318
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,880
won't go into it but that's another

319
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,199
concern mealine blue is just a

320
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,079
supplement boys it's just a supplement

321
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,519
the fundamentals always matter more

322
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,720
nutrition and detox and mental health

323
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,240
are the foundations for a happy life

324
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
methylin blue is something which can

325
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,160
help but it is not the foundation and

326
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,639
never intended to be so I have two

327
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,079
courses the nutrition course and the

328
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
detox course but I don't have anything

329
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,360
on Mental Health I think I should

330
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
probably make something like that so

331
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,199
there you have it that is methylene blue

332
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,639
and that's how it works question is like

333
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,639
how do you get it where do you get it

334
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,040
from how much do you have and what are

335
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,920
the other side effects there's another

336
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,880
side effects which is kind of funny when

337
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,120
you start taking MB you will you'll piss

338
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,839
blue like straight up your urine will be

339
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,440
blue in color this is not something you

340
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,519
should be afraid of it happens to

341
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:20,839
everybody it's an expected side effect

342
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:23,279
so dosages where is the stuff this is I

343
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,199
didn't have that much left this is my

344
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,720
vial of methylene blue the dosages I

345
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:35,360
take one dropper so this has a dropper

346
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,040
right so I take one drop of this let me

347
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,480
actually show you properly I take one

348
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,639
drop or full before I hit any kind of

349
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,399
important task so what I mean by that is

350
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't actually take it every day I

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,760
take it when I need it so I'll take it

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,360
before I am trying to come up with a

353
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,920
video I'll take it before a live lecture

354
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,240
like this I'll take it when I'm doing

355
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,759
something which requires my full

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,199
attention and full cognition power so I

357
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,440
take it only when I need it because

358
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,440
that's my attitude towards any kind of

359
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,720
supplement you only supplement when you

360
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,480
think you need it you don't take a

361
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,240
supplement every single day unless you

362
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
have some kind of condition you should

363
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,639
be getting most of what you need from

364
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,000
just Whole Foods so I use this as a tool

365
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,279
rather than a

366
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,120
fundamental you can take two droppers

367
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,199
actually and if you are really focusing

368
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,560
on something I would be okay with taking

369
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,759
two droppers of Metaline blue which each

370
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,920
dropper is 5 mg so there you go I take

371
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,399
two droppers if I really need it one

372
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,759
dropper usually

373
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,000
that's about

374
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,480
dosage now where do you get it from so

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,399
this is very important boys so there's

376
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,040
two grades of mealine blue there is the

377
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,639
industrial grade and there is the

378
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,440
pharmaceutical grade you're obviously

379
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,560
looking for pharmaceutical gr grade

380
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,160
because the industrial grade has heavy

381
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,600
metals it's going to poison

382
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,079
you so you need to look for two things

383
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,959
you need to look for USP verified which

384
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,000
means that it is pharmaceutical grade

385
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,440
verified and you need to look for a COA

386
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
which is a certificate of analysis and

387
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,759
it's done by like a lab which actually

388
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,720
goes through it and sees if it is a pure

389
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,040
product I get all my methine blue holy

390
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,040
 this flies around here boys I get

391
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,360
all my methine blue from the same

392
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,480
company which makes the Tallow product

393
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,639
maraki medicinal and this is what I

394
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,160
suggest I actually reached out to them

395
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,399
looked at their COA and I I trust in

396
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,959
them because obviously I use their

397
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,320
product so I reached out to them got a

398
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,160
discount code for 15% off if you want to

399
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,199
use it you could do that and there we

400
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,279
have it that's your entire rundown on

401
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,279
Metaline blue I know I covered quite a

402
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,399
lot of information in this video if you

403
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,279
want a official summary of everything

404
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,399
we've discussed so far there is an email

405
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,759
intake form in the description I will

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,160
send you my personal show notes every

407
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,240
single time there's a lecture you'll get

408
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,160
the show notes so if you want that and

409
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,240
all the links everything will be

410
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,920
included right so put your email in

411
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,199
there other than that tomorrow's lecture

412
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,079
is going to be on the red white and blue

413
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:00,639
protocol what's that so right now it's

414
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,800
winter I mean you may not guess that

415
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,319
it's winter

416
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,560
because I'm in Hawaii and the place is

417
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:09,639
gorgeous it's always kind of summer or

418
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,040
spring here but if you are in the the

419
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,199
United States or in the UK and the in

420
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,880
European countries it's winter right now

421
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,240
so you don't have a lot of sunlight it's

422
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,360
likely that you're not having a lot of

423
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,639
movement you're not getting a lot of

424
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,720
exercise you might have seasonal

425
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,079
depression which is nothing it's not

426
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,560
actually a depression it's more like a

427
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,519
metabolic health issue and it's a

428
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,040
vitamin D deficiency so I'm going to

429
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,120
create well I'm not going to create I'm

430
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,600
going to give a lecture on the red white

431
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,360
and blue protocol which eliminates that

432
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,680
completely from your life I used to live

433
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,279
in Indiana so I know how it feels like

434
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,240
to have gray skies day after day for 6

435
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,319
months so this is going to be really

436
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,519
helpful for those who are living in cold

437
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,759
climates and finally if you like me I'm

438
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,560
not talking about my content if you like

439
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,560
me personally then follow me on

440
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,600
Instagram you get to know like what I do

441
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,639
on a daily basis and other random

442
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,880
information as I'm living my life I

443
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,240
share it on Instagram all right boys

444
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,240
that's the lecture I appreciate your

445
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,400
time I'll see you in the next one and

446
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,280
I'll flip this camera around and see if

447
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,280
there's any questions
