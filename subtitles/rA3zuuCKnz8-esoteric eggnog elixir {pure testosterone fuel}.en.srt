1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,880
your whey protein has nothing on this

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,259
this is a jar of eggnog and you might

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,179
think eggnog is that Christmas you know

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,040
celebration treat which makes you fat

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,860
it's not think about it eggnogs

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,960
ingredients eggs milk whipping cream

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,480
honey in my case

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,359
cinnamon vanilla extract nothing more

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,220
perfectly healthy ingredients which make

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,840
this amazing testosterone boosting drink

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,160
think about like it has a cholesterol

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,320
and healthy fats that you need for your

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,939
hormonal development has proteins from

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
the egg whites which are of course for

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,760
you know muscle building and everything

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,200
and it has milk which is another

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,579
delicious compound of literally

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
everything you need for your body to

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,840
function

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
cinnamon which has thermogenic effects

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,600
and let's get started I'll tell you how

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,120
exactly to make this just look at it

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
it's beautiful if you serve this chilled

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,440
with cinnamon on top

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,219
it's game over so this thing is the

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,780
perfect drink for post-workout you know

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,399
if you're done working out it'll give

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,660
you literally all the ingredients your

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,340
minerals

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,260
your electrolytes everything back

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,540
restored you're ready to go it's also

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,100
great for before you sleep because your

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,299
body actually makes testosterone when

34
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,939
you sleep

35
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,380
hope hope this thing's recording your

36
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,540
body makes testosterone when you sleep

37
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,460
so if your body is provided with

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,900
you know the healthy fat it needs the

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,700
actual saturated in fact it needs to

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,020
create testosterone you're going to have

41
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,960
a boost when you wake up in the morning

42
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,540
and this will take the shape of a boner

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,860
if you are a man and if you're a female

44
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,000
of course you want to get a testosterone

45
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,000
boost but you will get the

46
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,259
female endocrine systems are extremely

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,540
complicated and I don't want to get into

48
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,240
that topic let's just say you'll be more

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,320
hormonally healthy regardless of male or

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,900
female

51
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,340
all right let's get back into the actual

52
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,439
cooking video

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,840
we have eggs

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,060
milk cinnamon honey heavy whipping cream

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,460
and vanilla extract which is an optional

56
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,799
but you can have it so eggs you want the

57
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,759
high quality best quality eggs you can

58
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,200
find

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,820
usually the difference between the price

60
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,680
of low quality eggs and high quality

61
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,420
eggs is a couple bucks

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,819
if you're going to spend five bucks on

63
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,440
anything getting high quality eggs is

64
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,000
one of those best places to spend it

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,819
because there is a genuine difference

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,940
between free range eggs and just your

67
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,340
carton you know those thermocol carton

68
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,500
eggs you find in Walmart those hens have

69
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,959
lived their entire lives in a coop

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,400
indoors have never seen the Sun so they

71
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,020
don't have any vitamin D in their own

72
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
system so their eggs don't have any

73
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,520
vitamin D so you don't get any vitamin D

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,319
from eating those eggs these hens from

75
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,420
which I got these eggs

76
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,760
you know they spend their life Outdoors

77
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,280
eating bugs and worms and whatever it is

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,140
and they have the micronutrients they

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,420
essentially assimilate into their own

80
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,180
body systems and lay in the form of eggs

81
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,879
which I eat which keeps me healthy so

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,300
get the good quality eggs my boys

83
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,340
eggs so that's one ingredient let's go

84
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,980
ahead and process this ingredient what

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,360
we're going to do is I need a bowl a

86
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,680
second bowl

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,400
okay

88
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,220
so we're going to separate the egg yolks

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,800
from the egg white this is an important

90
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,239
step don't mess it up so what we're

91
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,019
trying to do is

92
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,019
crack the egg

93
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,900
and catch the yolk

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,840
all right easy crack the egg catch the

95
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,000
yolk that should be all you do

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,300
so I've already washed my hands and

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,580
everything so make sure you're being

98
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,239
sanitary with this

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,459
so you catch the a yolk let the whites

100
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,280
kind of just filter through your fingers

101
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,040
and that's how you separate them so you

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,220
kind of do want as clean a separation as

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,260
you can get the reason is the egg whites

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,840
are made of proteins and the egg yolks

105
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,239
are made of fats so

106
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,720
in the later stage of this recipe we are

107
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,400
going to be whisking the egg whites

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,860
and when you're whisking the egg whites

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,000
if there's any fat in it it'll prevent

110
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,739
the egg whites from from becoming a foam

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,060
and it's not the end of the world or

112
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,200
anything like if you get a little bit of

113
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,260
egg yolk in your egg whites it doesn't

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,519
do anything but that's just some more

115
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,840
information to know to make this recipe

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,699
perfect

117
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,380
so I'm trying to separate this as best I

118
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,000
can

119
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,180
and by the way guys

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,740
huge thanks for visiting this channel I

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,820

possible

127
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,080
I assume that it's going to take six

128
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,540
months to a year to get to 1K

129
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,580
subscribers but to get to 7K within a

130
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,320
week that's basically 1000 subscribers

131
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,280

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,660

that's a skill you're going to use for

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
the rest of your life you know you they

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,139
all talk about high value skills like

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,320
coding or God knows what at this point

152
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,400
but what about cooking you know if you

153
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,380
have somebody to cook for you're good

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,080
for you but like most of us we need to

155
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,400
know our basic recipes to keep ourselves

156
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,560
healthy

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,940
so yeah let me get just wash my hands

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,759
I'll get back into it

159
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,380
so by the way soap right I'm gonna use

160
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,220
soap to wash my hands

161
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,800
the soap which you use might be killing

162
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,560
your testosterone let me explain

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,240
so always reading ingredient list of the

164
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Soaps and shampoos that you're using

165
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,180
because a lot of them will have

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,699
something called parabens

167
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,400
parabens which come in two forms ethyl

168
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,800
and metal paraben these essentially are

169
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,880
endocrine disruptors so without going

170
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,919
into like how they function and

171
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,180
everything basically they messed your

172
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,680
system up and they reduce your

173
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,360
testosterone so

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,380
make sure you buy soap it doesn't have

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,979
those

176
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,860
yeah so coming back yolks eggs egg

177
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,259
whites that is separated I'm also going

178
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,660
to have to heat my milk up

179
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,979
which I need I need a sauce man

180
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,979
okay let me get that real quick

181
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,900
all right so

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,139
that was that yeah the milk

183
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,680
okay so I am using

184
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,560
organic grass-fed grass-finished whole

185
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,660
milk not that two percent or skim milk

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,060
why would anybody even drink skim milk

187
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,280
the best part of the milk is removed in

188
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,720
skim milk basically water I don't

189
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,940
understand why people drink things like

190
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,160
skim milk or two percent the best part

191
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,139
is in whole milk try to get raw milk if

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,699
you can but you know most people the

193
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,380
best you can do in grocery stores is

194
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,259
probably past uh low temperature

195
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,400
pasteurized

196
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,440
non-homogenized milk that's what I'm

197
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,599
using so it basically means that this

198
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
milk is as natural as you can get and

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,300
cream will actually rise to the top

200
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,139
that's how you know it's good quality

201
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,440
milk

202
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,780
so it's one cup of whole milk

203
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,419
no skim milk allowed guys that

204
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,460
that's just nasty

205
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,680
um heavy whipping cream

206
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,120
nothing too special about this just just

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,360
heavy whipping cream

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,699
I'll do one cup so

209
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,440
I'm doing a one-to-one ratio of the milk

210
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,180
and heavy whipping cream

211
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,520
uh I think that's what tastes best but

212
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,680
it's completely up to you what you want

213
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,740
try to experiment with it this will

214
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,860
determine the thickness and consistency

215
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,080
oh yeah it's good of the end product so

216
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,580
you know depending on your taste you can

217
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,919
change this ratio

218
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,020
so I put it on the heat

219
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm not trying to make it boil

220
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm trying to get it just below boiling

221
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,500
so just when it has steam coming off but

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
it's not actually boiling that's the

223
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,180
ideal place to stop that's what's going

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,160
to essentially kill the bacteria and

225
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,680
potential salmonella in the egg so when

226
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,360
that's on the heat we are going to work

227
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,379
with the eggs

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
honey

229
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,800
so

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,380
eggnog recipes traditionally like the

231
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,380
Christmas ones contain a

232
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,440
H I try to not curse on this channel

233
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,260
calm peace clean content

234
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,459
so honey instead of sugar because sugar

235
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,660
is cancer honey is the good stuff

236
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,040
especially if you get high quality honey

237
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,240
so what's high quality honey right if

238
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,880
you're trying to find out

239
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,700
it's if when you see

240
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,920
raw and unfiltered that's a good sign

241
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,600
but if you can get unheated if you can

242
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,480
get unheated honey

243
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,399
that's the ultimate best quality honey

244
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,839
that you can find but it's hard to find

245
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,800
though so don't stress out just get the

246
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,800
Iran unfiltered

247
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,279
so good

248
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,360
just natural ingredients

249
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,940
you know high quality natural

250
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,880
ingredients just

251
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,380
there's so much better for you and

252
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,120
tastes so much better than anything you

253
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,920
can get in like a fast food restaurant

254
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,000
like this eggnog which I'm going to

255
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,760
teach you

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,680
literally tastes better than anything

257
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,180
you can find in any fast food restaurant

258
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,180
I promise you

259
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,800
all right

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,420
so milk mixture is on the heat

261
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,980
I mean wash my hands a little bit like

262
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,480
moss

263
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:54,860
we're gonna whisk these eggs so okay so

264
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,860
you basically okay

265
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,540
you know you're done when you see these

266
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,459
Peaks forming in the egg whites that's

267
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,320
perfect that's exactly what I'm looking

268
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,940
for

269
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
really really nice

270
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,899
okay so that's what I was talking about

271
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,300
like if you had a little bit of yolk in

272
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,980
the egg whites it wouldn't rise up as

273
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,100
much it's not a huge deal you're still

274
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,019
going to get the same nutrition oh boy

275
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,860
no I'm good

276
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,560
um

277
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,899
but this is just gonna be nicer I don't

278
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,480
know so okay egg whites have been

279
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,519
whisked and that's good it's ready to go

280
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,620
we have the yolks

281
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,600
yeah that's basically it all we're doing

282
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,540
is waiting for the milk

283
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,760
mine is just heating up slightly oh I

284
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:57,600
mean give you a warning so this

285
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,300
ingredient this eggnog has four eggs

286
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,700
and basically if you're not used to

287
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,399
eating eggs your body is going to have a

288
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,560
little bit of a reaction towards it

289
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,600
put to put it bluntly

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,519
the first two days of having a lot of

291
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,040
eggs your farts are going to smell like

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
sulfur because eggs contain sulfur

293
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,120
however your body's going to learn from

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,560
it and adapt to it and

295
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
there won't be any problems like you'll

296
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,600
be fine you'll be whoever you were

297
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,339
before consuming the eggs so in just a

298
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,779
just a warning

299
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,660
kind of gross I don't want to talk about

300
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,920
it in a cooking channel but you know

301
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,140
this is not a cooking channel this is

302
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,399
like nutrition well-being Etc

303
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,079
and

304
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,399
at some point I want to talk about other

305
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,540
topics on this channel also things like

306
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,399
you know

307
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,700
philosophy of warfare or something like

308
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,519
that like deep topics

309
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,779
anyway milk yes okay so next step we're

310
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,260
going to combine the ingredients

311
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,180
essentially so the egg white foam goes

312
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,279
into this hot milk

313
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,380
all of it can go in at the same time no

314
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,700
issue remember this contains the honey

315
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,700
so the honey is going in as well

316
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:11,100
get in there all right

317
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,640
yeah buddy

318
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,640
okay

319
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,579
so this is going to be I'm going to

320
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,860
combine this and then we have the egg

321
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,480
yolks we're going to break them

322
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,079
mix them up a little bit

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,660
put them in mix it mix it mix it mix it

324
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,779
mix it mix it mix it

325
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,040
put some into this mix this I'm just

326
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,740
trying to get all of it in because you

327
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,860
know this entire thing the yolks

328
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,579
especially are full of micronutrients

329
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,920
zinc magnesium selenium everything that

330
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:49,260
your body needs to secrete hormones so

331
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,480
this is literally the stuff which gets

332
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,339
converted into testosterone so you don't

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,779
want to waste a single drop of this

334
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,760
stuff

335
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,839
especially because this is expensive

336
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,820
like I bought the best quality

337
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,000
ingredients to make this thing so might

338
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,680
as well get every last drop

339
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,079
like these eggs like this carton of eggs

340
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,019
cost I think like seven dollars which

341
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,060
you know I happen to be blessed

342
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,639
and fortunate to be able to afford it

343
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,000
without too much concern but

344
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,000
no

345
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,839
um

346
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,639
hopefully you find yourself in

347
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,639
a fortunate situation such as myself

348
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,240
so yeah combine the ingredients

349
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,279
keep going keep going

350
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,380
I think it's probably combined enough

351
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,180
oh yeah I forgot so vanilla extract this

352
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,339
is the most optional ingredient in this

353
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,440
entire recipe it's a little bit of a

354
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,260
splash for taste

355
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,360
and make sure you don't get the

356
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,620
like the Kroger Brand like the cheapest

357
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,540
vanilla extract because usually those

358
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,860
are synthesized you want to at least

359
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,540
make sure that it's coming from an

360
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,540
actual plant

361
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,940
a lot of ingredients in our stores

362
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,639
they're all fake they're all just

363
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,740
terrible for your body not necessarily

364
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,880
the vanilla extract but you know other

365
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,200
things

366
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,700
so

367
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,260
that's what this channel is going to

368
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,060
kind of

369
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,380
he's trying to teach you

370
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,100
protect you from the harms of

371
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,380
industrialized food processes

372
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,600
essentially and you know make better

373
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,820
choices in the grocery store which

374
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,420
results in directly in better hormonal

375
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,519
Health which results in better

376
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,880
like mental health which increases your

377
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,740
productivity your financial status your

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,260
social status your dating life

379
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,540
everything goes up so we have this

380
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,060
mixture I think we have all the

381
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,500
ingredients combined very good now let

382
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,380
me grab

383
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,339
when these glass jars try not to use

384
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,620
plastic jars plastic jars will leech

385
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,420
chemicals into your food like literally

386
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,300
they leech microplastics and chemicals

387
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,420
into your food so no plastic

388
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,680
and then we have the mixture ready to go

389
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm going to hopefully not make an ass

390
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,399
of myself on camera

391
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
and pour this thing nice and clean

392
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,079
deep breathing guys keeps the stress

393
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,320
away right

394
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,240
yeah uh yeah let's go let's go let's go

395
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,600
almost almost

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,040
a little bit more in here but so

397
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,420
I guess I didn't calculate too well

398
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,699
right maybe maybe I should reduce the

399
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,920
milk a little bit I have more than what

400
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,899
one jar can contain

401
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,899
so that's fine I mean I have more jars

402
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,060
I have more jars

403
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,060
she has one

404
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,720
pour it in

405
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,980
and I also have

406
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,980
some leftover from a previous batch

407
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,100
so

408
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,459
yep yep yep there it is so

409
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,000
when do you serve this thing so after

410
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:08,459
you make it and I have like three jars

411
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,440
or two and a half jars of this stuff so

412
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,000
that's really good this is gonna like I

413
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,800
do one jar per day four eggs per day

414
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,579
that's it seems like the right amount

415
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,160
for me

416
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:18,300
and basically you want to chill this you

417
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,760
want to put in the freezer not the

418
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,380
freezer the fridge and it's going to

419
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,000
taste amazing overnight when you have it

420
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,500
the next morning but even if you chill

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,920
it for just an hour or two it's still

422
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,180
really good so what you'll do is

423
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,720
well

424
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,480
for the sake of b-roll and to make this

425
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,980
video you know comprehensive

426
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,440
I will

427
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,519
pour some and serve

428
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,519
let me grab

429
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,800
this they put these away

430
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,820
so let's go let's add let's have some

431
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,040
eggnog I mean it's not ideal because

432
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,240
it's still kind of warm ideally served

433
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,259
chilled but still gonna taste good

434
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,360
though

435
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,040
so let's go

436
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,040
eggnog here we go

437
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,660
oh yeah it's good it's good you can kind

438
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,559
of taste the honey

439
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:17,640
this is the ultimate

440
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:20,059
esoteric eggnog Elixir move these out to

441
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,640
get that front view

442
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:25,980
yeah buddy add some cinnamon

443
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,380
beautiful

444
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,059
and cinnamon has thermogenic effects so

445
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,440
essentially it's a fat burner

446
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,340
and

447
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,179
that is a drink fit for Kings

448
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,580
just look at that like look at that

449
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,919
compare your whey protein

450
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,460
milkshake to this thing

451
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,460
all right

452
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,799
let me oh yeah so I like to kind of stir

453
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,660
the cinnamon in

454
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,860
so that's up to you

455
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,860
let's see how this thing tastes

456
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,660
perfect

457
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,960
a little bit too much cinnamon I think

458
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,960
but

459
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,720
perfect so it's it's warm it's not you

460
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
know the right temperature it's not the

461
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,960
way it's supposed to be served so I'm

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,460
going to put it all in the fridge and

463
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,660
after a couple hours then I'm gonna have

464
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,240
it

465
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,220

anything like eggs it doesn't even taste

472
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,140
like milk really it tastes like custard

473
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,840

474
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,480
