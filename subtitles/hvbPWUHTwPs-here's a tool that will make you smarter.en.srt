1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,040
the 8020 rule states that 80% of the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,360
outcomes come from 20% of the causes it

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,440
works in theory but I found it hard to

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,759
use in practice the promise of the 8020

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,759
rule is that if you could figure out

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,840
just the 20% of the stuff that actually

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,359
matters you can get away by doing just

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,400
that however it's not that easy it's

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,720
hard to know what 20% is the right 20%

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,000
for example let's take any complex task

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,000
let's say I want to make a YouTube video

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,680
what's the 8020 on that is it the title

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
is it the thumbnail the hook is it the

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,280
camera is it the audio is it the actual

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
words I say is it my camera presence is

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,960
it the topic that I choose all of these

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
seem important if I was to impose the

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,800
8020 rule which of these would represent

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,640
that magic 20% that gets the result I

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,359
don't know I'll use another example

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,399
let's say we want to get into shape we

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,920
need gym membership we need maybe

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,519
supplements better food better sleep

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,120
like I can make a long list of things

25
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,320
which you need to get the physique that

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,920
you want the purpose of the 8020 rule is

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
to reduce complexity I think it does do

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,680
a good job of that except that I needed

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,439
a little bit more structure before I

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,479
could personally take the actionable

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,960
steps required to get outcomes at the

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,360
end of the day I only care about

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,960
outcomes I do not seek to entertain you

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,000
or even educate you I'm going to share

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,200
with you a quick and easy mental model

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,240
that serves me better than the 8020 rule

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,360
does I use something called the 93 rule

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,079
or simply The Big Three rule the 93 rule

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,960
states that 90% of the outcomes come

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,880
from the top three causes so another way

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,759
of stating it would be what three sub

42
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,040
problems do you need to solve in order

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,719
to solve the main problem let's do some

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,159
examples let's say I want to create a

45
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,640
YouTube video what three problems do I

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,640
need to solve it's going to be packaging

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
script and topic there are other things

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,600
to be sure like audio or video quality

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,360
but without these three nothing else

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,079
matters and here's the cool part The Big

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,039
Three rule is inherently hierarchical

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,880
and you can use it recursively I'll

53
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,879
explain what I mean by that what this

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,080
means is now you can hit the sub

55
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,360
problems with the big three Hammer again

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
to reveal these smaller sub problems

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480
which you can now solve what's the big

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,640
three on packaging oh it's thumbnail

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,400
it's title and the hook cool we can

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,360
solve those there's tutorials on YouTube

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,000
to make good thumbnails titles and hooks

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
what's the big three on the topic Choice

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
well again it's timeliness its

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,560
importance and its relevance to the

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
audience you can research and fix each

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,040
of these in order to solve the main

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
problem suddenly the strategy the action

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
steps become more clear to you because

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
you've broken the problem down into

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
manageable components now I take zero

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,120
credit for this rule I'm not sure when I

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,200
started using it but hey I thought it

73
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,360
was useful so now I'm giving it to you

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,360
you can even apply the big three rule to

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,000
behavior what's the big three on camera

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,280
presence okay it's eye contact it's it's

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,879
Clarity of speech and perhaps it's also

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
hand gestures right each of these is a

79
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,959
trainable Behavior each of these I can

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,599
train somebody to replicate now let's

81
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,720
apply this technique to an even bigger

82
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,319
question what makes a good Lifestyle the

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,599
triangle of lifestyle is health wealth

84
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,480
and relationships the big three on

85
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,440
health is nutrition exercise and

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,440
Recovery the big three on wealth is

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,000
going to be income investment and

88
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,120
spending the big three on relationships

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,480
is going to be friends family and female

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,159
attraction you can solve wealth if you

91
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,280
increase income increase investment and

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,680
decrease spending you have solved

93
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,000
relationships if you build friendships

94
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,959
have family ties and build female

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,599
attraction but now you're thinking well

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,640
it's easier said than done right exactly

97
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,720
I never said it would be easy I said it

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
would be simple those are not the same

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,319
things but the good thing is the big

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,599
three rule allows you to break things

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,280
down until you have a clear actionable

102
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,640
step so let's go into health I said the

103
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,000
first of the big three on health is

104
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,360
nutrition but what's the big three on

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
nutrition in other words what three

106
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,840
problems do you need to solve in order

107
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,920
to solve 90% of nutrition well you need

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,359
to answer what to eat you need to answer

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,079
how much to eat you need to answer when

110
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,800
to eat if you solve these three problems

111
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,400
you have solved nutrition let's do

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,320
another example what's the big three on

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,240
exercise it's consistency Progressive

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,199
overload and injury prevention if you do

115
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,759
these three you're good you'll 100% see

116
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,800
results if you just focus on these three

117
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,680
aspects of exercise now let's go to a

118
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,600
different part of this what's the big

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,240
three on income I'm a business owner so

120
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,280
for me it's going to be Marketing sales

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,800
and delivery as in I get people to see

122
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,479
who I am that's called marketing I show

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,840
people that I can solve a problem that

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
they have that's called sales and I

125
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,320
actually solve those problems that's

126
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,720
called delivery if I do do just these

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,440
three things at a high level I'm good I

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
don't have to worry about income if I

129
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,160
execute on these three aspects of income

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,080
at the same time if I [ __ ] up on any of

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,440
these then I'm screwed the big three

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,680
rule is derived from a method called me

133
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
which was created by the world's biggest

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,720
consulting company called McKenzie it

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,960
stands for mutually exclusive

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,520
collectively exhaustive let's talk about

137
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,240
the mutually exclusive part mutually

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,000
exclusive means that there are no

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
crossovers between the sub Parts when

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,680
you break down the hole in the ideal

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
case each subpart is its own problem

142
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,880
that does not interact with other

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,520
problems now this isn't always perfect

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,560
for example if you break down Health

145
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,160
into nutrition exercise and Recovery you

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,080
of course know that a bad diet can

147
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,199
affect exercise and bad exercise can

148
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
affect recovery just because there are

149
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,520
some crossovers doesn't mean you can't

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,520
use the rule just be smart and try to

151
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,280
minimize not eliminate these

152
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,680
interactions the second part is

153
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,759
collectively exhaustive collectively

154
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,600
exhaustive means that if the subp parts

155
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,160
of the hole are added up they represent

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,240
100% of the hole this is where the big

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
three rule diverges from the traditional

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,120
me method the traditional me method

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,680
requires that the hole is broken down

160
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,240
into as many parts as it takes until we

161
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,599
can be sure that the parts can be added

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
up to recreate the hole for the kind of

163
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,680
Consulting work that mckenzi does this

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,880
makes a lot of sense but for what we are

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,080
going to use this for we don't need all

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,560
the parts let me explain this is because

167
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,360
most complexity follows a power law

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,120
distribution meaning when you start

169
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,240
breaking down a problem the first chunk

170
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,319
represents a very large part of the

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,599
initial problem the second chunk might

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
be big as well but it is smaller than

173
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,680
the first the third chunk is a bit

174
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,360
smaller but still significant the fourth

175
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,840
chunk the fifth chunk and so on are

176
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
going to be smaller and smaller and

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,039
smaller they're going to matter less and

178
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
less so I'd rather focus on the big

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,879
three that I need to get right and then

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
I can move on to the smaller problems me

181
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,080
requires you to get all the chunks but

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the big three rule requires that you

183
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
find just the biggest three chunks

184
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,160
that's the difference even so there is a

185
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,720
potential problem that you will face how

186
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,360
many recursions of the big three rule do

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,560
you need to do now what do I mean by

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,000
that when we had health as a complex

189
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,319
topic we broke it down into nutrition

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,960
exercise and Recovery when we broke

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,599
exercise I broke it down into

192
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,400
consistency Progressive overload and

193
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,080
injury prevention but even these are too

194
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
big there's too much complexity it

195
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,280
doesn't lead to an actionable step we

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,160
need to keep breaking it down we break

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,160
it down until we reach actionable steps

198
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,199
for example let's break down consistency

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,240
what is consistency it means essentially

200
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,199
you're working out for weeks and months

201
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,000
and years if we break that down we

202
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,639
realize we're already consistent with

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
many habits we brush our teeth every day

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,759
we shower every day and most of us pull

205
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,400
up Instagram or social media every day

206
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,039
here's the cool part all of these are

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,159
learned behaviors you learn to brush

208
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,440
your teeth consistently because your

209
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,919
parents provided you the accountability

210
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,639
when you were little we shower

211
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,159
consistently because we don't want to be

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,599
seen as a smelly person in other words

213
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,840
we want hygiene to be a part of our

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
identity we get on Instagram

215
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
consistently because the app is designed

216
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,400
in a way to inject a reward into our

217
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
brain if we apply the big three

218
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,479
consistency breaks down into

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,319
accountability identity and reward now

220
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,960
we have something we can work with now

221
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,759
we have the ingredients to create a

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,159
system that delivers each of these now

223
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
we have something that we can bring

224
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,320
change not only to ourselves but to

225
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,240
others is using such principles that I

226
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,399
have created Crusade now coming back to

227
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,360
the big three rule why does it work as

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,120
Julius Caesar said DV day at impera

229
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,959
divide and conquer essentially The Big

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,000
Three rule allows you to divide and

231
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,360
conquer your problems in the same way

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,320
that Julius Caesar divided and conquered

233
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,000
Gaul which as you know culminated in the

234
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,560
Epic Siege at Alysia when Caesar was

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,839
besieging the GS he was in turn besieged

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,200
by the GS it was a double encirclement

237
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,240
there was the GS in the center Caesar

238
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,000
surrounded them and then he himself was

239
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,000
surrounded by a huge Army of GS in this

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,519
terrible position where you have enemies

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,800
on the inside and the outside Caesar

242
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,920
decided that there was three things that

243
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,320
he could not let slip otherwise it all

244
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,680
goes to [ __ ] number one was the

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,959
fortifications of the Legion if the

246
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,800
walls broke the legion would be crushed

247
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,360
number two was the supplies if Caesar

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,279
didn't have supplies we didn't manage

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,519
Logistics he would be killed by

250
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,160
starvation instead of Spears the third

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,680
was the morale of the troops Caesar

252
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,160
himself led the charge in the fighting

253
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,000
because he knew that his presence would

254
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,040
light the troops on fire and they would

255
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,160
not back down so long as he doesn't back

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,760
down if you read the GIC Wars Caesar

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,320
used the big twe rule be like Caesar

258
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,680
sadly we are 2,000 years too late to

259
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,720
join Caesar's Legion but hey you might

three on driving a car safely well it's

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,440
obvious reasons it's going to be the

277
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,920
quality of your clothes again for

278
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
obvious reasons and it's going to be

279
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,200
congruence as in the style should be

280
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,839
congruent with your persona I wear well

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,079

t-shirts or Street Wear it's not that

291
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040

292
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,440
