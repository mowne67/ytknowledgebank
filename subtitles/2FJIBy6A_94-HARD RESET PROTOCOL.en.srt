1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
if you already have momentum in your

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,540
life if you're already heading towards

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,099
your goal trip already destroyed your

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,559
limiting beliefs and your addictions

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,480
then this is not the video for you this

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,519
video is for two types of people the

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,920
first if you're stuck in a rut if you're

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,500
finding yourself in an endless cycle of

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,199
pointless pain and self-sabotage then

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,720
you need the hard reset protocol to

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,060
break that cycle as a pattern interrupt

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,920
and set you on A New Path and the second

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,380
group of people is those people who have

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,360
a path but they're just going too slow

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,399
or perhaps they have lost their

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,140
Direction along the way if you have lost

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,640
your focus and your purpose then the

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,219
hard reset protocol is going to help you

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,780
get back on track and reignite the flame

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,640
that kept you going in the first place

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,680
do you know that quote if you get one

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,860
percent every day at the end of the year

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,680
you're 37 times better this is the wrong

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,899
way of looking at things yes it's a

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,780
mathematical truth but has no relevance

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,719
to your life you see progress in life is

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,180
not a linear function nor is it an

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,240
exponential function it's more of a step

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,340
function it's very untidy you can and I

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
have and hundreds of people have changed

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,659
the trajectory of their life based on

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,960
one event or one day the hard reset

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,760
protocol forces a step function forces a

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,400
Divergence in your life it gives you a

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,220
chance to stop reassess and then move

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,040
imagine if you're a Spanish explorator

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,960
lost in the woods of the Amazon forest

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,580
trying to find the golden city of El

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,619
Dorado and you've been walking in

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,360
circles you're lost and there's a pebble

41
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,159
in your boot so what should you do right

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,400
now should you just continue to walk in

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,380
circles hoping for the best in pain or

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,659
should you stop take out the pebble from

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,840
your boot look at your Maps take stock

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,400
of your resources chart a path towards

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
the goal and make a deliberate move

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,720
forward obviously that's what you should

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,360
do but most people will go about their

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,000
lives in pain going around in circles

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,159
without taking stock of the resources

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,280
without taking a pause without looking

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,259
at themselves objectively and charting a

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,719
course for the best possible outcome

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,280
this is why I created the hard reset

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,599
protocol I created this years ago

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
actually I've been using it for years

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,020
I've created by looking at the great

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,940
minds of History I've looked at the

60
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,860
psychology of the human brain I've

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,780
looked at military history I've looked

62
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,560
at culture and tradition to come up with

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,420
the ideal hard reset protocol through

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,819
which you can change the trajectory of

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,739
your life but I will give you a word of

66
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,959
caution this is not going to be for

67
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,239
everybody and even if you do manage to

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,760
do it you should absolutely not do it

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,459
more than two to three times per year

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,920
this is a powerful tool which is only to

71
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,300
be used very strategically before we get

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,980
started I give you the exact actionable

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,959
steps there are five rules that you must

74
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,920
follow rule number one you have to take

75
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,720
this seriously and you have to be

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,220
intentional about it otherwise the brain

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,540
rewiring is not going to happen and

78
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,800
you're just wasting your time rule

79
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,540
number two I've already said you can

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,000
only do this twice or Thrice maybe

81
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,400
maximum four times per year number three

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,379
you have to set aside time for this at

83
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,239
least five hours ideally the whole day

84
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,739
number four you must complete every part

85
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,360
of this protocol in order for it to be

86
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,860
effective number five you must be in a

87
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,780
completely fasted state for you to do

88
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,879
this you'll have no food for the

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,200
duration of the hard reset protocol you

90
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,120
can of course have electrolytes you can

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,739
have water and I have a video talking

92
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,540
about electrolytes but you cannot have

93
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,819
any solid food the hard reset protocol

94
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,019
is four steps and each step has some sub

95
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,220
steps within it I'm going to give you

96
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,140
the exact instructions in the

97
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,239
description below the first step is for

98
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,099
you to buzz your hair I already know

99
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,300
you're having resistance even hearing

100
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,140
the thought you've already decided

101
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,060
you're not going to do it you're going

102
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,340
to go to step two three and four but

103
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,560
hear me out very carefully what if every

104
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,599
military on the face of the Earth from

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,700
the beginning of History insists that

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,220
their trainees have their heads shaved

107
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,340
from the hopletase of Sparta to the

108
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,400
hastati of Rome from the philangitase of

109
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,400
Alexander to the modern U.S army all

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,560
trainees always have their heads shaved

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,260
or trimmed or buzzed and what if every

112
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,819
single Monastery of any religion insists

113
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,099
that their acolytes have their heads

114
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,840
shaped why in the movie Fight Club does

115
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,780
Tyler Durden insist that his space

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,000
monkeys have their heads buzzed

117
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,760
to some extent this is because in all

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,400
these organizations you have to earn the

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,260
right to have hair you have to earn the

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
right to look good and express yourself

121
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,699
it's because you're submitting to

122
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,740
yourself to a time of rewiring and

123
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,320
transformation the only people exempt

124
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,759
from this rule are Sikhs and women if

125
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,220
you want to do the hard reset protocol

126
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,620
you start with buzzing your hair you

127
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,139
need to destroy your vanity and you need

128
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,580
to destroy your ego now you can do this

129
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,139
yourself if you have a pair of flippers

130
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,940
or you can go to the barber I don't care

131
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,759
you're doing this for Spiritual

132
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,259
metaphysical and practical reasons this

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,000
is not the time for you to look your

134
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,440
best and woo all the women and flirt

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,759
with all the chicks and all this this is

136
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,699
not the time for that this is the time

137
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,500
for you to get to work and another added

138
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,240
bonus is if you watched my hair care

139
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,800
video you know that there's a benefit to

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,900
buzzing your hair and then resetting the

141
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,100
cycle and not using shampoo and instead

142
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,740
of using shampoo you should be using

143
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,300
non-toxic non-drying option A herbal

144
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,940
option which I'll link in my Amazon

145
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,380
store below now we go on to step two but

146
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,300
you have to understand you have have to

147
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,100
do step one step one is not optional you

148
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,020
have to buzz your hair and you only go

149
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,340
to step two once you're done with step

150
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,259
one of course you can listen to the

151
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,360
whole video and then enact the hard

152
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:22,440
reset protocol step two you're gonna

153
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,020
bring to life your heaven and your hell

154
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,360
what you'll do is you'll put all your

155
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,699
devices in airplane mode you'll clear

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,800
your desk the only thing on your desk is

157
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,440
a piece of paper and a pen to write with

158
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,120
you're gonna sit down and stare at the

159
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,220
wall in front of you this is not

160
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,139
meditation I don't want you to meditate

161
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,780
this is not the time for mindfulness and

162
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,240
spirituality this is a time for you to

163
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,340
really suffer and feel the pain of

164
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,740
boredom feel the pain of negative

165
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,020
emotions and thoughts in your head let

166
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,300
the demons begin their offensive for you

167
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,180
are in control you are chained to your

168
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,880
desk you will not leave this place until

169
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,680
this task is done you can stand up you

170
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,539
can move a little bit just for the blood

171
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,699
circulation but you are not going to

172
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,740
move away from your desk until this task

173
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,120
is done as you're sitting down on your

174
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,979
desk with your piece of paper and your

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,600
pen the negative thoughts and emotions

176
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,460
are going to come at you you'll think

177
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,320
thoughts of how worthless you are you

178
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,720
will think thoughts of how you deserve

179
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,460
to end up lonely you'll think thoughts

180
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,780
of why not just go and watch porn you

181
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,759
have to understand you might be sitting

182
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,639
here for an hour you might be sitting

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,319
for two hours you're going to let these

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,720
negative emotions seep through your

185

brain they're going to find the way to

189
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,680
apply leverage in order to make you move

190
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,660
and do something anything other than

191
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,160
face them head on they'll tell you to be

192
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,360
productive they'll say you're just

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,819
sitting down and you're wasting your

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,220
time why not go and reply to the emails

195
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,500
why not reply to those DMS why not make

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,600
money why not do this and that why not

198
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,660
timetable the schedule for the rest of

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,580
your week so many things that you could

200
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,259
be doing but you're just sitting here if

201
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,940
that doesn't work they're gonna hit you

202
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,400
with the pictures of you know past

203
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,500
girlfriends regrets things you fumbled

204
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,120
businesses that didn't go anywhere

205
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,460
arguments that you've had with your

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,740
parents all the negative garbage must

207
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,539
come out for you to purge I told you get

208
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,280
a piece of paper and a pen I haven't

209
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,080
told you to start writing yet so listen

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,639
you're going to be sitting down you're

211
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,280
going to let these negative thoughts

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,259
come to you and then when these negative

213
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,020
emotions have reached their Crescendo

214
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,240
that's when you begin your offensive

215
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,580
that's when you use your pen and your

216
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,560
paper as your tools against this enemy

217
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,300
you see I told you not to use a laptop I

218
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,800
told you to use a piece of paper and a

219
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,800
pen the reason for this is I want your

220
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,780
concentration not to be diffused among

221
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,080
all your fingers on a keyboard I want it

222
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,819
to be concentrated and packed into the

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,520
tip of that pen and when you start

224
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,539
writing you are framing your future this

225
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,060
is what you're going to write you're

226
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,960
going to have two pages one your title

227
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,419
as hell and the other as Heaven first we

228
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,759
start in hell you are going to give life

229
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,520
to your hell all the negative thoughts

230
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,500
that you've had all the bad Futures that

231
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,300
you can potentially see I want you to

232
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,180
write down your worst nightmares and

233
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,639
worst fears make it as detailed and

234
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,680
graphic and emotionally painful as

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,060
possible this is not going to be easy I

236
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,319
know because I just recently did this

237
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,580
you can see from my hair that I've

238
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,460
already gone through a hard reset

239
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,340
protocol myself my health is failing

240
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,220
this Gambit this gamble I've taken on

241
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,599
making a YouTube business my hell is not

242
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,760
being able to retire my parents because

243
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,680
I decided to take a Gamble and go for

244
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,440
YouTube instead of my fancy engineering

245
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,599
job my health is being alone never

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
having a Brotherhood of like-minded

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,500
young men my hell is never finding the

248
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,959
right girl to start a family with my

249
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,480
hell is never breaking free from the

250
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,279
great game and always being a pawn of

251
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,620
Corporations and government I write

252
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,839
these things in extreme detail I want to

253
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,240
be anxious about this I want to feel

254
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,160
fear I want to feel the shame that I

255
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,899
would feel if I was to go to my parents

256
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,300
and say I couldn't succeed in my

257
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,459
business because too unfocused to do the

258
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,800
effort I want to feel the loneliness

259
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,839
that I would feel if I was to never have

260
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,959
a Brotherhood of like-minded men and

261
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,480
once I'm done with creating my hell I

262
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,820
get up off my desk move around a little

263
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,220
bit get my circulation back I come back

264
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,560
I have my pen I remind myself that the

265
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,360
forces of hell can do me no harm but the

266
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,519
forces of Heaven are with me I remind

267
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,980
myself that the smallest flame can

268
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,500
dispel any Darkness I remind myself that

269
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,980
in my life I am the light in the dark

270
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,620
that I am order amidst chaos and I

271
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,680
remind myself that my character is my

272
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,540
destiny and now I write my vision of

273
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,820
Heaven I write what happens when

274
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,339
everything goes according to plan I

275
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,260
write of a golden future this YouTube

276
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,080
channel has reached tens of thousands of

277
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,820
lives I have rid the minds of hundreds

278
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,620
and thousands of young men and women of

279
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,440
psychological operations have purged

280
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,660
their bodies of toxins and xenoestrogens

281
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,880
I have cut the puppet strings of

282
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,860
corporations in government I've launched

283
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,420
my private Community the country club

284
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,279
and I'm teaching hundreds of people

285
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,500
everything there is to know about health

286
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm giving them a classical education

287
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,339
which they were denied in the modern

288
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,800
education system I'm even teaching them

289
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,600
how to set up their own synthesizer

290
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
business on YouTube so that they can be

291
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
financially free and as my business

292
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
grows I'm able to retire my parents I'm

293
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,339
able to live a comfortable life maybe at

294
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
some point I find a pretty girl save her

295
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,360
from her soul sucking nine to five and

296
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,360
whisk her off to Tuscany but whatever

297
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,760
your vision of Hell In Heaven is that's

298
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,399
what you write down be detailed be

299
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,200
articulate be even poetic be dramatic

300
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,779
you're a human being filled with life

301
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,180
and creativity let that be shown on

302
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,279
these pages does your vision of Heaven

303
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,019
include travel write down the places you

304
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,060
want to visit write down how it would be

305
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,519
to be in those places the temperature

306
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,800
the smell of street food in the air if

307
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,079
you want to meet a woman describe her

308
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,839
the sway of her hips the color of her

309
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,640
eyes make this real the more real you

310
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,320
can make this the more emotional

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,899
resonance it's going to have with you

312
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
and more power the hard reset protocol

313
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,320
is going to have overall in your life

314
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,060
once you're done with your writing of

315
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,279
your hell in heaven you're ready to move

316
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,260
on to step number three of the hard

317
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,820
reset protocol now just before I go on

318
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,019
to that if you want a guideline as to

319
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,420
how much you should write you should

320
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,700
write at least one page for hell one

321
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,660
paid for heaven ideally more but that

322
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
doesn't mean you have to write a whole

323
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,260
last novel right maybe one to two pages

324
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,839
is what you should be aiming for now

325
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,459
step number three is the rules I'm going

326
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,779
to give you five rules that you must

327
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,680
follow and what you're going to do is

328
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,760
you're going to take another piece of

329
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,579
paper and you're going to write these

330
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,000
rules word for word what I'm saying rule

331
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,920
one I reject my addictions for my dreams

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,680
are more important than any Temptation

333
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,320
rule number two I will not numb myself

334
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,019
with entertainment for I have no time

335
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,120
for mediocrity rule number three I will

336
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,880
meditate for 30 minutes every day so

337
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,220
that my mind is worthy of wisdom rule

338
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,260
number four I will engage in at least 30

339
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,899
minutes of exercise per day so that my

340
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,300
body is worthy of my mind rule number

341
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,640
five I will read these rules and my

342
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,860
version of hell and heaven every morning

343
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,300
to remind me of what's at stake these

344
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,740
are the five golden rules that are going

345
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,839
to set you apart from everybody else

346
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,940
most people don't have any rules in

347
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,100
their life you have these five rules you

348
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,420
adhere to these five rules and you tell

349
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,560
me it doesn't make a change in your life

350
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,060
so very briefly I'm going to explain

351
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,279
exactly what the rules are rule number

352
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,959
one says no addictions so no porn no

353
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,220
drugs no alcohol none of that if you

354
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,660
need help with breaking addictions then

355
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,760
I have a video on exactly how to do that

356
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,279
rule 2 says no entertainment so no Tick

357
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,140
Tock no Instagram no YouTube now you can

358
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,000
use YouTube for educational purposes but

359
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,160
you have to install the extensions the

360
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,480
browser extensions which Hamza is going

361
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,639
to recommend in this video which I'm

362
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,500
going to link in the description which

363
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
basically makes it such that YouTube is

364
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,980
only for educational purposes rule 3

365
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,420
says meditation for 30 minutes this

366
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,220
doesn't have to be 30 minutes in one

367
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,779
stretch it can be broken up into Parts

368
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,000
throughout the day but it does have to

369
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,440
add up to 30 minutes overall if you

370
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,260
don't know how to meditate that's fine

371
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,000
just literally sit just sit don't even

372
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,800
meditate but you have to do this for 30

373
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
minutes and of course I will come out

374
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,579
with a meditation guide soon enough so

375
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,200
you'll know how to do meditation in a

376
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,279
very small amount of time maybe if you

377
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,380
want to hit the Bell button to be

378
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,940
notified you can do that rule 4 says to

379
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,800
do exercise for at least 30 minutes this

380
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,680
can be anything weight lifting running

381
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,260
BJJ I don't care Rule 5 says You must

382
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,180
read your rules and read your

383
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,560
description of Hell In Heaven every

384
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,260
single day in the morning this is

385
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,480
actually a very very underrated rule you

386
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,700
can do all this emotional work all this

387
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,200
mental effort to create these documents

388
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,180
you see these are your foundational

389
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,500
documents but if you don't read them and

390
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,480
you don't have them in your mind every

391
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,220
day there's no point in putting in all

392
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,320
this effort and time I want you to treat

393
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,540
these documents as an Irreplaceable

394
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,519
asset this is not just a piece of paper

395
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,500
with writing on it you have put your

396
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,000
heart and soul and Imagination into this

397
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,880
so every morning when you read these

398
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,940
painful words of hell and these amazing

399
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,800
inspiring words of Heaven it has to have

400
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,360
an emotional resonance with you and

401
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,220
that's what's going to get you to

402
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,500
perform at the highest level every day

403
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,820
you have to read it especially when you

404
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,380
don't want to some days you're going to

405
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,200
feel so motivated that you don't feel

406
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,240
like you need to this is a trick played

407
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,560
by your mind read it and some days

408
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
you're going to be so depressed and

409
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,860
inactive that you don't want to read it

410
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
it's painful to even read it I don't

411
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,880
care you still have to read it and

412
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,959
finally step four step four is going to

413
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,399
take you the least amount of time but

414
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,579
it's going to be the most important step

415
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,740
you see your step four is a risk step

416
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,360
four your honor is at stake you see

417
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,639

418
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,680
promises that you've made and kept not

419
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,779
