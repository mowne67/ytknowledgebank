1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,600
when people realized that I was in the

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,480
army they asked me if that's why my

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,839
posture was so good but that was never

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,320
the case the Army doesn't really care

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,000
about posture that much even in

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
formation the Army doesn't really care

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,240
about posture that much this is in North

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,000
Korea you know but you know who does

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,720
care about posture ballroom dance so I

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,840
took lessons in walz Fox Trot Tango

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,279
couple other dances and they are

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,880
extremely strict with posture and I was

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,359
never the best dancer by any means but I

14
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,320
got quite a few ribbons and that's

15
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,719
because of POS posture and because I

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,440
cheated to improve my posture about

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,160
everybody else and if postural

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,920
Improvement was the only thing I got

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,840
from ballroom dance it would absolutely

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,840
still be worth it even if you negate all

21
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,280
these social benefits of which there are

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,600
many this video is going to be extremely

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,160
actionable I'm going to give you the top

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,480
20% things which improve my posture and

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
this is because most people don't know

26
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,600
this but posture is a skill and a very

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,480
high Roi skill at that it will pay

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
dividends for years to come I'm not

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
talking about okay it makes you

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
attractive to women or makes you more

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,039
confident seeming let's that's fine I'm

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
talking about straight up biological and

33
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,720
health benefits I also want to remark

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
that just because you lift or you go to

35
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,840
the gym doesn't mean that you're not

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,080
living a sary lifesty what I mean by

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,680
that is if you spend most of your day

38
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,520
sitting behind a desk looking at the

39
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,200
computer and you spend 1 hour of your

40
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,720
day lifting that's not going to

41
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,960
counteract the effects so even if you

42
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,799
have a desk job man try to make the

43
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,479
effort to get up and move around every

44
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,479
20 minutes at least so I know what the

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,960
hell I'm talking about regarding this

46
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,920
subject because I actually had a

47
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
postural problem like a serious postural

48
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,159
problem called lumbar lordosis it's also

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
called like swe back it's also called

50
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,920
having a duck butt literally so this

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,399
happened during my first year of college

52
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,240
so first year of college was a disaster

53
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,280
man like I had a great high school I had

54
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,520
a great college experience after my

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,159
first year but I did not have a first

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,560
good year of college because it was bad

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,680
time for me man so I didn't know what

58
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,040
the hell I was doing I don't know why I

59
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,119
was in college in the first place I

60
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,600
didn't have any friends I didn't have a

61
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,759
Social Circle so I fell into a deep

62
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,280
addiction for video games so I was spent

63
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,880
like 10 hours plus per day playing Rome

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
Total War which is like a strategy game

65
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,520
and by the end of the year Year my spine

66
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,039
like my actual back was curved my butt

67
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,599
was sticking out and my my abs were

68
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,399
distended because that was just a result

69
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,160
of playing video games in a bad posture

70
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
for basically a year but at some point

71
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,840
in the end of the year my computer broke

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,040
down which was a godsend cuz I couldn't

73
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,599
play the video games anymore I was

74
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,760
forced to confront what I had created

75
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
for myself so within 6 months I had

76
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
actually completely fixed my lumbar Lord

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,160
Doses and you're going to learn exactly

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,760
how I did it so in dance posture is very

79
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,519
important you are literally given points

80
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,840
or deducted points based on posture so

81
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,200
if you wear a back brace while you're

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,720
dancing and if you calibrate the like

83
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,800
the straps length correctly you can hold

84
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,239
a very nice solid frame effortlessly and

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,959
this this actually very challenging in

86
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
dance to hold this frame for a long

87
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,840
duration but if you're riding a back bra

88
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,599
it's pretty easy so just because of that

89
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,040
one reason and of course because my

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,159
partners were really talented in their

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,599
own right I got all these ribbons like I

92
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,480
got one for Waltz this one's for foxtrot

93
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,840
I think these two are for Tang and a

94
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,720
couple other dances as well but

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,879
regardless let's get back on topic right

96
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,799
so this is a back phrase wear it for no

97
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,920
more than 3 hours per day and what

98
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,480
you're going to do is you're going to go

99
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,640
for nice leisurely walks in the outdoors

100
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
in nature every single day for at least

101
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,760
10 minutes and that's your point number

102
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,280
two go for walks man and I'm not talking

103
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,560
about for burning calories or for

104
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,480
Fitness or anything like that though of

105
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,640
course those are benefits I'm talking

106
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,280
about going on Long leisurely walks for

107
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
the purposes of relaxation so that you

108
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
are actually receptive to ideas and

109
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,159
that's the key point so where do you

110
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,959
think good ideas come from you think the

111
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,640
best scientists of our history are sad

112
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,239
behind Des trying to get good ideas no

113
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,799
if you read biographies of great

114
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,519
scientists and discoveries by great

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,560
inventors almost always they say that

116
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,680
the idea came to them whole almost like

117
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,720
a divine inspiration and this is only

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
possible if you're receptive to those

119
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,840
kinds of thoughts and for me the easiest

120
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
way to become receptive is going on a

121
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,799
walk you're not taking your phone with

122
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
you you're not taking your notification

123
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,400
ations you have a notebook and a pencil

124
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,400
with you and you are just going for a

125
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
walk could be 10 minutes could be 1 hour

126
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
and what you're doing is you're being

127
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
mindful of your breathing and you're

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
being mindful of your posture and if

129
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,599
you're writing a back brace as you're

130
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
walking you're going to basically train

131
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,239
your body to have an upright walking

132
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
posture it's going to become a habit so

133
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,079
this brace is basically it's um

134
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,120
stretching my chest muscles and it's

135
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
stretching my front delts which are

136
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,320
tight and it's causing the activation of

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
my lower trapezius muscles all things

138
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
which are good for overall posture but

139
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,039
then again I'm saying like you don't

140
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,479
need to be dependent on this no more

141
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,039
than 3 hours per day and yeah it's very

142
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,320
cheap very easy to get and three is to

143
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,560
do those walks while wearing barefoot

144
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,560
shoes so I have with myself my barefoot

145
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,919
shoes so the thing about these is

146
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,680
there's no rise so so rise is the angle

147
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,080
of the sole of the shoe and when you

148
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,280
have zero rise you're basically allowing

149
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
your Achilles tendon and your calves to

150
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,680
function as they're supposed to as shock

151
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,240
absorbers most modern Footwear have a

152
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,400
rise which means that they have a big

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,080
heel and a small toe box which kind of

154
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
forces your feet to be in an incline and

155
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,600
this puts more stress on your knees and

156
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
hip joints you don't want that obviously

157
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,160
so I'll make a separate video on

158
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,919
barefoot shoes and in fact how to fix

159
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,039
flat feet and you can watch that

160
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
separate video but as for right now I'll

161
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,840
link in the description to the Barefoot

162
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,880
shoe brand that I recommend you can

163
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
check it out if you so please changing

164
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,800

165
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,720
Boon for your postural health and

166
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
overall health in general man highly

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,039
recommend it's just a matter of buying

168
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
an equipment you you don't even have to

169
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,240
have discipline or anything just by

170
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,639
buying better Footwear you're going to

171
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,840
improve your lower body posture and the

172
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,039
third point is barefoot running or

173
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,080
jogging so go out into the open on

174
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,960
grassy Fields start running without

175
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,800
shoes on your body has all the knowledge

176
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,520
it needs for good posture I don't have

177
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,280
to be sat here teaching you anything

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
because your instincts are already there

179
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,440
as soon as you start running jogging or

180
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,479
walking barefoot on grass Millennia old

181
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,520
instincts will kick in to teach you how

182
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,240
to maintain good posture I'm talking

183
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,720
