1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,799
what's up bro come on in hey

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:12,800
I never hit out without my New York City

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,800
hot outside I urge every New Yorker

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,380
doubt

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,019
aren't you happy that Our Benevolent and

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,539
kind and all-knowing government put

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,099
fluoride in our water aren't you happy

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,320
they found such a good use for

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,719
Industrial Waste sure it might build up

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,760
in our brains but at least it keeps our

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,280
teeth safe right

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,660
at a bar and a guy comes up to you in a

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,219
white lab coat and sprinkles something

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,440
into your drink and you ask him hey what

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,719
are you doing and he tells you he's from

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,040
the government and he's here to help he

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,200
says despite the fact that Florida

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,879
accumulates in your pineal gland in your

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,340
brain and despite the fact that there

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,980
seems to be a link between lower IQ and

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,860
fluoride it's still okay because it's

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,440
good for your teeth he says that the CDC

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,539
labeled water fluoridation to be one of

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,780
the greatest Health achievements of the

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,240
20th century the same CDC who have deep

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,040
grievance with you see when the pandemic

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,500
reads across the U.S and across the

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,900
globe the CDC had data showing that

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,520
obesity rates were strongly linked to

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,740
fatalities caused by that disease

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,140
however they did not try to raise

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,180
awareness about that at all they could

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,860
have had a campaign saying that obesity

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,200
is strongly linked to that disease which

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,479
I shall not name and that they should

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,640
reduce obesity rates and as a way to

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,759
fight against the disease but it chose

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,400
not to do that instead they promoted

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,460
regulation which caused the shutdown and

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,799
the bankruptcy of your small business

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,820
diabetes obesity and cancer rates the

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,159
government didn't do much of anything

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,720
regarding all of these but two Decay is

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,140
the one thing they care about they did

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,360
huge multi-year multi-city studies

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,619
studying tooth decay and water

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,720
fluoridation

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,700
they could have spent those resources

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,560
trying to figure out the root cause of

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,720
the increase in truth Decay they could

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,700
have realized is the high fructose corn

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,439
syrup and the carb intake and the sugar

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,539
intake which is causing this new

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
epidemic of tooth decay but they didn't

55
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,560
do all that instead they decided they

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,959
would solve the problem not by removing

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,239
the additives which are high fructose

58
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,700
corn syrup and refined sugars instead

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
they added a new additive fluoride to

60
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,319
try to fix the problem this goes against

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
everything the esoteric Health movement

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,180
stands for the esoteric Health movement

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,620
stands for a return to tradition to

64
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,319
return to the things that we know that

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,000
work and a removal of additives which

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,819
cause more harm than good you know you

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,220
have a successful psyop but instead of a

68
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,519
rational approach to your legitimate

69
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,940
concerns you get a irrational and

70
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,260
fearful and even angry response so the

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,300
fear against fluoride is completely

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,680
legitimate I'm just thinking you know

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,560
why should the government be adding

74
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,300
additives for medication purposes Mass

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,819
medication is not something to be taken

76
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,379
trivially but yet whenever anybody

77
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,599
raises any concern against water

78
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,760
fluoridation that immediately labeled as

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,739
a crank conspiracy theorist that

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,720
immediately dismissed out of fear and

81
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,040
misunderstanding why I mean think about

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,360
this most people all they know about

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
fluoride is the government says it's

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,440
good for your teeth so if you question

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,700
that narrative you question perhaps it

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,739
may not be that good for our teeth in

87
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,180
the first place number one and two it

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,620
might have other effects which have

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,780
nothing to do with teeth and instead

90
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,580
have to do with the brain the immediate

91
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,000
response for the most of the general

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,159
public is going to be well what else am

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
I thinking what else am I assuming which

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,519
is actually Incorrect and this causes

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,620
unease this causes a breakdown of

96
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,819
assumptions it's like when you pull a

97
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,680
car down from the bottom of the

98
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,900
cardstack and then Tire stack comes

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,580
crumbling down that's what happens when

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,860
it comes to talking about water

101
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,780
fluoridation it's such a foundational

102
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,819
thing that we think about when you think

103
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,280
about public health efforts and to

104
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,680
undermine that undermines all of Public

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,180
Health and this is why there's so much

106
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,799
resistance against talking about this

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,299
topic not that that's going to stop me

108
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,620
though but I want to reiterate that this

109
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,140
channel has never been about spreading

110
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,700
propaganda or fear or anything like that

111
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,900
the fact of the matter is I have some

112
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,159
facts which I want to share with you I

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,019
have some insights which I want to share

114
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,939
with you observations which I've made

115
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,620
you can make up your own mind and I'll

116
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,540
give you mitigation strategies which I

117
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,299
have used and I recommend fear and

118
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,580
mistrust of the overlords or the Puppet

119
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,199
Masters The Matrix Etc is completely

120
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,240
useless you aren't going to be able to

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,880
make a massive change in those

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,520
constructions those entrenched forces

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,800
what you can do is affect your daily

124
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,139
life your friends and Family's daily

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
life and that's all I'm recommending to

126
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,800
arrive at the conclusion that I'm

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,220
arriving to I use What's called the psy

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,320
op method science intuition observation

129
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,820
and philosophy so first let's look at

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,340
what the science has to say two things

131
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,020
pique my curiosity first that fluoride

132
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,060
is known to accumulate in the pineal

133
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,040
gland second that there seems to be a

134
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,900
link between lower IQ among among the

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,639
children born from women exposed to

136
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,620
fluoride as compared to women who are

137
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,080
not exposed to fluoride looking first as

138
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,520
the pineal gland issue we barely

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,780
understand the pineal gland how we

140
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,500
barely understand the brain in general

141
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,120
so what is going on here it seems that

142
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,580
calcification happens due to a variety

143
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,340
of reasons including just a normal part

144
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,220
of aging but the fluoride the fluoride

145
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,740
goes ahead and uses the existing calcium

146
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,720
to bind to and now we have not only the

147
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,300
calcification of the pineal gland but

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,220
also a buildup of fluoride in fact the

149
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,780
most fluoride saturated organ of the

150
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,759
body is not the teeth or bones it's

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,259
actually the pineal gland which boggles

152
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,940
the mind it's like why are we adding

153
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,100
this to our water supply then the

154
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,800
question of is fluoride really essential

155
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,300
for tooth Health answer is no most of

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,979
Europe doesn't fluorinate their water

157
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,020
I'll link to the countries which do

158
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,940
fluoride fluoridate that water now fair

159
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,100
enough Europeans get their fluoride from

160
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,240
toothpaste so am I against toothpaste

161
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,680
fluoridation or not that's a different

162
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,960
question which I'll get to the fact of

163
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,940
the matter is water fluoridation isn't

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
actually that effective or important

165
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,660
when it comes to tooth health so we have

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,240
this effect on the pineal gland that we

167
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,880
know of we also know that the effect on

168
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,340
tooth decay is minimal if anything so

169
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,080
the risk to reward ratio is already poor

170
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,380
and then we look at what's actually

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,000
going on again in IQ before we even get

172
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,680
to IQ there's something interesting that

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,780
I want to point out the rate of

174
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,539
calcification of the pineal gland is

175
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,580
actually twice in males what it is in

176
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,380
females and we don't know why like even

177
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,240
the best scientists in this field don't

178
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,919
really know why we barely understand

179
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,360
these things and when we don't

180
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,400
understand something the last thing we

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,319
should do is tamper with it now going

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,300
more deeply into the IQ issue what's

183
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,759
going on here again there seems to be an

184
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,560
effect more on males than females which

185
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,180
again scientists don't understand why I

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,039
don't understand why it seemed to be

187
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,780
happening but it's not clear why this is

188
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,639
happening what the information I'm

189
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,280
drawing from is coming from a 2019 paper

190
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,919
which shows that there's almost a five

191
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,720
point decrease among males who've been

192
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,780
exposed to fluoride as an infant in

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,880
their mother's womb and a 3.66 decrease

194
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,680
in females when they're exposed to

195
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,539
fluoride concentrations in the mother's

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
womb why this is happening is still

197
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,440
unexplained and the paper is actually

198
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,900
pretty good they control for other

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,840
pollutants the control for mercury lead

200
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,880
and other known neurotoxins so that they

201
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,220
can isolate the effect of fluoride and

202
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
they still found this lowering of IQ I

203
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,620
already know there's going to be a whole

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
bunch of comments at this point saying

205
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,340
well fluoride is actually present in

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,139
nature well yes it is well that's not

207
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,180
what you're getting in your tap water so

208
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,220
understand this magnesium fluoride yes

209
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,440
it's present in nature calcium chloride

210
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,039
yes it is some small amounts of sodium

211
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,360
chloride yes the fact of the matter is

212
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,520
hydrofluorocilicic acid which is what

213
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,860
they use in the water salination or

214
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,900
sorry water treatment plants is not

215
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,060
something present in nature it is a

216
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,940
industrial byproduct it's an industrial

217
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,360
waste it is a byproduct of either

218
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,220
aluminum production or fertilizer

219
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,139
production so phosphate fertilizer

220
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,639
production so it's a waste product which

221
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,919
is why they government gets it for so

222
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,440
cheap and that's what they use in the

223
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,680
plants they use to create the fluorides

224
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,060
which they put in your water why are

225
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,680
they doing this and why is it so

226
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,479
acceptable that they do this the

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
calcification of the pineal gland issue

228
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,840
especially is very concerning to me you

229
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,699
see the pineal gland again like I said

230
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,160
it's poorly understood but we know for a

231
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,800
fact that it does have a huge effect on

232
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,780
sleep cycles it has a huge effect on

233
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,580
menstrual cycles it's a very very

234
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,379
important gland it has important

235
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,840
functions when it comes to sexual health

236
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,280
so what's going on here we cannot mess

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,020
with this gland which we barely

238
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,180
understand by adding fluorides which

239
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,979
shouldn't be there and then hope that

240
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,620
it's all okay just because it's good for

241
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,320
our teeth the hubris the absolute

242
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,360
Madness and hubris which goes into the

243
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,240
decision-making process of the scientist

244
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,100
slash garment is mind-boggling to me we

245
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,240
have to be extremely careful when it

246
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,000
comes to things relating to the human

247
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,880
body especially the brain think about

248
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,519
this the most complex organ or the most

249
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,380
complex structure on the face of the

250
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,180
Earth and probably in the universe as we

251
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,740
know it is the brain some of you are

252
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,899
already pulling out papers saying

253
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,459
fluoride is safe you misunderstand the

254
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,920
point that I'm making the point I'm

255
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,600
making is philosophical so there is

256
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,279
clearly some mud in the water there are

257
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
some doubts as to whether fluoride is

258
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,820
actually safe for all organ systems in

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,700
the body understand this there's a

260
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,740
principle called informed consent in a

261
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,899
medical Sciences you only provide

262
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,060
medication to people who provide

263
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,279
informed consent the only two exceptions

264
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,779
are one for children who aren't able to

265
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,339
provide informed consent so that

266
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,019
guardian or parent provides you from

267
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,240
consent and then of course we have the

268
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,920
extreme elderly who again for the same

269
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,800
reasons you have Guardians providing

270
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,500
information informed consent means you

271
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,140
understand the risks and the rewards of

272
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,720
a treatment program and knowing those

273
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,519
risks and rewards you say yes when it

274
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,339
comes to fluoride even the top

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,040
scientists don't understand fully what

276
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,019
it does to the body so none of us are

277
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,880
really in a position to give informed

278
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,160
consent but the government deems it okay

279
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
to add this medication to the water

280
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,240
regardless of this principle so it's a

281
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,180
violation of a medical principle and

282
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,279
then we have the Hippocratic oh doctors

283
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,760
take the Hippocratic Oath it's an oath

284
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:13,680
which says Do no harm first Do no harm

285
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,019
it means when you do a medical

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,899
intervention your first priority to make

287
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,459
sure that you're not causing harm in the

288
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,959
due course of your medical intervention

289
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,940
so what's going on with the fluoridation

290
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,040
systems yeah you could say that it does

291
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,300
help our teeth which I have some doubts

292
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,580
about that but let's say it does help

293
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,860
our teeth it does harm other organ

294
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,760
systems you violate the Hippocratic Oath

295
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,980
you are potentially doing harm so both

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,800
philosophical principles are violated

297
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,839
then we have of course the idea that the

298
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,579
brain is a complex system probably it's

299
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,440
the most complex system that we know of

300
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,920
and then when you take into account that

301
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,260
Society what is society Society is a

302
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,300
network effect of millions and billions

303
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,160
of brains right brains are all really

304
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,140
impeccably designed designed and

305
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,220
amazingly complex you take those and you

306
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,440
have a network effect and that's what

307
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,959
Society is we barely understand these

308
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,360
things it's extreme hubris which says

309
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,220
you can add things to protect our teeth

310
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,019
which could have other effects on

311
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,300
society and our brains so for those

312
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,339
philosophical Reasons I'm very very

313
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,560
negative towards the idea of mass

314
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,600
medication and this is the Crux of the

315
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,820
esoteric Health movement where finding

316
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,860
out that the cutting and science backs

317
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,600
up ancient Traditions is finding out

318
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,339
that there are secrets hidden from us

319
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,260
the common people simply don't know

320
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,420
various facts about what they consume

321
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm planning to make one mini course per

322
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,380
month for this exclusive community and

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the first I'm thinking of is of course

324
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,980
testosterone boosting and esoteric

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,779
Health but later on I would like to do a

326
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,100
course on being a synthesizer which is

327
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,959
what I'm doing right now I'm

328
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,459
synthesizing Knowledge from a variety of

329
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,500
sources and bringing it together in an

330
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,839
easily understood and narrative fashion

331
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,940
with storytelling so that you retain the

332
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,380
information which you're learning we

333
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,360
talked about some of the bad stuff but

334
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,180
there is good news too there was a study

335
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,500
done on mice brains well mice are not a

336
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,060
perfect proxy for the human brain

337
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,399
obviously but they are pretty good

338
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,839
because they're mammals so they took

339
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,459
mice brains and they studied what

340
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,100
happens if they remove fluoride

341
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,420
completely from their diet and water and

342
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,940
what they found is actually the pineal

343
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,860
gland cells start to grow once you

344
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,420
remove fluoride so that's a very good

345
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,220
sign for us it means that if we cut out

346
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,660
the fluorides from our diet and water it

347
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,700
actually might help us grow our own

348
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,140
pineal glands back and might reverse

349
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,940
some of the damage which was done so the

350
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,440
question becomes well how do you do this

351
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,120
how do you cut out the fluoride from the

352
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
water I will give you all the

353
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
information you need to know regarding

354
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,459
mitigation at the end of this video we

355
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,019
talked about science and philosophy now

356
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,160
it comes to intuition what does my

357
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,320
intuition say well the one thing

358
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,120
everything just feels off about the

359
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,940
whole fluoride thing the fact that the

360
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,620
government cares so much about well our

361
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,660
tooth decay and doesn't really care

362
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,000
about diabetes cancer and obesity is

363
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,220
very concerning to me and it just is a

364
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,899
red flag to me this is intuition this is

365
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,660
not science I'm not proving something

366
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,820
with evidence this is my gut feeling

367
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,560
that that what's going on here isn't

368
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,600
correct so I'm trying to separate out

369
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,980
the science and my own feelings I don't

370
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,959
want to necessarily bias the science

371
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,820
right so another thing is the

372
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,019
evolutionary angle behind this humans

373
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,060
have been around for millions of years

374
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,560
why is it suddenly that we need fluoride

375
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,060
to keep our teeth safe if you look at

376
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,339
the fossil record this is interesting

377
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,940
you actually see the best quality teeth

378
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,139
the strongest teeth strongest skulls in

379
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,720
pre-agricultural human beings so before

380
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,279
agriculture was invented that was when

381
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,200
humans were the most healthy so

382
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,760
agriculture does not actually help the

383
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,260
human condition it was actually when

384
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,480
people were hunting for their food that

385
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,100
people were more healthy looking at bone

386
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,200
structure looking at teeth health but

387
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,519
even then really think about this so the

388
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
incavement times you know like

389
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,959
prehistoric and even the Bronze Age

390
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,420
times even after agriculture if people

391
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,160
didn't have teeth by the age of 10 if

392
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,260
people's teeth were rotting off by the

393
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,880
age of 10 or 15 then a humans wouldn't

394
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,800
have made it this far right humans

395
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,540
wouldn't have made it this far if teeth

396
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,579
literally just brought it and fell out

397
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,680
from ages 10 to 15 which was what was

398
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,060
happening in the mid 90s and and of

399
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,680
course instead of looking at the root

400
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,540
cause which was probably high fructose

401
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,000
corn syrup and carbohydrate intake

402
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,639
increase they found an artificial

403
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,680
solution for an artificial problem they

404
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,720
found an industrial solution for an

405
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,820
industrial problem this is backwards

406
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,620
what they should have done is gone right

407
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,540
to the source and then cut the source

408
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,940
they didn't do this and this is a

409
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,380
failure on a Monumental level we talked

410
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,180
about science we're talking about

411
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,339
philosophy and intuition now we come to

412
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,620
the observations what did I observe when

413
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,200
I cut out fluorides from my water supply

414
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,820
so here's something interesting I didn't

415
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,639
connect the dots when it first happened

416
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,040
because it's a very very very slow

417
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,839
process when you come off the fluoride

418
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,279
right I cut out the fluid from the water

419
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,380
and I was looking for non-fluoridated

420
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,699
toothpaste and I bought one I used it I

421
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,680
was looking for a different one I looked

422
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,300
at the reviews on Amazon for one of the

423
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,279
non-fluoridated toothpaste and what I

424
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,860
learned was a lot of people in the

425
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,019
reviews were saying that they were able

426
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,540
to dream better and I remember thinking

427
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,240
yeah I felt the same thing I saw the

428
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,399
same benefit I found that I was dreaming

429
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,380
more nights like I was able to retain my

430
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,779
dreams it remember my dreams for more

431
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,579
nights and I realized that all these

432
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,199
people who were all doing the um

433
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,420
non-fluidated toothpaste they probably

434
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,800
were like me being skeptical of the

435
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,040
fluoridation of our water and probably

436
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,260
used fluoride filters as well so a large

437
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,260
collection of people all of them had the

438
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,360
same result which was a result in deeper

439
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,820
and better sleep which makes sense

440
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,040
because I talked about the pineal gland

441
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,500
before and the pineal gland has a huge

442
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,240
effect on our sleep cycles so perhaps

443
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,980
now of course this is just a hypothesis

444
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,480
right this is not a scientific study and

445
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,339
I don't claim to make a scientific

446
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,380
theory on this topic I'm just saying

447
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,000
that a large number of people when they

448
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,440
came off fluoride are dreaming better

449
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,300
and that's all I need to know that's

450
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,120
enough for me that's enough observation

451
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,500
for me to recommend this to you over the

452
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,600
past eight months or maybe even nine

453
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,760
months I've been practicing an esoteric

454
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,920
oral hygiene routine if you want that

455
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,199
video put it in the comments below did

456
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,680
you know that Listerine was literally a

457
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,079
psychological operation Listerine is not

458
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,420
a mouthwash it's a floor cleaner the

459
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,519
company which made Listerine rebranded

460
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,160
and resold a floor cleaner as a

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,160
mouthwash with very clever Marketing in

462
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,160
fact I think the word halitosis which is

463
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,380
bad breath with literally coined by them

464
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
to make bad breath sound like a scary

465
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,160
disease rather than just what it is it's

466
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,440
a common problem and instead of

467
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,959
addressing again root causes of probably

468
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,899
carb intake and high fructose corn syrup

469
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,000
they decided to sell a literal floor

470
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,800
cleaner as a mouthwash and guess get

471
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,500
this Listerine actually doesn't help

472
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,600
halitosis Listerine has alcohol in it

473
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,060
which dries out your mouth which causes

474
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,860
imbalances of microbes in your mouth

475
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,420
there's the gut microbiome which I'm

476
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,459
sure you've heard of is also the mouth

477
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,600
microbiome and I don't even want to go

478
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,579
into what fluoride does to the mouth

479
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,139
microbiome but the fact of the matter is

480
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,820
Listerine actually destroys your

481
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,500
microbiome and reduces saliva output and

482
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,720
that causes

483
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,899
bad breath in the mouth so I will give

484
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,399
you my entire oral hygiene routine if

485
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,540
you ask for it in the comments but don't

486
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,640
worry about it I'll give you your

487
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,959
esoteric skin care before I do that but

488
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,240
jumping back into Philosophy for a

489
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,040
second who does the burden of proof lie

490
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,419
on this is a very important Concept in

491
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,819
Philosophy for example in Criminal

492
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,559
Courts the burden of proof lies on the

493
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,540
accuser the accuser has to prove that

494
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,860
the guilty is guilty only then is a

495
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,600
punishment made it out that's not the

496
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,459
case when it comes to our health and

497
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,260
additions to our health like artificial

498
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,020
additions to our health the burden of

499
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,059
proof lies in the claim that they should

500
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,740
add X Y and Z to our diet to make us

501
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,380
healthier because more often than not

502
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,840
additions harm us so we should be extra

503
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,120
skeptical the burden of proof should lie

504
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,059
on those who want to change the status

505
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,360
quo it is not up to us to prove that

506
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,520
fluoride is unsafe it is up to them to

507
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,100
prove that fluoride is safe not only

508
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,500
safe but safe for every single person

509
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,900
and every single organ system in every

510
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,400
single body it's only then that we can

511
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,140
allow this to be be added to public

512
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
water supply because they literally

513
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,400
force you to drink this understand this

514
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,780
it's going to take you about 200 to get

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
the fluid out of your water I haven't

516
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,480
even gone into the mitigation section

517
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,460
yet but I'm telling you right now it's

518
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,200
going to cost 150 to 200 for you to get

519
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,760
your water purified so the government is

520
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,100
adding this stuff to our water and then

521
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,320
charging essentially 200 to get it out

522
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,419
this is simply unfair it's an example of

523
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,460
government overreach finally here we are

524
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,679
at the mitigation sections reactionable

525
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,299
steps what do you actually do like what

526
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,860
do you physically do and what purchases

527
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,539
can you make right I'll tell you first

528
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,460
thing charcoal filters so charcoal

529
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,320
filters are those Brita charcoal filters

530
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,880
you attach on your Taps Unfortunately

531
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,380
they don't do a great job of removing

532
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,360
fluoride from your water they do an

533
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,039
excellent job of removing estrogenic

534
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,679
substances from your water so if all you

535
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,299
can afford is the chi 40 charcoal filter

536
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,559
you should still get one it's still

537
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,020
worth your time still worth your money

538
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,340
that's literal birth control estrogenics

539
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,620
in your water do you know that the water

540
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,419
filtration plants don't remove birth

541
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,400
control from the water so women who take

542
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,080
birth control they pee those molecules

543
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,299
out of their body that goes into a water

544
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,860
supply Ai and the water treatment plant

545
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,660
does not filter these substances out

546
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,940
when you drink them so you're literally

547
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,559
drinking birth control estrogenics which

548
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,000
come out of a woman's pee the effects

549
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,740
that it has on the male body and also

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,539
the female body is something you will

551
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,400
see in a different video if you want

552
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,020
that video let me know and then we come

553
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,000
back to the mitigation section right so

554
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,500
you should buy a charcoal water filter

555
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
if that's all you can afford that's fine

556
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,320
do it because there's a difference

557
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,700
between the estrogenics and the fluoride

558
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,559
so the estrogenics had an immediate

559
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,020
effect on your body the fluoride

560
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,820
actually is a buildup process it takes

561
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,860
some time to accumulate and then become

562
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,240
toxic so you have some time if you're

563
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,520
too broke right now to afford a better

564
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,020
filter get the charcoal filter and then

565
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,580
stop being broke like you got to make

566
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,559
money this is not a money making Channel

567
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,940
find the right guys the right channels

568
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,440
which teach you how to make money and

569
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,679
start making money that you can afford

570
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,480
an RO system a reverse osmosis system is

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,400
what I recommend a Reverse Osmosis

572
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,260
System removes up to 95 percent of the

573
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,820
fluoride in your water so if you can

574
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,039
spend 200 bucks and get an RO filter

575
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,360
that's exactly what you should do and of

576
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,220
course not just the fluoride right the

577
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,080
RO filter is going to remove the and

578
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,059
other substances as well so you should

579
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,240
absolutely absolutely invest in that

580
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,440
spending 200 on an RO filter is far more

581
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
beneficial than spending it on like

582
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,620
supplements or something like that and

583
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,780
the other alternative is a water

584
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,580
distiller this is the ultimate option

585
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
now the RO filter is very convenient

586
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,640
because you just turn on a tap and you

587
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,740
get clean water a distiller is more hard

588
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,120
to use but it is very efficient the

589
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,919
difference between the RO filter and

590
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,900
distiller is distiller literally removes

591
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
everything from the water so maybe you

592
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,740
lose out on some minerals and

593
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,200
electrolytes by doing that but a

594
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,360
distiller it's also about 150 to 200 US

595
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,460
dollars it will evaporate the water and

596
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,980
then condense it so that you have pure

597
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,539
H2O pure water as pure as you can get it

598
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,160
anyway but the thing is if you use a

599
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,020
distiller you need to add electrolytes

600
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,059
back into the water for you to actually

601
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,200
use it don't drink distilled water like

602
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,179
it'll actually harm you you need

603
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,919
distilled water plus electrolytes for it

604
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,720
to be absorbed better by the body

605
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,400
understand that you are at The Cutting

606
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,320
Edge you are at the Forefront of the

607
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,660
esoteric Health movement you need to

608
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,919
watch my video on seed oils which is a

609
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,980
whole different topic to check that

610
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,980
