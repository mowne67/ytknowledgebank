1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,000
well if you buy your milk in the grocery

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,599
store and you get one of these

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,280
things these boys these bad boys then

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,039
yes absolutely your milk is estrogenic

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,640
so get this there's actually three

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,760
different kinds of estrogens in this one

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,119
carton of

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,039
milk so first the cows which make this

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,759
milk are fed with soy and grain cuz it

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,880
doesn't say grass-fed so that means it's

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,200
being fed with soy which of course you

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,600
know has

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,600
phytoestrogens which have estrogenic

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,280
effects then it's also fed with grain

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,200
and usually the lowest quality moldy ass

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,320
grain and this contains fungus and

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,440
fungus produces a toxin called zaa which

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:55,000
is an estrogenic so phytoestrogens plus

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,600
zaa already two then it's in this kind

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,480
of compressible plastic which means that

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,960
it contains BPA and if it's B B free

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,920
which doesn't even say BPA free so it

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,600
probably just has straight up BPA and if

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,000
it said BPA free I would think that it

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,360
has BPS or BPF so three different kinds

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,400
of estrogens just in this carton of milk

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,040
so what's the truth then what should

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,159
what should you do well the truth is

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
both more

30
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,560
terrible and more hopeful because if you

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,079
just go down the aisle and you pick up

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,200
one of

33
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,960
these this is

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,880
some high quality milk in a glass bottle

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,320
so this is the one which I would choose

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,079
and I do choose

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,920
cuz it's in a glass bottle so it doesn't

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,520
have the uh BPA and I know it's

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,200
grass-fed grass finished high quality

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,880
milk so I'm happy to drink it every day

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,320
and the thing is I um actually have an

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,640
eggnog recipe which calls for milk I

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,880
have the esoteric eggnog Elixir and you

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,520
should absolutely check it out because

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,880
it's combination of egg and milk and

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,920
cream high in fat perfect for boosting

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,759
testosterone and counteracting some of

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,599
the effect of this estrogenic stuff in

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,040
our diet another thing I should say is

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,480
um if you drink skim milk what are you

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,239
doing bro like you shouldn't be drinking

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,720
skim milk skim milk is a scam 2% milk is

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,920
a scam 1% milk is a scam they literally

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,080
take out the best most nutritious part

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,000
of the milk and substitute it with

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,040
fillers and they sell it for the same

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,160
price it's like why do you drink that if

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
you're going to buy milk buy whole milk

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,680
buy it in a glass bottle if possible

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
grass-fed grass finished and you should

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:54,810
be good

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:54,810
