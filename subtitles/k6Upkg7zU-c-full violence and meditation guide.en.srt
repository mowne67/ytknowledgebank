contact you just explode the M2 heavy

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,660
machine gun can send rounds at a rate of

600 rounds per minute at a maximum

effective range of 2000 meters and I

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,560
have the duty and privilege of using

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,920
this weapon and I also teach yoga

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,840
a harmless man is not a good man a good

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
man is he who is capable of Untold

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
violence but has the ability to keep

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,020
that in check a quote from Dr Peterson

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,420
of course Dr Peterson explains this by

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,040
quoting the biblical verse the meek

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,020
shall inherit the earth he describes

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,539
that the word meek in Modern English

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,520
means weak it means timid but it

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,800
describes how in Old English the word

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,500
meek meant something like a man who knew

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,180
how to use a sword but chose to keep its

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,980
sheathed unless he needed it it is my

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,899
belief that to have the ability to go to

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,000
war but choose to do so only when needed

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,619
is a mark of virtue but more importantly

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,479
I need to make lunch all these

28
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,520
vegetables are already washed and clean

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,140
and ready to go I'm making chicken broth

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,520
using a crock pot now a lot of you

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,740
probably think you know crock pot is

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
like what your grandmom uses no no if

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,880
you are going to the gym and you want to

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,380
do meal prep crock pot is the way to go

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,119
man I just put all these healthy

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,100
ingredients in here and in about four to

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,020
eight hours I'll describe how it's ready

38
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,979
and it smells amazing tastes amazing is

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,780
extremely good for your body

40
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,580
testosterone boosting ingredients I'll

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,960
teach you how to make this and also

42
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,140
speak about philosophy a little bit so

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,360
obviously you should train your ability

44
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,740
to perform violence go ahead do your

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,900
martial arts class you know go to

46
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,240
kickboxing go to BJJ do what you want to

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,259
do but you should also be honing the

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,659
other side of virtue which is having the

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,040
ability to have presence when you are in

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,960
communication with people having the

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,020
ability to empathize with people

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,240
understand others not only for your own

53
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,759
well-being but also in a business sense

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,799
to have the ability to empathize with

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,479
people and understand them is a first

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,520
step in creating a product that people

57
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,880
actually want to buy and coming back to

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,099
the carrots so carrots contain

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,959
beta-carotenes these are pigments this

60
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,900
is literally what makes a carrot orange

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,060
so these literally will become a part of

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,340
your blood and that's what will make

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,680
your skin look lustrous and healthy so

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,300
if you are on the looks maxing journey

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,800
and you want to look better carrots are

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,300
the way to go it'll make your skin look

67
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,280
healthy it'll give some pigmentation

68
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,480
some luster and then we have potatoes so

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,620
everybody should sell potatoes you know

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,180
it's like potatoes are bad for you it's

71
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,819
like no they're not potatoes contain a

72
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,220
lot of vitamin C vitamin A and the Skins

73
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,780
contain antioxidants so if you have the

74
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,340
ability don't get the yellow ones like

75
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,480
don't get the brown ones get the colored

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,739
potatoes like the red ones which I'm

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,300
having right here these are a little bit

78
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,599
better regardless potatoes aren't the

79
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,599
enemy

80
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,959
empathy presence and understanding are

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
also skills that you need to maintain

82
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,400
along with you know your Martial Arts

83
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,200
and Firearm skills Etc and these are

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,060
skills that you can generally get better

85
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,560
at and you should start probably with

86
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,060
meditation I know everybody talks about

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,620
meditation but no one gives you actually

88
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,000
what to do sit on your ass for 30

89
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,400
minutes but nothing happens I've been

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,140
there guys so before that garlic so

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,060
garlic I'm not even going to go into the

92
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,159
details of garlic garlic contains a lot

93
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,959
a lot of compounds complex compounds

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,140
which have been shown to have blood

95
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,000
purifying effects so what I do is just

96
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,340
get the skin off these cloves garlic

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,340
cloves I will take my blade and just

98
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
or you know just break them and toss

99
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,860
them in there I'm not going to spend the

100
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,060
time to cut them up doesn't matter

101
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,860
so I'm going to tell you exactly how

102
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,480
meditation works and while I'm doing so

103
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm going to cut myself a tournament so

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,040
turnips are cruciferous vegetables the

105
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,040
same as cauliflower or broccoli and

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,700
these contain something called indols

107
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,920
i-n-d-o-l-e-s if you wanted to look it

108
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,560
up and indoors do not increase your

109
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,780
testosterone but they have an effect of

110
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,640
mitigating against phytoestrogens in

111
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,379
your bloodstream so even if they don't

112
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,540
increase your testosterone they actually

113
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,120
help increase the effect your current

114
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,799
testosterone level has on your body now

115
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,480
coming back to meditation let me Define

116
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,340
it for you to understand anything we

117
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,920
need to Define it first meditation is

118
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,659
the focus on an external stimulus at the

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
cost of the voice in your head let me

120
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,860
explain by the way mushrooms amazing

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,000
source of zinc magnesium selenium all

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,560
the things which your body needs to

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,139
synthesize testosterone I should remark

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,459
that when I say X increases testosterone

125
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,139
that doesn't mean that women shouldn't

126
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,639
eat them the fact of the matter is the

127
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,259
endocrine system in men is just better

128
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,000
studied and better understood than that

129
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,500
in women so I'm more comfortable just

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,120
saying you know this increases

131
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,460
testosterone but these same

132
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,620
micronutrient are obviously extremely

133
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,060
helpful for female hormonal production

134
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,500
as well so if you happen to be a lady

135
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,199
listening to this please eat your

136
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,460
mushrooms so meditation let me break

137
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,560
down my definition for you the first

138
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,240
part I said is to focus on an external

139
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,979
stimulus an external stimulus could be

140
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,780
anything oftentimes in traditional

141
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,160
meditation the external stimulus is the

142
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,840
sensation of your breath so you're

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,699
breathing but doesn't have to be it

144
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,639
could be literally anything for example

145
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,979
prayer beads so this is a what's called

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,660
rudraksha and you can get 10 prayer bees

147
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,720
on Amazon if you wanted to so all you do

148
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,720
all I do is focus on the sensation of my

149
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,240
thumb on each bead as I move it along

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,860
and as you know the fingertips are the

151
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,199
most sensitive parts of your body so

152
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,120
that sensation is very finely felt and

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,440
if you focus on that that could be your

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,940
meditation you don't necessarily have to

155
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,040
focus on the breath and for me I find

156
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,419
the beads meditation just easier to do

157
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,220
than breath meditation so this is

158
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,960
something you can try so focus on the

159
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,460
external stimulus that's the first part

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
you're focusing on the external stimulus

161
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,120
at the expense of the voice in your head

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,620
so your voice the narration which

163
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,000
happens in your head is ongoing the

164
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,199
voice in your head which is speaking

165
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
about the things that you're going

166
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,340
around you about thoughts for the future

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,660
regrets of the past the voice in your

168
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,160
head tells you the things that you want

169
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,020
to hear but it also tells you the things

170
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,900
that you don't want to when you focus on

171
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,699
external stimulus you force out the

172
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,440
mind's voice obviously this is not

173
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,660
something you want permanently you do

174
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,699
want your voice of the mind to help you

175
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,280
think however without meditation we

176
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,900
become over reliant on that voice and we

177
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,520
don't even know what it feels like to

178
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,699
have silence in our lives for this

179
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,320
reason meditation is indispensable

180
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,139
and say you don't have the time to do

181
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,699
meditation that's fine you can do a deep

182
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,320
breathing exercise instead which might

183
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,020
be easier for some people so literally

184
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,720
just breathe into your belly

185
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,160
and release it literally one breath has

186
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,960
a calming effect and I feel that

187
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,940
calmness even right now and this is not

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,759
some kind of gimmick to take a voluntary

189
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,919
deep breath has been shown to move your

190
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,960
body from a flight and flight response

191
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,580
to a rest and relaxed response so you

192
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,259
can use your breath the conscious

193
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,819
understanding the conscious perception

194
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,560
of your breath to mitigate the mode in

195
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,300
which your body is functioning all right

196
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,500
so what spices do you need to season

197
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,819
this thing I have a whole bunch of

198
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,380
spices here which me which I'm gonna add

199
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,060
but you don't need all of these I'll

200
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,639
tell you exactly what's optional first

201
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,919
I'm adding turmeric turmeric and Indian

202
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,259
spice known for many many different

203
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,539
medicinal properties it has like a mild

204
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,699
mellow taste next I have oregano which

205
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,520
is a white person spice so just little

206
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,500
bit does it then we have ginger and

207
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,300
garlic powder so ideally I would have

208
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,919
ginger garlic paste which you literally

209
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,660
just take Ginger and take garlic and

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,100
mash it up in your blender or your mixer

211
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,539
but I don't happen to have it right now

212
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,639
so I'm just going to use powdered

213
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,560
versions so what's optional here and

214
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,720
what's not the turmeric is optional the

215
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,639
oregano is optional ginger garlic paste

216
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,620
or gin ginger garlic powder I would say

217
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,180
you would definitely want to have it but

218
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,740
even that's kind of optional then we

219
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,620
have time so I also have some fresh

220
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,259
thyme which is also optional next we

221
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,000
have bay leaves which are also optional

222
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,380
but I'm going to add these after I've

223
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,580
already mixed it up because otherwise

224
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,199
this will break and there'll be

225
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,880
fragments of leaf in your food which you

226
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,039
don't want also optional then I have

227
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,120
some cloves I guess like three of them

228
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,560
optional what's not optional is salt and

229
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,419
all the mainstream media is going to

230
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,039
tell you salt is bad sodium is going to

231
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,560
give you heart disease no it's not salt

232
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,539
is essential part of a healthy lifestyle

233
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,699
and pepper pepper is also not optional

234
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,560
and you actually need more salt than

235
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,120
they tell you in general the mainstream

236
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,580
advice when it comes to nutrition is

237
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,259
kind of [ __ ] so you have to do your own

238
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,819
research and have your own understanding

239
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,319
about nutrition all right you're almost

240
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,120
done all we need is the chicken which

241
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,979
I've already washed so I noticed

242
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,979
something interesting meditation helps

243
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,139
me in kickboxing so when I am sparring

244
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,300
with a partner my best performance has

245
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,060
always been if I meditated before coming

246
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,919
to kickboxing I find that I'm present in

247
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,419
the moment with my sparring partner I'm

248
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,919
just able to judge his moves better I'm

249
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,599
not even thinking any thoughts in my

250
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,280
head I just move depending on the

251
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,020
situation I'm able to get my guard up

252
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,300
faster I'm able to throw punches faster

253
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,740
it's just so much more effortless when

254
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,479
you have an awareness and presence

255
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,039
instead of your thinking thoughts if

256
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,020
you're thinking I'm going to throw a

257
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,640
punch you already have that delay if you

258
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,140
think I'm going to have to block it you

259
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,180
have the delay but if you're meditating

260
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,500
and you're present in the movement while

261
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,260
you're fighting it's a different game

262
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,720
and then I spoke about yoga so what is

263
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,000
yoga and what is meditation in my

264
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,580
personal opinion yoga is the same as

265
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,760
meditation except that it's Dynamic so

266
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,320
yoga is dynamic meditation so instead of

267
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,940
focusing on the breath and sitting down

268
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,040
in a stationary position like you do in

269
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,320
meditation in yoga you're moving you're

270
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,180
using your body in real space while

271
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,160
having the same level of awareness as

272
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,959
you do in meditation so yoga in some

273
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,240
ways is even Superior to sitting down

274
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,740
type meditation which is why I have the

275
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,380
pleasure of being able to teach it at my

276
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,940
University remember the body is the the

277
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,560
interface between the mind and the

278
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,360
physical world your quality of life

279
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,700
literally depends on the quality of your

280
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,680
body don't neglect health no matter what

281
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,480
don't neglect hormonal health no matter

282
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,680
what make sure your mental health is tip

283
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,899
top shape and then you have a much

284
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,120
higher chance of business success so I'm

285
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,100
going to go ahead and add my chicken to

286
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,740
the crock pot and as I do so I want to

287
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,320
thank you for the immense growth of this

288
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,000
channel it's been crazy I had 25

289
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,920
subscribers at the starting of this week

290
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,959
and now I have more than five thousand

291
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,120
it's insane what you have done and the

292
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,560
credit of course goes to you and my

293
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,220
editor Jan for making this thing

294
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,140
possible I am loving the notion of being

295
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,700
able to create these stories and teach

296
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,380
you about food and nutrition and cooking

297
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,360
and being potentially paid to do so

298
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,740
that's just an amazing experience and

299
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,019
you've made this possible for me you

300
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,640
have my greatest gratitude and my

301
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,500
greatest thanks so what do we do from

302
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,360
here I've added my chicken wash my hands

303
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,580
because I need to add the olive oil

304
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,080
always get the extra virgin olive oil

305
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,700
try to pay a little bit more and get the

306
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,519
good stuff because most olive oil in the

307
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,839
markets is a blend of potentially rancid

308
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,540
olive oil which is not really good for

309
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,720
you also don't use seed oil no sunflower

310
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,519
oil no canola oil grapeseed oil none of

311
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,279
these at all in your diet extra virgin

312
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,260
olive oil is definitely a option you can

313
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,580
also use butter which I'm going to add a

314
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,500
little bit of butter to my cooking and

315
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,180
also if you noticed I did not remove the

316
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,740
skins from these chicken thighs and

317
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,300
there's a reason for this the skin of

318
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,760
these chicken thighs actually contains

319
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,860
the fats that we want it's the fats in

320
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,779
these meats that gives us the ability

321
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,000
our body the ability to create the

322
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,040
testosterone so I want to have the skins

323
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,720
on my meat now I'll try to write up a

324
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
how-to in a recipe and put in the

325
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,620
description for you guys to see but what

326
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,779
I do now is I need to kind of blend all

327
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,519
this up all the spices and the oil and

328
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,980
the food looks but you know I'm going to

329
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,720
eat it really going to

330
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,839
add myself

331
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,420
some vegetables from this

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,620
other video which I was making some

333
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,779
broccoli

334
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,500
and some cauliflower

335
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:16,200
so I sauteed these in butter and this

336
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,420
whole video I made doing this

337
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,940
so you can watch that and learn how I

338
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,740
made this so this is extremely extremely

339
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,019
good for you especially from a

340
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,240
testosterone building standpoint not

341
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,220
because broccoli and cauliflower can

342
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,740
help you make testosterone but because

343
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,839
they have indoors which are compounds

344
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,440
which reduce the effect of

345
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,839
estrogen in your bloodstream so this

346
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,459
whole meal right here with the protein

347
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,720
the fats the cats the potatoes mushrooms

348
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:49,200
broccoli and cauliflower

349
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,380
is a complete meal perfectly designed

350
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,540
for hormonal health and you know this is

351
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,720
going to be tasting amazing every

352
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,760
ingredient has been chosen by me for a

353
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,339
purpose

354
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
and

355
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,500
you know

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,459
I hope you get a chance to try something

357
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,459
like this thank you very much

358
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,220
