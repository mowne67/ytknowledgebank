1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
every civilized man regardless of where

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,480
he's from or where he lives thinks about

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,099
the Roman Empire every single day and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,980
after this video you'll know exactly why

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,540
in July of this year I marched upon the

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,980
city of Rome well actually I took the

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,920
train from Naples but you get the point

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,080
so most people plan their Europe trip to

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,660
go and have good food drink good wine

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,480
meet fine women Etc not that I didn't do

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,519
any of these but my true objective was

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,820
to trace the path of the great General

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,099
Hannibal Barca as he voyaged into Italy

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,800
two words Rome so I better understand

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,380
what it is about the Eternal City that

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,420
captures the male psyche so well I went

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,520
from the coasts of Liberia across the

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
French Riviera through the Alps into

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,379
Italy proper to Naples and then to Rome

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
in order to bring you this story most

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,320
people don't know this but Rome wasn't

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,020
always a superpower there was an other

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,940
superpower across Mediterranean in

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,000
Africa this superpower was called

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,399
Carthage Carthage was the enemy of Rome

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,199
and their General Hannibal burka was the

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,420
arch nemesis is of the Roman Republic

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,760
the thing is the Romans knew he was

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,920
coming and the Roman knew how good an

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,020
army and a general that he was so they

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,460
were very they were warned they thought

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,560
that perhaps he would attack from the

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,060
West attacking at masalia from the

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,439
Iberian Peninsula perhaps he would

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
attack from the East maybe he would be

36
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,400
making allies with the macedonians in

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,020
Greece perhaps your attack from the

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,080
south may be attacked directly from

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,720
Africa which is his home base but no our

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,759
mad lad takes Italy from the north

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,340
across the Alps our feet were just

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,640
considered impossible marching his army

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,220
with elephants across the Alps during

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,860
the winter and then he of course lost

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,479
men during the grueling journey across

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,939
the Alps but when he came into Italy he

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,579
was taking Rome completely by storm

48
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,140
completely by surprise now Hannibal knew

49
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,759
exactly what he was doing he was a

50
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,040
fantastic General one the best on the

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,619
planet across history across time so he

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,659
knew why he did what he did he had to

53
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,420
take Rome by surprise Rome at this point

54
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,820
was a powerful powerful force with the

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,439
Navy and an Army strong as his if not

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,119
stronger in terms of Manpower but

57
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,640
Hannibal was not to be dissuaded he

58
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,520
would take Rome no matter what he had a

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,620
job to be done and in his own words he

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
would rather find a way or he would make

61
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,300
one and as I followed his path from

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,099
Portugal and Spain all the way to France

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,080
and through the Alps into Italy I

64
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,360
actually met up with Channel subscribers

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,520
and they took me to the coolest little

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,080
places which only locals would know the

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
best part about having an audience on

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,379
social media is every city I go to I

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
know people there or at least people

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,319
know me there and they're willing to

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,239
take their time out to show me cool

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
places but regardless even after Rome

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,480
was invaded from the north completely by

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
surprise by Hannibal Barker the Roman

75
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,379
Empire was quick to recover and quick to

76
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,720
react Rome marshalled its armies

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,940
thousands of men strong tens of

78
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,860
thousands of men strong and they sent

79
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,360
them against the great General Hannibal

80
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,920
Barker but you think that Hannibal

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,040
Parker didn't really have reinforcements

82
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,660
he was in enemy territory all he had was

83
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,160
what he came with across the Alps he

84
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,739
couldn't really refit he didn't have

85
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,019
more equipment he did have more food he

86
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,360
was on the back foot kind of but then

87
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,640
again he was Hannibal Barca No Ordinary

88
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
man like I said before so when the Roman

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
armies arrayed against him at Lake

90
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,599
tressamine they were pushed into the

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,879
lake at trebia they were annihilated at

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,739
Kanai they were butchered you understand

93
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,060
that these are not normal defeats in the

94
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,879
same sense that we understand it in

95
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,180
modern battle and Modern Warfare entire

96
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,860
armies were wiped out 80 000 men lost in

97
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,540
an afternoon at the Battle of Kenai when

98
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,760
they got encircled and butchered by the

99
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,040
carthaginians and what does Rome do what

100
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,080
does a sane Nation do when nearly

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,239
one-third of its male population gets

102
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,760
wiped out in a day they would capitulate

103
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,040
any sane Empire anything Kingdom I

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,319
should say or actually Republic would

105
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,120
have in fact capitulated and sued for

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,940
peace try to get the best terms of peace

107
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,680
with Carthage but not Rome Rome would

108
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,540
rather be raised to the ground rather

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,239
than be subjugated or defeated in battle

110
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,680
that was the kind of Roman Republic that

111
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,140
existed in the day of Hannibal

112
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
impossible to be every time you beat it

113
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,319
it only becomes stronger it's resolved

114
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,840
hardens with every defeat how do you

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,640
defeat such a foe and yet that same room

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,040
about six to eight hundred years later

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,680
when the barbarians were at the gates

118
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,299
they couldn't resist even though they

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,639
had more riches than ever even though

120
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,160
they had better technology more soldiers

121
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,019
they had everything on their side they

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,940
were not caught by surprise when The

123
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,560
Barbarians came to take their lands and

124
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,720
take their women and destroy their city

125
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,100
but they couldn't do anything about it

126
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,020
they didn't have the resolve they didn't

127
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,820
have the training they didn't have the

128
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,520
backbone which they had during the time

129
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,400
of carthaginian invasion that same room

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,800
which despised tyranny above all the

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,979
same room that hated Kings and dictators

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,040
would eventually become the home of the

133
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:50,040
worst excesses the worst Emperors Mad

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,320
Men and incompetence tyrants and

135
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Emperors would rule over Rome and take

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,280
it to the ground of course we had some

137
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,940
good Emperors as well but the same room

138
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,220
which would never accept tyranny became

139
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,199
one of the biggest tyrannies on the

140
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,060
planet and across history so understand

141
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,460
this during the time of Hannibal they

142
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,259
hated the idea of a tyrant so much that

143
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,600
they didn't want to put all the power

144
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,400
into one man's hand so even the Roman

145
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,900
army would not be controlled by one man

146
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,639
they would actually change the general

147
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,680
they would have actually two generals

148
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,780
for the Army and they would switch them

149
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,940
out every other day so that one man

150
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,820
doesn't accumulate too much power how

151
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,740
crazy is that they hated tyranny that

152
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,539
much that they would go to absurd

153
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,340
lengths in order to prevent the

154
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,979
centralization of power in one man's

155
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,919
hand and in fact this this Quirk of the

156
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,080
Roman army was taken to its advantage

157
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,880
taken advantage of by Hannibal Barker he

158
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,620
realized that the Romans would change

159
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,720
their General every single day and use

160
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,400
that as a part of his tactics to defeat

161
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,620
them but regardless the points of stands

162
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,020
that they hated tyranny Rome hated

163
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,880
tyranny more than any Nation across

164
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,979
history and yet they fell to corruption

165
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,960
and tyranny this is a Learning lesson to

166
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,880
us all in every civilized part of the

167
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,560
globe this is one of the reasons why men

168
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,720
think of the Roman Empire every single

169
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,400
day they must that is their job and a

170
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,199
lot of external threats the Rome that we

171
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,240
know the Rome that we read about of

172
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,979
course destroyed the external stretch

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,780
one after the other conquering across

174
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,039
the Rhine into Germania let me give you

175
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,600
a list of reasons why men think of the

176
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,120
Roman Empire every single day first of

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,580
all the Aesthetics of course the

178
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,500
architecture art and the color scheme

179
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,319
the color scheme of gold against Crimson

180
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,539
the Aesthetics of the Roman Empire were

181
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,280
top-notch the architecture of the city

182
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,600
of Rome is breathtaking and I should

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,300
know I was there a couple months ago

184
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,280
it's gorgeous and you have to think what

185
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,620
we have now is just the ruins of a dead

186
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,860
Empire the pantheon Temple to the god

187
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,620
Jupiter amazing structure I mean it

188
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,600
still exudes so much power that Dome is

189
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,360
so large it's impossible almost to

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
recreate its towers still stand reaching

191
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Towards the Sky you can actually go

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
there today and touch the very columns

193
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,940
that held this wall up for hundreds of

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,280
years and to this day the Roman Empire

195
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,020
inspires so much art and culture and

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,759
music and believe so long as

197
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,259
civilization stands Rome will never die

198
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,880
away from our hearts the second reason

199
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,919
why men think of the Roman Empire every

200
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,259
day was of course because of the values

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,500
they stood for they stood for honor and

202
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,240
courage and virtue and Legacy and family

203
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,220
and these are the virtues which are

204
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
dying in this day of course we think

205
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,460
about these things about the things that

206
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,860
we lost the things that the Roman Empire

207
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,539
stood for but that being said the Romans

208
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,060
were not just a bunch of disciplinarians

209
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,740
always doing their Duty Etc no they knew

210
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,000
how to have a good time read about what

211
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,039
they did during the Festival of

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,620
saturnalia and most of all we remember

213
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,780
Rome because of the greatness that they

214
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,819
achieved and of course the great fall

215
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,860
that they had they achieved all the

216
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,919
glory that was known to man but they

217
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,900
also therefore felt the hardest and is

218
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,580
up to us to learn what they did right so

219
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,440
that we can emulate that and we can also

220
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,360
learn from what they did wrong that we

221
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,160
may be warned indeed let's get into that

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,479
last Point what can we learn from the

223
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,460
decline in fall of the Roman Empire

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,440
first of all I want to talk about the

225
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,780
praetorian Guard the praetorian guard

226
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,300
were hand-picked Elite soldiers from the

227
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,419
legion whose only job was to defend the

228
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,880
emperor against all ill they were just

229
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,380
Noble and fiercely loyal to the emperor

230
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
and what they did their job was to be

231
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,440
kind of a secret service they were

232
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,180
intelligent and brave men who would

233
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,400
protect the Empire against all threats

234
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,319
internal and external and this they did

235
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,479
do for quite a few decades until they

236
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,400
too fell to corruption and what happened

237
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,199
there is the praetorian guard the Secret

238
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Service of the Roman Empire they

239
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,080
realized that their power and money

240
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,240
doesn't depend so much on the job they

241
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,459
do but rather how much control they have

242
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,800
over the emperor so if they had a

243
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,320
genuinely competent and good Emperor he

244
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,640
would Reign their power in and so their

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
incentives were bad you know their

246
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,080
incentives were in fact to install a

247
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,399
puppet their incentives if they wanted

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
the maximum amount of freedom for

249
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,959
themselves and a maximum amount of money

250
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,940
for themselves was to install a puppet

251
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:57,600
Emperor who they could control and of

252
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,459
course kill murder any Emperor who was

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,160
actually showing signs of competence and

254
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,839
they did this it happened a lot the best

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,420
Emperors or at least the best Emperors

256
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,640
who could have Arisen and restored the

257
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,500
Roman Empire were butchered by their own

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,880
bodyguards for their own benefits

259
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,440
because of their own greed and

260
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,140
Corruption and they installed

261
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,120
incompetence who they could control and

262
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,700
now this of course has certain

263
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,560
disturbing parallels with what we see in

264
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,540
the modern world I won't go too much

265
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,860
into this but any man with a thinking

266
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,480
mind can understand what it is I'm

267
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,580
trying to say next let's talk of

268
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,959
demographic change the Roman Empire was

269
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,519
vast and had many many different

270
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,680
cultures in a time where different

271
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,940
cultures actually were different so they

272
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,160
had many cultures they had many

273
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,180
different races and demographies and you

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,040
know different kinds of people living

275
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,680
inside the Roman Empire the Roman Empire

276
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,940
was fairly okay with that simulation but

277
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
that's not the issue the problem

278
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,279
happened when the Roman Empire's armies

279
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,260
were mostly made of non-romans the

280
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,959
armies Rome at one point were made

281
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,580
mostly of Barbarians and then it's no

282
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,260
surprise then is it when the armies

283
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,180
marched upon Rome the very armies

284
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,220
weren't to protect the city actually

285
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,200
were the ones who raised it and attacked

286
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,779
it again and again many generals turned

287
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,880
traitor and why not their armies weren't

288
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,940
even Roman every country must realize

289
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,980
that there is a loyalty when the people

290
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,480
of that country are tied to its land and

291
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,580
it's very important you cannot just

292
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,200
import a population and expect the same

293
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,300
amount of loyalty to the initial country

294
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,160
that's just not how human tribalism

295
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,560
works and then finally let's look at the

296
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,940
debasement of currency debasement of

297
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,760
course the word debasement actually

298
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,519
means to change the nature of gold coins

299
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,320
by adding base Metals into them this was

300
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,480
done by many different kingdoms across

301
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,820
time of course but the important one I

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,140
remember is the one done by Diocletian

303
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,459
diet Collision is actually considered to

304
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,380
be one of the restorers of the Roman

305
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,540
Empire but he'd made a huge mistake when

306
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,640
he debased the currency of Rome so what

307
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,920
does the acquisition do he makes more

308
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,660
money he doesn't have access to more

309
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,579
gold because to collect more gold would

310
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,140
increase taxation he didn't want to

311
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,420
increase taxation because doing so would

312
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,279
actually inspire Revolt so what does he

313
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,640
do he takes the coins that he already

314
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,680
has and adds cheaper Metals base Metals

315
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,019
into them to increase his monetary

316
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,899
Supply understand these terms monetary

317
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,380
Supply and then essentially this is a

318
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:16,740
policy of inflation he uses inflation to

319
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,160
steal away the savings of his citizens

320
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,959
that's what inflation is inflation is a

321
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,300
tax inflation is nothing more than

322
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,459
taxation the only thing is it's not old

323
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,140
word that's what inflation is and now

324
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:31,380
you must really consider what it means

325
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,019
when the biggest PhD macro economists

326
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,300
who run the Federal Reserve insists that

327
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,579
inflation is actually good for you and

328
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,600
that is good for the economy and it is

329
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:45,420
actually why we have Prosperity no they

330
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,519
lie to you to your face look upon what

331
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,100
happened to the Roman Empire when

332
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,839
inflationary policies were adopted now

333
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,279
you could actually excuse the Romans

334
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,360
they didn't understand economics to the

335
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,220
level that we do they didn't have the

336
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,660
data that we do today so you could

337
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,720
excuse the Romans for having an

338
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,519
inflationary policy but no such cues can

339
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,040
be made for those who run the Federal

340
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,019
Reserve now the question becomes who

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,060
runs the Federal Reserve and what their

342
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,740
true aims are and that's beyond the

343
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,720
scope of this video that's for sure now

344
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,760
let's look at why it is that it is men

345
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
who think of the Roman Empire every

346
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,180
single day and not women women are

347
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,160
completely Bamboozled by the fact that

348
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,620
we think of this all the time at least

349
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,380
once a week well to put it simply that's

350
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,240
the job that's the job it's not women's

351
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,160
job to think of the Roman Empire because

352
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,140
they are not in charge of defending the

353
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,180
nation against tyranny from within or

354
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,339
external threats Barbarians at the gate

355
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,079
we must think of these things so that

356
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,820
women do not have to think about these

357
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,220
things and of course the Roman Empire is

358
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,899
connected to everything that we see on a

359
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
daily basis this is not to say that

360
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,600
women don't have an important role to

361
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,760
perform in society of course they do

362
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,260
equally important as that of men or it's

363
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,940
just that the roles are different and

364
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,860
the responsibilities are different and

365
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,300
of course the biology is different we

366
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,700
think about different things man

367
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,459
gravitate to think about stuff things

368
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,079
Concepts ideas women tend to think more

369
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,940
about people cool relationships that's

370
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,959
fine that's not a bad thing neither is

371
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
better than the other there are

372
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,860
different purposes for the functioning

373
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,480
of a healthy Society indeed it is up to

374
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,820
men to think about the preservation of

375
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,139
tradition tradition is of course not the

376
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,839
worship of the ashes but the

377
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,880
preservation of flame you see all power

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
tends to tyranny and the Romans were the

379
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,060
best example of this the people who

380
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,740
hated Tyrion the most even became

381
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,660
tyrannized but of course this is

382
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,339
different in the Modern Age you see we

383
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,160
have Technologies which the Romans never

384
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,440
had so when our civilization it's not if

385
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,779
it's a when our civilization goes

386
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
towards a more tyrannical Direction the

387
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,920
technologies that the governments will

388
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,660
possess exceed anything that the Romans

389
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,240
ever had think about this the Roman

390
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,579
Empire Diocletian even he couldn't truly

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,980
change the currency that much because it

392
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,899
was physical gold or bronze whatever

393
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,360
coins that he tried to make right what

394
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,300
happens when the government enforces a

395
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,579
Central Banking cryptocurrency nothing

396
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,680
good that much assure you indeed it is

397
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:00,600
the role of men to look at these things

398
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,579
see the mistakes on the path and make

399
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,279
sure that we don't repeat them that's

400
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,740
the job that's the nature of it all it's

401
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,720
up to you to armor your body against the

402
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,820
xenotoxins and the xenoestrogens

403
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,980
inflicted Upon Us by the corporations

404
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,079
with the blessing of the government it

405
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,120
is up to you to train your mind against

406
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,579
the endless psychological operations

407
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,500
inflicted upon you by the powers that be

408
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,480
it is up to you to gather around

409
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,579
yourself men like yourself who have a

410
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
similar mindset and thinking and it is

411
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,200
up to you to contemplate the cycle of

412
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,660
civilizations and where in that

413
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,360
structure we lie but finally a word of

414
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,660
hope you see Rome wasn't built in a day

415
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,459
but nor was Rome burned in a day many

416
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,040
times when the Empire came close to

417
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:46,019
collapse a man arose to change the fate

418
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,300
of the Roman Empire think about the

419
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,760
restituter or best the restorer of the

420
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,279
world Aurelius the Roman Emperor

421
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,199
Aurelius changed the path of the Roman

422
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,899
Empire from one of their client to one

423
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,699
of great Fame and power again in just

424
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,680
four years he managed this and he would

425
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,920
the restored Rome to its former glory

426
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,240
has he not been assassinated by his own

427
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,339
bodyguard what about the emperor

428
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,680
stillico what about Diocletian these men

429
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,720
made massive strides in reversing the

430
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,779
decadence of their civilization and what

431
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,100
about Justinian Justinian was born in a

432
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,279
time when the Western the Roman Empire

433
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,100
completely collapsed and yet he sent his

434
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,440
best General belisarius to take back and

435
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,899
he almost succeeded he almost United the

436
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,120
great Empire once again almost just a

437
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,100
hairs with away from complete

438
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,540
restoration the greatest Romans were not

439
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,040
the ones who were born in the Heyday of

440
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,720
Rome but rather the ones were born in

441
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,600
darkness and brought forth the light

442
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,040
comment down below Roma in Victor and

443
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,420
give me the latest thought about the

444
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Roman Empire that you have had there's

445
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,899
no question as to why men think of the

446
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,820
Roman Empire every day that much is

447
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,320
obvious the real question is what the

448
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,320
hell do women think about all the time
