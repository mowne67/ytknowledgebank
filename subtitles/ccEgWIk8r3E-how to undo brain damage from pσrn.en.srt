1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,440
your brain functions exactly like this

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,719
tub of water so everybody has a dopamine

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,400
level this is their Baseline dopamine

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,040
you see this water level right here

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,240
everybody has waves of dopamine this is

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
completely normal it's healthy and in

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,760
fact the waves in dopamine that's what

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,160
allows you to actually pursue goals in

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,560
life and even be happy from the goals

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,240
that you pursue however when you have a

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,040
massive shock like how por or any other

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,440
addiction can cause you some of the

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,360
water will Splash out of this tub and

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,760
actually decrease your dopamine Baseline

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,239
level that's why addicts of all kinds

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,280
are not only miserable and sad and

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,199
depressed but also they struggle with

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,320
any kind of goal Pursuit you've

19
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,399
literally depleted their happiness

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,239
molecule You' have literally depleted

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,559
the molecule which makes them actually

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,520
do anything that's why they're so

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,879
unproductive it's not that they're bad

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,800
people it's literally that their brain

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,079
has been damaged by the addiction of

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,799
course I keep on saying they but it's

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,280
not they it's us it's you and me we have

28
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,560
addictions of our own it's us who are

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,600
struggling with these things the

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,600
information which I'm going to give you

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,799
in this video will destroy any addiction

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,759
that you have permanently and if it

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
doesn't come back to this video and give

34
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,720
me a dislike that's how sure I am that

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,360
this video is going to change things for

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,240
you when your mind has a desire your

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
dopamine level is going to go up and

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,240
here's the interesting thing as soon as

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,280
it goes up is actually going to go down

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,880
below Baseline so this is your Baseline

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,880
Baseline of dopamine so when it goes

42
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,439
down when you have a valley that's

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,600
actually when you have an urge to move

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
or perform an action this is what most

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,880
people don't know it's actually the

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,920
valley which causes pain and causes you

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,960
to take action literally causes movement

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,079
when you are in a dopamine Valley your

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,600
body literally wants to move towards the

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,240
goal that you're thinking of so for

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,479
example example say here I think of ice

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,560
cream there's a place not too far from

53
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,239
here called Freddy's and they have

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,920
really really good soft serve ice cream

55
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,879
they serve it in a waffle cone with like

56
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,360
chocolate and everything and I like the

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
vanilla bean flavor a lot so even

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,440
thinking of that I have a little bit of

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,760
saliva forming in my mouth even though I

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,959
don't have any food near me that's the

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,800
power of our mind right I'm thinking of

62
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,000
that ice cream that's caused a spike in

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
my dopamine and then that Spike

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,640
immediately reverses and now I'm in a

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,280
valley a declined level of dopamine this

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,360
makes me want to go and acquire that ice

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,519
cream and if I did go get that ice cream

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,680
my dopamine would go again up to

69
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:55,440
Baseline and hit that Peak and then it

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,440
would fall again back to Baseline and I

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,360
can continue my day so this is me

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,599
actually acquiring

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,360
the ice cream and so what happens with

74
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,920
por or any addiction is the same thing

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,640
you still have the thought of por which

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm just going to say p your dopamine is

77
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,560
going to go up and then fall down you're

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,760
going to be in pain this is going to be

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
your urge to actually go and watch

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,959
that's going to create you to actually

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
take action maybe pull out your phone

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,120
your laptop whatever it is and your

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,239
dopamine is going to go high but it's

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,480
not going to be like this is when you

85
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,439
when you watch p and you actually nut

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,879
that level of dopamine is going to be

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,120
massively high and when it crashes it

88
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,560
crashes all the way down and it doesn't

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,159
return to Baseline it stays low so

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,760
you're still stuck in this goal-seeking

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,360
mode so maybe you go and watch some

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
point again maybe you exceed Baseline

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
but then you're going to plummet even

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,640
lower and this time when you come up

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,200
your Baseline is even lower and then

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,120
you're still in pain you're still in the

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,760
goal-seeking mode and then you watch

98
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,239
again your dopamine sinks and your

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,959
Baseline is even lower now you're

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,480
absolutely [ __ ] cuz this is the kind

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,560
of dynamic which messes your prefrontal

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,360
CeX your brain is literally fried

103
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,920
because of this mechanism right here I'm

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,319
going to show you exactly the tools you

105
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,079
need to defeat this mechanism and break

106
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,519
the addiction forever now of course

107
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,639
self-control is important but let's put

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,080
the blame where it actually lies the POR

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,120
industry and the media literally know

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,320
how this system works and they have the

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
audacity to sit and cry about Mental

112
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,520
Health awareness week when they are the

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,039
ones who created the problem in the

114
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,360
first place the media not only

115
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,919
normalizes this filth but also

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,720
sexualizes every single damn thing think

117
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,080
about it like this 50 years ago the

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,400
media pushed cigarette smoking a lot of

119
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,880
young kids got into it like 15 14 13

120
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,440
year-old children got into it are you

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
going to blame these kids for getting

122
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,680
into smoking because they should have

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,400
had more self-control are you going to

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,000
put the blame are you going to put the

125
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,039
corps of these young people at the feet

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,120
of the media and the smoking companies

127
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,840
and the rotten scientists who propagated

128
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,080
incorrect sence saying that smoking was

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,680
correct these are the people who are to

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,120
blame not the people who are misled by

131
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,479
the media this is not about self-control

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,560
this is about using self-control to

133
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,199
defeat the psychological operation

134
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,080
that's being inflicted upon you for

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,000
example you might have heard this claim

136
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,280
that masturbation prevents prostate

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,280
cancer that's not true it's completely

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,240
BS so I've actually gone and read those

139
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,880
studies and it's very shoddy science

140
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,000
they use a bunch of surveys to come up

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,319
with this silly concept that it reduces

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,680
prostate cancer I don't trust it at all

143
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,560
imagine this there's only one or two

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,479
studies which even show this they're not

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
very good studies and media took these

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,960
two studies and then blew it up to the

147
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
point where almost everybody you ask

148
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,520
they think that masturbation is good for

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,080
you because it prevents prostate cancer

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,560
and it doesn't even factor into the

151
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,240
account nocturnal emissions so a healthy

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,199
human being a healthy human man if he

153
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,280
doesn't have sex and ejaculates he still

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,240
has a means to relieve that pressure the

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,479
body will literally ejaculate excess

156
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,000
semen at night when he's sleeping that's

157
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,440
completely healthy that's not Point

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,240
that's not masturbation but that's not

159
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,039
even a single factor in these studies

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,680
and the media still had the audacity to

161
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,520
go ahead and fill the minds of young men

162
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,960
to think that porn and masturbation is

163
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,639
actually good for them well it's

164
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,000
completely not the government should

165
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,680
have banned this Fil A long time ago

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,479
think about it the government's always

167
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,199
out to encroach upon your civil

168
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,240
liberties but no but PA is a free speech

169
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,160
issue we need to ban porn before the

170
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,479
Advent of AI generated porn and virtual

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,080
reality porn these two Ai and VR is

172
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,039
going to destroy it's going to destruct

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,680
the minds of young men and young women

174
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,759
if we are not careful about it you see

175
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,639
free speech is for the furthering of

176
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,560
political and scientific ideas which are

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
not commonly accepted P does not

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,120
contribute anything to science or

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,960
politics I don't know why it's

180
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,919
considered a free speech issue and then

181
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,240
of course I know what you're thinking

182
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,240
you're thinking well even if you ban

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,039
point it's not actually going to be

184
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,280
eliminated from the internet so what

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,240
think about this fenil and other harmful

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,240
drugs are banned that doesn't mean that

187
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,160
the these drugs Fentanyl and other drugs

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,599
are not available they have not

189
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,479
eliminated them but the band still is

190
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,599
effective in making it difficult to

191
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,720
access these drugs that's why we have

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
these banss in place we know the science

193
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,759
is very clear that porn is very very

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
detrimental to the health of young men

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,800
and women and yet for some reason it's

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,400
completely legal and even there's a

197
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,840
whole industry making money off this

198
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,639
filth if you have any pro porography

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,560
thoughts in your head I guarantee you

200
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,919
it's been implanted into you through a

201
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,120
psychological operation you must must

202
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,120
defeat the scop and when you do the buge

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,120
eyed mle men the snively bureaucrats and

204
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,199
the villainous media who think they run

205
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,759
this place they will fear you when you

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319
open your eyes imagine a future in which

207
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
our children our sons and daughter live

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,440
in a world where porn is a thing of the

209
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,720
past and even whatever remnants of porn

210
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,240
still exist on the internet they can

211
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,080
just ignore it because their mental

212
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,080
health and spiritual health is so high

213
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,879
that to them it looks like absolute

214
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,479
filth which is exactly what it is they

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,759
will use use science observation their

216
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,919
own intuition and philosophy to find out

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
what is true and what is false this is

218
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,800
the vision I have for the future and you

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,360
shall see it pass this is a

220
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,000
multi-generational psychological war and

221
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,759
you are their worst nightmare po drugs

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,120
alcohol addictions cigarette addictions

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,720
and even social media addictions attack

224
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,840
the prefrontal cortex this is the center

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,080
of control in your brain this is

226
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,319
essentially the seat of stoicism in your

227
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,840
brain and that is what all these

228
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,800
addictions directly attack so think

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,080
about this everything you lose against

230
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,000
your addiction your prefrontal cortex

231
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,440
takes a hit and becomes weaker your

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,959
dopamine levels and lower Baseline which

233
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,600
makes you more susceptible to losing

234
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,120
again literally this stuff makes you a

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
loser at a molecular level now that you

236
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,240
understand the enemy I'm going to give

237
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
you the weapons to fight them so listen

238
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,880
closely this is the part which is going

239
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,360
to destroy your addictions permanently

240
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,200
so the example with the ice cream I gave

241
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,600
you earlier was a little bit simplistic

242
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm going to go into finer details cuz

243
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,120
that's where you have leverage that's

244
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,640
where you can break the addiction so

245
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,920
we're starting off again we're just

246
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,519
going about our day and we think of the

247
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,200
ice cream all right we think about it we

248
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,920
don't actually acquire it this is

249
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,079
causing the spike in dopamine and like I

250
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,880
said is going to give you a fall in

251
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,920
dopamine and now of course when you

252
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
think of something and you get that urge

253
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,800
to get something you don't immediately

254
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,720
have it there's often a path of events

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,519
which you need to follow in order to get

256
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,240
it for example when I think of the ice

257
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,240
cream and I fall into this crash the

258
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,480
first thing I need to do is grab my car

259
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,839
keys so as soon as I grab my car keys I

260
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,320
have a little peak of dopamine that's

261
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,640
right and then I have another Valley of

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,240
dopamine so I'm actually deeper than I

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,880
was before and then I get into my car

264
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,680
that's another step towards the goal

265
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,240
right so I have another peak in dopamine

266
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,800
and another deeper Valley of dopamine

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,160
then I get to Freddy's which is the

268
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,600
place where I love getting their ice

269
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,800
cream when once I get there and see

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,360
their board I see another thir increase

271
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,480
in dopamine and another fall and then I

272
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,200
actually order the ice cream get another

273
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,360
Peak another fall I actually get the ice

274
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,640
cream another Peak another fall each

275
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,959
step of the way I'm getting into more

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,920
and more pain and see how far away I am

277
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,640
from my dopamine Baseline that is how

278
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,600
difficult the urge is to control

279
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,959
essentially that's how less resistance

280
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,200
you have basically speaking it's very

281
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,120
very difficult for me at this point to

282
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,160
not eat the ice cream it was easier back

283
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,160
back then when I just had the thought so

284
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,680
when I'm here and I finally get the ice

285
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,240
cream and I take my first Big Lick

286
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,680
massive massive spike in dopamine go all

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,440
the way past Baseline and then because

288
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,279
I'm not addicted to ice cream you know I

289
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,880
enjoy ice cream but I don't like go

290
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:50,000
crazy about ice cream with time I'll

291
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,519
just come back back to Baseline and I'll

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
be back to normal and that's the end of

293
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,200
the story for ice cream but it's

294
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,519
different for porn when it comes to porn

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,480
so I'm putting big p for for I get the

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,920
desire to watch it I have the spike I

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,399
have the decline and what do I do maybe

298
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
I pick up my laptop I get that little

299
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,480
Spike of dopamine and that sends me to a

300
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,680
new Valley maybe I open a browser new

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Peak New Valley maybe I type ww. new

302
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,639
Peak New Valley maybe I type

303
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,240
www.p new Peak New Valley maybe I

304
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,040
finally go to the dreaded website and

305
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
then I have another Peak and another

306
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,959
Valley and what happens here is the

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,680
difference when you watch por and

308
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,600
literally nut that is the ultimate

309
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,160
dopamine release because in prehistoric

310
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
times that was a good thing you know you

311
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,399
want to impregnate a woman to further

312
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
your literal children further your

313
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,320
literal ancestry further your literal

314
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
lineage so of course you get a massive

315
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,560
surgeon dopamine far above anything

316
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,160
which ice cream can give you right so

317
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,880
instead of just stopping at the ice

318
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,160
cream Peak you actually go way way way

319
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,880
higher and then when you crash you crash

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,040
really bad and here's the difference

321
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,720
between like actual real sex with a

322
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,240
woman you love versus poor if you have

323
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,760
sex with an actual woman you love and

324
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,360
you ejaculate that's fine you'll come

325
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,760
back to Baseline because that was a

326
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,639
productive activity and your body knows

327
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,920
it with P you are obviously dissatisfied

328
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,399
with what you got that means when you

329
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,000
come back you're actually not at

330
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,320
Baseline you're below Baseline and now

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,800
you're in trouble cuz you're below

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
Baseline your brain is still thinking I

333
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,079
still haven't acquired the goal I still

334
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
haven't had the result which I desired

335
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,440
so what do you do you might actually

336
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,160
have a new urge that's right this is

337
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,000
where the problem starts you have a new

338
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,920
urge and a new Valley now what happens

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,680
you're in the goal Pursuit mode again

340
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
but this time it's worse because this

341
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,120
time you're at a lower Baseline than you

342
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,399
were before and now you're really now if

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,800
you have the same Cascade of events

344
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,839
you go down down down and then say you

345
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,399
watch Point again and you have a new

346
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,800
Peak this peak is going to be actually

347
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,440
lower than the previous Peak and this

348
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,000
time the valley is going to be even

349
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,800
deeper than the previous Valley ever was

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,440
and then you're again lower than

351
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,880
Baseline This Time by a huge margin and

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,199
then this of course will continue and

353
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,320
you're at this point cuz you're going to

354
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,240
go down this hill this is going to go

355
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,839
worse and worse and worse and every time

356
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,519
it happens going to be harder and harder

357
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,760
for you to resist the temptation now

358
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,519
your question should be how do you fix

359
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,079
it how do you break the addiction well

360
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,079
I'm going to show you right now so how

361
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,360
do you get rid of your porn addiction or

362
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,040
any addiction forever this is how you do

363
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,680
it so let's understand addiction again

364
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,120
so first you have an urge you get the

365
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,880
dopamine Spike you fall below Baseline

366
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,639
and then smaller Peaks happen as you get

367
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,040
closer and closer to the goal and you

368
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
have a massive Peak when you hit the

369
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,320
goal and because it's an addiction you

370
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,240
never really come back to Baseline and

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,279
you repeat this cycle again and again

372
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,720
until you basically ruin your life where

373
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,160
is this cycle the most vulnerable think

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,880
of that where is the cycle the most

375
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,800
vulnerable you don't really have any

376
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,959
control about when you get the urge

377
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,199
because you know your mind just throws

378
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,320
an urge at you and it's not in your

379
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,320
control you actually have the most

380
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,600
control in the first Peak this is where

381
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
you strike because think about it until

382
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,399
this point you don't really have any

383
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,040
control you cannot control what thought

384
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,240
comes into your head you can only

385
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:37,639
control what you do about those thoughts

386
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:40,600
so until here we have no control but we

387
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,320
do have our first line of control in the

388
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,199
first Valley so what is the first Valley

389
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,079
the first time you feel pain and you

390
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,199
have an an urge to move and perform an

391
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,959
action towards your goal that's when you

392
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
attack so when you have an urge to watch

393
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,839
and you have an urge to pick up your

394
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,600
phone that's when you strike or when you

395
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,880
have an urge to go go to your laptop

396
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,079
that's when you strike you literally say

397
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,959
with your mouth you say the word no you

398
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,079
say it with courage with boldness like a

399
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,279
military commander you say no you don't

400
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,759
have to yell it you don't have to

401
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,000
whisper it you just say no and you

402
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,040
shortcircuit it right in this spot when

403
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,160
you have the first incling of movement

404
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,959
or action towards that goal that's when

405
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,040
you destroy it you say no and you don't

406
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,160
take another step towards that goal

407
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,040
because if you take another step what

408
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
happens you go back into the spiral and

409
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,360
you're stuck in this spiral forever

410
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,720
right you Short Circuit the entire

411
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,839
mechanism by attacking it when you first

412
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,399
get a sensation towards action and what

413
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
happens if you break it right here what

414
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,639
happens if when you have an urge to pick

415
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
up your phone and go to the browser or

416
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,160
pick up your laptop and go to the

417
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
browser and you say no what happens then

418
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,800
if you take nothing else from this video

419
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,399
get this when you're in a valley if you

420
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,399
give it time you'll come back to

421
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,199
Baseline pretty quick in like 5 minutes

422
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,399
you'll come back to Baseline so when you

423
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,360
get the first urge to get your phone out

424
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,360
and you say no you literally have to say

425
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,759
the word no alloud so that you can hear

426
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,360
it because that signals to your brain

427
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,079
you hear the word no you hear a command

428
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,079
you giving yourself a command you give

429
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,560
the command no and you don't do anything

430
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,639
you literally stay sitting you don't do

431
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,480
anything you literally say no and just

432
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,639
stay put and don't do anything for 5

433
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,240
minutes if you do that your dopamine is

434
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,160
going to raise up back to Baseline and

435
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,959
then you're just back to Baseline you're

436
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,800
fine if you're at Baseline you're good

437
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,079
there's no urge at Baseline and then you

438
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,480
just continue at Baseline until another

439
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,199
thought comes into your head maybe you

440
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,800
know like in 5 hours or something

441
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,199
another time your brain is like hey hey

442
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,519
maybe you want to watch por and then you

443
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,160
get another Peak and you get another

444
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,519
Valley and again at that point when

445
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,560
you're picking up your phone you say no

446
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,199
and then you short circuit it again you

447
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,240
just return back to Baseline so you

448
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,160
don't have this Cascade effect you just

449
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,759
have a peak a valley and come back to

450
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,519
Baseline that's all that happens so if

451
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,160
you do this for long enough you just go

452
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,160
Peak Valley Baseline Peak Valley

453
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Baseline you destroy your addiction you

454
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,759
straight up destroy your addiction for

455
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,800
the rest of your life because your brain

456
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,120
has learned your brain has learned that

457
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,079
this is not a reward worth seeking and

458
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,600
that's it you're done you'll never be

459
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,160
addicted to it another time in your life

460
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,120
ever again I've given you a semester's

461
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,400
worth of knowledge with regards to

462
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,400
dopamine circuitry how do you absorb

463
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,400
this information so it's not the value I

464
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
provide to you it's not the value I

465
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,280
provide it's the value you absorb you

466
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
need to absorb the stuff which I gave

467
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
you otherwise there's no point you

468
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,799
aren't going to actually implement it

469
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,240
this is what I want you to do I want you

470
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,000
to go to the comments and literally do a

471
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,120
homework assignment the homework for

472
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
today is think about the last time you

473
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,559
relapsed or last time you lapsed on

474
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,160
whatever addiction you have and I want

475
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,039
you to analyze the steps you took before

476
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,720
your addiction got the better of you in

477
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,799
the framework of this dopamine circuit

478
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
which I showed you and analyze what was

479
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,799
happening so literally I want you to

480
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,440
write a paragraph saying step by step

481
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,400
what was going in your in your mind what

482
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,400
you physically performed and what was

483
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
going on with regards to dopamine and I

484
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,919
I will go ahead and grade you I will

485
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,960
come to the comment section and grade

486
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,600
your homework if you do this I guarantee

487
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,000
you you've understood this concept well

488
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,000
enough that the next time a urge hits

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,360
you you have the upper hand you can

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,080
attack where it is weak and that is how

491
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,880
you defeat addiction forever if you do

492
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
everything I told you and you still go

493
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,480
back and watch then I want you to come

494
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,840
back and do this give me a dislike give

495
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,320
me a dislike and then in the comments

496
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,760
write down how you fail like exactly

497
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,000
autistic level detail how you failed so

498
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
that others May learn from your mistake

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,720
and understand this the dopamine circuit

500
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
is not a bad thing the dopamine circuit

501
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,080
is actually the best part of your brain

502
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,039
it's the it's a center of motivation the

503
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,679
center of happiness and this is what

504
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,640
actually gives you massive success and

505
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,640
happiness in life this is the circuit

506
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,240
which they literally hijack and ruin

507
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
your life the dopamine system is

508
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,480
actually a learning system so imagine

509
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,480
this you're back in caveman days and

510
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,400
you're feeling hungry you have a spike

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,880
in dopamine and then you have a dip in

512
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,559
dopamine what do you do then you go

513
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,840
outside the comfort of your Village and

514
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,679
you see that there's deer dropping so

515
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,880
you see deer tracks that gives you a

516
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,120
small spike in dopamine and then you

517
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,960
have a deeper Valley maybe you see the

518
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,159
the leaves rustling or the grass is

519
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,720
moving another a spike because you think

520
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,159
maybe the deer is there and then you

521
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,320
have another a deeper Valley now you're

522
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,159
getting anxious you're getting pain you

523
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,320
want to hunt that deer right then you

524
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,080
pull out your bow you're aiming at what

525
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,480
you think is the deer you have another

526
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,000
Peak cuz you're thinking you're going to

527
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,400
succeed and then you have another Valley

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,640
and then you see it you see the deer and

529
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,799
you let the arrow go and the bolt gets

530
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
it right in the neck success that's a

531
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,280
peak and a valley then you go and

532
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,840
confirm that you got the deer and then

533
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,679
you take it back to your village massive

534
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,840
massive success massive release of

535
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,120
dopamine all your brothers are you know

536
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,120
patting you in the back great hunt great

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,720
job all the women in the village are

538
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
like oh that's a good Hunter maybe I

539
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,520
need to date him and then of course the

540
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,240

succeeded in the hunt congratulations

543
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
and then what happens you get the

544
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,440
success uccess your reputation has

545
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
increased your essentially your wealth

546
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,360
in the village has increased and then

547
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,280
because it's an Adaptive experience

548
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,520
you'll return to Baseline nice and slow

549
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,200
you'll come back to Baseline and then

550
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,520
maybe this time your Baseline is

551
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,799
actually a bit higher than it was before

552
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,799
so instead of the effect where you have

553
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,760
a lower Baseline than before maybe this

554
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,919
time you're actually higher and the next

555
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,480
time you do this you actually better

556
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,080
maybe you don't have to go through every

557
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,200
single step to get the deer next time

558
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,640
you see the wrestling boom you got the

559
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
deer that way you're actually increasing

560
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,280
your Baseline every time you hunt and

561
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
get better and better at hunting that's

562
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,640
how you learn and perfect a skill your

563
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,919
dopamine circuit actually helps you

564
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
perfect skills but nowadays what happens

565
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,000
nowadays what happens is you get your

566
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,200
phone you see some dumb B to working on

567
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,120
Tik Tok and you have an urge you go to

568
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,480
porub you freaking what's some and then

569
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,600
your dopamine drops and then you do that

570
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,360
again your dopamine drops again and

571
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,080
again until you're completely brain dead

572
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,039
your prefrontal cortex is fried you're

573
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,320
basically lobotomized slave you're

574
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,799
basically a cator this is the mental

575
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,200
prison which they've built for you and

576
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,080
think about it like this if you were a

577
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,720
prison Warden and the inmates were

578
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,240
getting a bit unrestful you know they're

579
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,760
getting a little bit Rowdy right what

580
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,640
would you do you cannot just use

581
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,240
violence because if you and like the 10

582
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,840
other guards you have go out and try to

583
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
fight the inmates you'd lose because

584
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,760
there's like 10,000 of them what you

585
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,720
might want to do instead is resort to

586
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,039
chemical and psychological warfare maybe

587
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,480
first you destroy the inmates dopamine

588
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,840
systems using psychology and maybe then

589
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,679
you prescribe to them anti-depressants

590
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,960
and mess up their circuitry forever and

591
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,080
then maybe you make money selling them

592
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,880
anti-depressants which don't fix the

593
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,840
cause of the depression they only mask

594
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,279
the symptoms there are quite a few

595
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,400
tactics and weapons in the bag of

596
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,799
chemical and psychological warfare but

597
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,799
you have some weapons too literally the

598
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,679
sun is your ally in my esoteric sleep

599
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,640
guide I I briefly talk about how the Sun

600
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,000
boosts your dopamine levels but now you

601
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,120
have a pretty good understanding of the

602
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,360
dopamine circuitry so what the sun does

603
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,760
is actually very very remarkable when

604
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
you get out in the morning this is

605
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,000
especially effective in the morning you

606
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,000
wake up obviously you brush your teeth

607
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,039
drink your electrolytes go to the

608
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
bathroom and then what you do step out

609
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,960
into the sun expose your eyes and skin

610
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,919
towards the Sun not necessarily looking

611
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,919
at the sun just towards the Sun and this

612
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,360
is going to recharge your dopamine if

613
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,120
you get good sleep that's already a

614
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,600
powerful dopamine recharge but then you

615
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,720
look at the Sun and your dopamine level

616
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,000
your Baseline dopamine level is at a

617
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,480
whole new level and you a different

618
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,840
person than you were the previous day

619
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,679
and not only that when you get out into

620
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,760
the Sun that literally stimulates your

621
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,760
pineal gland which is the center of

622
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,000
sexual energy for any man or woman for

623
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,520
that matter if you take nothing else

624
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,080
from this video understand how to break

625
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,000
your addictions and then go out into the

626
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,480
sun that's all I have to ask you that's

627
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,440
literally all I have to ask you are

628
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,400
there any supplements you can take to

629
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,360
fix your dopamine system absolutely not

630
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,039
there are fools out there prescribing

631
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,080
supplements to fix your dopamine systems

632
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,720
don't do it because you don't want

633
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,200
another dependency when you're trying to

634
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,279
fix your dopamine instead invest some

635
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,440
time in ex exercise literally resistance

636
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,200
training or cardiovascular exercise is

637
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,360
going to up your Baseline dopamine I'm

638
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,279
not talking about Peaks and troughs I'm

639
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,840
talking about literally increase in your

640
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,480
Baseline and the higher you can get your

641
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
Baseline man the more success you're

642
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,000
going to have literally success in

643
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,679
literally everything business money

644
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,120
women whatever you want it comes from

645
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,960
your Baseline dopamine and what's

646
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,279
another way cold showers do actually

647
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,919
work they do generally increase dopamine

648
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,520
for about 6 hours it's not like a

649
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,200
permanent increase in dopamine but you

650
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,320
know 6 hours is not bad like you have 6

651
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,279
hours of extremely productive time after

652
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,720
your C shower in the morning just to

653
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,799
drill this into your head how do you

654
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
break an addiction you break the

655
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,080
addiction as soon as you feel an urge to

656
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,440
move and act towards that goal which

657
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,320
could be smoking a cigarette could be

658
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,919
drinking alcohol could be watching porn

659
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,559
could be any number of things as soon

660
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,279
soon as you feel an urge to move and

661
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,520
perform an action you literally say no

662
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,080
you say the word no nice and loud and

663
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,480
firm and clear and then you just sit

664
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,320
down or you just continue doing

665
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,159
something else you literally do not

666
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,159
entertain the slightest movement or

667
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,960
slightest action towards that goal and

668
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,840
you will come back to Baseline and do

669
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,159
this three or four times five or six

670
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,400
times seven or eight times how many

671
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,120
times it takes and your addiction

672
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,400
literally your brain chemistry and

673
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,919
rewiring is going to change and you'll

674
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,880
never be addicted to that substance

675
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,919
again do you want to be a part of my

676
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
conspiracy here's what I want you to do

677
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,919
hit that share button but don't

678
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,320
necessarily share it with anybody if you

679
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,440
want to that's fine but what you do is

680
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,960
you copy the link which you get from the

681
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,159
share button just copy it because

682
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
YouTube doesn't know whether you shared

683
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,159
it with somebody or not YouTube just

684
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,880
thinks that you have shared this video

685
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,880
that think that makes YouTube think that

686
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,399
this is a banger video and that means

687
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,919
it's going to shove this video into the

688
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,640
faces of other men just like you and I

689
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,039
know that this video is going to destroy

690
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,200
their po addiction as well this is how

691
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm waging psychological warfare back on

692
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,399
them and you can help me by doing this

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,919
and I will end with a visualization just

694
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,559
close your eyes and hear these words you

695
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,159
are their worst nightmare imagine a

696
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,720
legion of men resistant to psychological

697
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,640
operations and completely maxed out on

698
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,760
on their testosterone such a force

699
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,120
cannot be reasoned with cannot be

700
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,360
bargained with or defeated you are the

701
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,240
Vanguard you are working on your dream

702
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,240
project but it's difficult you don't

703
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,559
know how to proceed you're at a bit of a

704
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,399
dead end you have some kind of knowledge

705
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,520
Gap you don't know how to navigate and

706
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,039
you feel a sensation that you haven't

707
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,880
felt in a while a base desire for

708
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,159
instant gratification you've not watched

709
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,720
porn in months and haven't thought about

710
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,720
it in weeks it wouldn't hurt right it

711
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,840
wouldn't hurt to take a quick break

712
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,880
surely in fact it might make you even

713
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,320
more productive right you feel a

714
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,200
sensation to move your mouse cursor

715
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,520
towards the browser tab but before even

716
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,279
a single millimeter of movement a sound

717
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,039
escapes your mouth almost involuntarily

718
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:51,799
a single syllable crisp and clear

719
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:54,279
leaving no doubt as to its meaning no no

720
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,640
you do not yield you do not break you do

721
00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:00,039
not move the dopamine death spiral that

722
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,240
used to rule your life life is weaker it

723
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,200
grows weaker every time you refuse to

724
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,159
feed it it is not dead yet and will try

725
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,120
again to ins snare you but your dreams

726
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,760
are too important and you spit in its

727
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,520
face you are finished with such

728
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:20,039
trivialities you have a legacy to build

729
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,039
discipline is
