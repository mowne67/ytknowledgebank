1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,040
is stoicism holding you back let me ask

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,480
this question in a different way has

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,799
anything great ever been achieved

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,360
through stoicism has stoicism inspired

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,080
great art or great architecture has it

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,080
fueled great warriors has it fired

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,279
passionate love stoicism is the

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,119
internet's favorite philosophy and let's

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,760
see if it lives up to the hype most

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,000
people don't know this but stoicism

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
shouldn't be considered a philosophy but

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,400
more so a strategy and if you don't

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,400
understand the difference between the

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,840
two then stoicism can actually hold you

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,239
back from your true potential stoicism

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
in its purest Essence is if you can do

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,040
something about it then go right ahead

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,120
if you cannot do something about it then

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,760
you have to accept it and move on this

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,440
can be expressed in the form of a prayer

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,360
give me the courage to control that

22
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,480
which I can give me the strength to

23
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,920
accept that which I cannot and give me

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,600
the knowledge to tell that difference

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,039
this shows the greatest strengths of

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,920
storis it's Simplicity but also its

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,199
greatest weakness the flaw in stoicism

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,120
lies in the third sentence give me the

29
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,159
knowledge to tell the difference I think

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,040
this is where stoicism really falls

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,759
short and I'll explain by looking at the

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,000
history not just of Marcus Aurelius the

33
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,200
stoic Emperor but also of Lucius aurelan

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,640
the restorer of the world everybody on

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,119
this side of the internet knows the name

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,759
of Marcus Aurelius the great emperor of

37
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,840
Rome who ruled with Justice honor and

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,720
Duty around 200 ad we are aware of the

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,720
book meditations which is his personal

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,360
diary which serves as the gateway book

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,040
in into stoicism Marcus aurelus can be

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,280
considered a true embodiment of the

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Greek ideal of the philosopher king when

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,479
I was in Rome last year I was walking

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,119
around in the city and I saw this

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
massive marble column there was no crowd

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,439
around it there was no hype around it

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,960
there's no information panels around it

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,040
and and even tourists didn't really

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,640
bother taking pictures of it but I knew

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,039
what it was it was the column of Marcus

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,600
Aus it shows in its carvings the many

53
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,560
Battlefield triumphs of Marcus Marcus

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,960
had to fight brutal Wars against the

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,640
germanics in the north the parthians to

56
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,560
the East and of course he had to face

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,920
the antonine plague this plague did more

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,840
damage to the Roman army and the economy

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,239
than any enemy on top of this Marcus was

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,080
in constant personal pain he was not a

61
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,000
very healthy man he had some kind of a

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,400
chronic illness or perhaps it was just

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,040
the stress of his duties as the emperor

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,120
soon after Marcus aelius died the Empire

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,120
started to crumble there were 40

66
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,080
Emperors in just the next years and we

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,959
got a new emperor every 2 years in

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,640
contrast Marcus ruled for 20 continuous

69
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,760
years after Marcus we had Commodus

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,519
Marcus's [ __ ] up son who was so messed

71
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,840
up in the head that he literally did

72
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,560
this he rounded up some guys who are

73
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,440
handicapped so people who had lost their

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,480
legs and he put them in snake costumes

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
and he made them wriggle around and then

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,200
he proceeded to beat the [ __ ] out of

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
them with a club yeah so messed in the

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,280
head then we had carala who was a great

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
Soldier but he does a lot of damage to

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,720
Rome by De de basing the currency and

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,959
giving all the gold to the generals then

82
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,360
we had elagabalus who literally was a

83
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,480
prostitute he literally prostituted

84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,200
himself to his guards and his soldiers

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
he even got the doctors to give him a

86
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,840
sex change operation which they refused

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,799
to do but still like this was the kind

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,360
of Rome that it became after the reign

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,879
of Marcus and this is why Marcus is

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
remembered with a lot of respect because

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
in his Reign things were actually pretty

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,480
good but now the currency was worthless

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
the military was weak and demoralized

94
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,439
people had lost any trust in the

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,360
government and the religion was

96
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,200
corrupted and this was the Empire that

97
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,040
Lucius aelan took control of about 100

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,319
years after the death of Marcus Aurelius

99
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,159
this was an Empire of degeneracy Decay

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,360
and Corruption the people of Rome were

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,760
driven mad by drinking water from lead

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,560
pipes rampant uncontrolled immigration

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,799
meant that the original Roman stock was

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
being replaced and global cooling was

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,840
happening that was destroying grain and

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,959
food production on top of this new rival

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,000
Powers were getting stronger we had the

108
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,360
polymarine Empire to the east led by

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,079
Zenobia who is apparently a certified

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,239
hottie according to the historical

111
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,560
record and we have the new threats in

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,879
the north the gods and the vandals in

113
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,000
the west we had the gallic tribes today

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,479
we talk about the decline of the us and

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,079
we talk about inflation eating our

116
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,919
savings we're talking about China

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,799
getting stronger and stronger we talk

118
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,199
about all this stuff but it's all

119
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,600
happened once before and much worse this

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,720
was the Empire that Lucius took control

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
of and yet Lucius was able to bring

122
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,400
bring the Empire back to its former

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,199
glory in Just 4 years so who was this

124
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,479
Lucian aelan and why am I hyping him up

125
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,800
let's look at his origin story Lucius

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,759
was not born into Power he was not in

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
line to the throne by a long shot he was

128
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,160
a regular and listed soldier who was so

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,880
damn good at his job that he rose up the

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,000
ranks and eventually became a general

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,880
then the emperor himself this should

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,479
have been impossible a rational man

133
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,240
couldn't have done it but IUS was not a

134
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
rational man a rational man controls

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,560
that which he can and accepts that which

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,000
he cannot a rational man would have

137
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,199
looked at the state of the Roman Empire

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in 270 ad and decided that this dumpster

139
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,520
fire could not possibly be controlled

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,319
this was a fallen Empire and just 10

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,039
years ago Emperor Valyrian was captured

142
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,680
by the Persians imagine how [ __ ] up

143
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,000
that situation is that's as though the

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,240
president of the United States get

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,840
captured by China like that's an

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,400
unbelievable thing but that is what

147
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,960
happened to Rome Emperor Valyrian was

148
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,000
captured by the Persians tortured made

149
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,520
into a foot stool and skinned alive

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,960
According to some references the

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,800
rational man would have taken the path

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,800
of stoicism the best I can do is slow

153
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,240
the decline and push back the end times

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,440
but there's a thing Lucius was not the

155
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,120
rational man he said [ __ ] it we ball and

156
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,240
he did ball in 4 years he managed to

157
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,560
undo about 100 Years of corruption

158
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,440
military defeat and stagnation that's

159
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,039
the mindset of a winner now let me make

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
sure you understand the greatness of

161
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,720
this man he destroyed the alamani the

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
gods the vandals and the sarmatians and

163
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,639
the jangi in the north then he took all

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,360
his forces to the east crushed Zenobia

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,599
and the pal Marines and then he went to

166
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,520
the GIC Empire in the west somewhere

167
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,960
along all this he also commissioned the

168
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,599
building of the aelan walls around Rome

169
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,000
that still stand today he even fixed the

170
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,720
currency system and reversed inflation

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
by moving back to the true gold standard

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
imagine the balls it takes to do that

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,639
and all of possible because he was

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,080
completely consumed by the vital energy

175
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,639
this was a man who ran on electricity

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,599
this was the Man Against Time able to

177
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
harness the destructive power of the

178
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,919
Roman cavalry charge but also the

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,120
creative power of the Roman industry and

180
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,800
it couldn't have done this if he was a

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
stoic and now you think I'm going to be

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,240
misrepresenting stoicism because I don't

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,639
understand it well let's see let's paint

184
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,520
the best picture of stoicism that we can

185
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,599
stoicism is the wisdom to know that

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,800
there are things outside one's control

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,039
in Marcus ais's meditation he talks

188
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,280
about the only thing you can really

189
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,639
control is the internal you can only

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,280
control the self and this idea of

191
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,879
Virtues or virtue as we would call it

192
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,520
his idea was at the end of the day the

193
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,960
only thing that matters is being a

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,400
virtuous man doing the right thing no

195
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,000
matter what the pressure or The

196
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,199
Temptations to put it simply stoicism

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,720
says control that which you can but have

198
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,680
the strength to accept that which you

199
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,599
cannot however to do this you need the

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
knowledge to know the difference the

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,599
thing is you don't have that knowledge

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
and this is the main flaw of stoicism

203
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,240
you don't know what's within your

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,479
control if Lucius aelan looked at the

205
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Hard facts the evidence and the rational

206
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,840
arguments he would have concluded that

207
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,400
the Roman Empire was beyond doomed he

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
would have resorted to a defensive

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,520
mindset and that is exactly what

210
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,599
stoicism is it is a defensive mindset it

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,280
was because Lucius took the offensive

212
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,520
that he was successful it is because he

213
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,680
had irrational Faith rather than cold

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,039
logic that he could do the impossible

215
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,159
even today Elon Musk is he a stoic

216
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
absolute Ely not I just finished reading

217
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,520
his book his new biography by Walter

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,000
Isaacson and I am blown away by the

219
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,840
impossibility of musk's achievement if

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,680
musk looked at the world as a cold and

221
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,759
logical place if he looked at it in fact

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
as an engineer then he would not have

223
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,080
been able to build SpaceX or Tesla let

224
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,639
alone both at the same time stoicism as

225
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,840
a life philosophy cannot lead to great

226
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,000
success stoicism is focused on the

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,240
internal not the external this is

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,279
literally the core tenant of St ISM put

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,200
forward by Zeno himself but here's the

230
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,279
thing focusing on the internal does not

231
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,279
drive change Blind Faith irrational

232
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,279
optimism and pure passion are what Drive

233
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,360
change let me explain this in a slightly

234
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,640
different way if you're learning boxing

235
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,000
and you're getting really good at

236
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,160
defense in the ring you have your chin

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,640
down you have your elbows up because you

238
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,480
obviously don't want to get clocked in

239
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,560
the face and to be fair this strategy

240
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,560
works you minimize the damage but you

241
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,880
will never win with a pure defense

242
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,880
strategy you will never win in order to

243
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,000
throw a punch you have to put down your

244
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,000
defense for a second and risk getting

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,600
punched in the process stoicism is a

246
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,760
shield everybody has times in their life

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,399
while they think things are hopeless

248
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,000
they say when it rains it pours and I

249
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,760
get it sometimes all you can do is stand

250
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,279
and take the punches sometimes all you

251
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,800
can do is just use the mental Shield of

252
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,680
stoicism and say this is just outside my

253
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,000
control I'll just accept it for what it

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,640
is and do my duty and my point isn't

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
that stoicism is bad or useless far from

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
it it's highly useful my point is simply

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,560
that it is one strategy a defensive

258
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,839
strategy that makes sense in special

259
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,440
circumstances while things are genuinely

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
outside your control one example is just

261
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,200
death people die family members die

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,519
friends die pets die and there's nothing

263
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,760
you can do after somebody is dead there

264
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,360
is no hope in this case there is only

265
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,320
acceptance another example is the things

266
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,399
in the past you cannot change the past

267
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,480
no matter how powerful you are it is

268
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,000
truly outside our control Faith and Hope

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,880
cannot change it the only way forward is

270
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,200
acceptance but other than the past and

271
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,120
death there is a lot that is within our

272
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,560
control it is better to assume that

273
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,440
things are within our control we as

274
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,160
humans have a bias towards the status

275
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,320
quo we are not risk-seeking creatures so

276
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,360
we must actively seek to push oursel

277
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,079
into thinking that we have more control

278
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,440
than what our logical brain tells us so

279
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,880
I am not willing to stoically accept the

280
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,120
world in which I I'm born into so let me

281
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,519
drive passionately towards the future

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
that I want let me feel the pain of

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,920
existence as a gift he who can

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
experience the deepest sorrow can rise

285
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,760
to the greatest Heights I know I'm going

286
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,079
to get a lot of comments saying well

287
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,440
stoicism doesn't tell you to be passive

288
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,399
and that's technically true but stoicism

289
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,880
doesn't get you fired up it doesn't have

290
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,760
any aggression within it stoicism is a

291
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,600
defensive mindset that's just the truth

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
of it and even if you read the original

293
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,639
works of epicus it is a defensive

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,680
mindset it does doesn't have Fire Within

295
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,920
it and it made sense for the Greeks and

296
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,000
the Romans because those men had so much

297
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Fire Within them that you kind of needed

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,519
something to place a damper on it to

299
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,040
kind of control it our men our modern

300
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,079
world does not have men of great fire

301
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,480
it's quite the opposite we're we're just

302
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,639
normally passive so we need the opposite

303
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
we need the fire we need a worldview

304
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,920
that actively rages against passivity

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
and stoicism simply does not do that

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,519
even now you might think that I don't

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,320
fully understand stoicism and so I

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,440
criticize it but I do understand it my

309
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,160
point isn't that stoicism has some

310
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,200
logical flaw in fact it doesn't have a

311
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,480
logical flaw it's actually the perfect

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
philosophy and there in lies the problem

313
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,800
the human mind is not a computer if the

314
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,560
human mind could process if then

315
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,200
statements if the human mind was a

316
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,839
perfectly logical machine then stoicism

317
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,040
would be the ideal operating system if

318
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,040
humans had perfect knowledge of our own

319
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,399
capabilities and the full knowledge of

320
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,160
the externalities then stoicism would be

321
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,399
the perfect algorithm but that is simply

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,279
not the case stoicism should be used as

323
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,720
a last resort strategy when everything

324
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,680
is going bad too many young men snuff

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,000
out the Fire Within them because they

326
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,240
think it is virtuous to Bear the burdens

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,079
placed upon them I know the ideas which

328
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm sharing in this video kind of go

329
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,000
against the common wisdom of the

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,519
masculinity space but the history of

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,079
philosophy actually supports my view

332
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,839
Roman stoicism gained strength when the

333
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,360
Empire had crossed its peak was in a

334
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,680
Time of decline it would be historically

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,519
accurate to say that Roman stoicism was

336
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,360
born in an era not of Hope and growth

337
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,519
but of stagnation and decline also

338
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,880
stoicism works best in a society that

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,160
tells you exactly what your duty is

340
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,600
because if your duty is St in stone you

341
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
might as well deal with it the best you

342
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,160
can in Roman times if you were the son

343
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
of a baker then you would learn how to

344
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
bake if you were the son of a cobbler

345
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,320
you would know how to make shoes if

346
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,760
you're born a slave then tough luck you

347
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,040
might as well get used to it cuz you're

348
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,519
going to die a slave you could see here

349
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,279
how stalis would be an amazing

350
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,839
Philosophy for the time when you really

351
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,240
cannot do much about your surroundings

352
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
or your circumstances stoicism is the

353
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,839
best but here's the thing stoicism

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,560
teaches you how to Bear heavy loads but

355
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,519
does not teach you what loads to Bear

356
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,240
now coming back to the initial question

357
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,720
is stoicism cope again we look at

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,920
history epicus was a slave he had zero

359
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,680
control over his life and he needed a

360
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,120
cope senica was not technically a slave

361
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,360
but he was in the court of Nero so he

362
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,279
was a subject of the random whims of a

363
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,199
Madman he had zero control over his life

364
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,680
he was exiled at random by Nero he was

365
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,320
executed at random by Nero he needed a

366
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,079
cope but what about Marcus aelius he was

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,120
an emperor of Rome surely he is the

368
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:57,320
opposite of a slave well not so Marcus

369
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,399
Aurelius was a slave to his position he

370
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,800
couldn't quit he couldn't even take a

371
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,399
break 20 years of Relentless work man

372
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,360
not a single weekend right every second

373
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,560
of every day was devoted to legal

374
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,759
procedures endless Warfare plagues Civil

375
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,320
Wars and famines he did not have freedom

376
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,959
now it seems that I'm being critical of

377
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,040
Marcus in this video but nothing could

378
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,560
be further from the truth the strain and

379
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,920
the stress that Marcus aurelus faced

380
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,000
would have broken any man and if you

381
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,120
look at the successors of Marcus you

382
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,880
have the proof communist was a lunatic

383
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,800
kacala was a sadist El gabis wanted a

384
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,360
sex change operation so the fact that

385
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Marcus could bear the burden of office

386
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,399
is an impressive impressive feed but

387
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,839
let's be clear Marcus Aurelius lived his

388
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,120
entire life on the defense he didn't

389
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,519
have a choice his health was poor and

390
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,399
his Empire was crumbling the main point

391
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,399
is you do have a choice you are not an

392
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,279
emperor of Rome you don't have to bear

393
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,959
the responsibilities of being an emperor

394
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,199
you don't have to worry about making

395
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,199
decisions that cost millions of lives

396
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,720
you don't have to live on the defensive

397
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,279
as Marcus did is my personal belief that

398
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,600
Marcus Aurelius had he had better health

399
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,600
would have not taken stoicism up and he

400
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,160
would have been less like senica and

401
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,759
more like Caesar he clearly had the

402
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,800
ability but he didn't have the mindset

403
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,399
and the reason he didn't have the

404
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,560
mindset is because he didn't have the

405
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,000
health that's why I keep telling you

406
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,680
health comes first and that includes

407
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,959
mental health you probably heard of

408
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,199
meditation before or even tried it maybe

409
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,120
you saw results and maybe you didn't I

410
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,199
have a unique meditation style that

411
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,680
nobody on YouTube has talked about this

412
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,440
is the esoteric meditation protocol one

413
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,120
of the principles of esoteric health is

414
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,959
that the body and the mind are one and

415
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,920
it is meaningless to train one without

416
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,959
the other based on this principle I've

417
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,600
created this protocol which I've been

418
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,279
using for years at this point the

419
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
standard meditation and advice of

420
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,720
sitting around focusing on breath takes

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
too long to see results and that's why

422
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,040
you quit cuz you don't see results quick

423
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,000
enough but I have fixed this problem I

424
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
will teach this meditation technique in

425
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,959
the next video so if you'd like to

426
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
subscribe you do have that option in

427
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,040
fact I have created a whole Community

428
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,920
called a 30-day brain reset it contains

429
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,880
a 30day long course a day byday training

430
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,519
to reset your brain this is the

431
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,600
technique that allowed me to gain

432
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,839
Traction in life for the first time it

433
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,920
allowed me to break through my

434
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,880
addictions helped me get better social

435
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,360
skills made me a better decision maker

436
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,560
and even gave me the skill at Sports and

437
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,000
exercise and boxing I a very strange

438
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,480
medit ation technique and you'll

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
understand what I mean when I actually

440
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,319
talk about it more if you like the idea

441
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,160
of being able to reset your brain for

442
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,600
less than 10 minutes per day then

443
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,519
there's a link in the description below

444
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,560
which is going to take you to that

445
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,720
Community right now it's practically

446
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,199
free so best time to get it is literally

447
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,399
today coming back to the history of

448
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,720
stoicism the word stoicism comes from

449
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,720
the word stoa which were these corridors

450
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,040
in Greece where philosophers will meet

451
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,720
and share ideas but where does the word

452
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,600
stoa comes from it comes from the Proto

453
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,839
indoeuropean root sta which means firm

454
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,319
but it is the same roote that gives us

455
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,959
the word stasis which means to never

456
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,799
change to stagnate and so we come to

457
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,760
another flaw with stoicism which nobody

458
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,000
really talks about the common wisdom is

459
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,199
that emotions are bad men should be not

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,919
emotional men should be rational and

461
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,600
logical and indeed stoic but does this

462
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,120
describe the greatest men of history

463
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Napoleon Alexander Ashoka Caesar shivaji

464
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,400
aurelian Justinian and even in more

465
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,559
times Washington Hamilton and even today

466
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,760
Elon Musk none of these men were

467
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,280
particularly stoic they were moved by

468
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,880
their Titanic emotional energy it was

469
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,360
the power of their emotions that allowed

470
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,360
them to lead their men in the first

471
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,600
place they acted on their emotions and

472
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,440
were driven by their emotions they made

473
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,760
terrible mistakes also because of the

474
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,880
emotions the very forces that made them

475
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,919
a great man also were in some cases

476
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,039
their downfall and here's where the

477
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,760
virtue of stoicism lies stoicism cannot

478
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,039
drive a man forward but it can stop a

479
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,159
man from slipping backwards sometimes

480
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,919
stasis is not a bad thing it matters

481
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,640
where you are if you're happy where you

482
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,880
are then stoicism is the perfect mindset

483
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,000
but for me I want to shake things up I

484
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,280
want to see what can drive a man

485
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,679
forwards and I think the best answer is

486
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,799
Faith just as stoicism is The Shield

487
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
that protects you faith is the sword

488
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,679
that strikes out this can be faith in

489
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,760
God but it can also be faith in one's

490
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,640
own ability it can be faith in the

491
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,280
possibility of a great future and this

492
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,280
is what I believe in
