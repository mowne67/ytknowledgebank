1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,080
when I asked you are you waiting for

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,200
life to start 70% said yes so you are

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,840
not alone I went to one of the best

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,360
engineering colleges in the United

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,160
States it has an awesome history during

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
the Industrial boom of America and even

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,640
during the second world war the United

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,960
States was an industrial giant it is a

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,320
machine of such size and power that not

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,119
even the proud German engineering could

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,119
withstand her output

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,920
my University produced some of the

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,320
finest engineering men of the century

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,520
literally like Neil Armstrong but when I

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,800
graduated I didn't feel like I was on

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,960
their level I didn't feel empowered to

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,199
make decisions I felt like I had to ask

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,079
for permission to do things I felt

19
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,520
untested I felt that there was something

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
I was missing I knew in my bones that I

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,800
had skipped some important and vital

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
step when you complete your degree you

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,039
get a paper but that does not transform

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,480
you into a man over the next few years I

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,640
had to join the Army build and fail at

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,040
business travel across the world

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,759
experience love and loss to eventually

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,240
have a sense of grounded maturity I have

29
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,759
a sense of self- knowledge now it took

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,439
me a decade of trial and error to figure

31
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,720
these things out I'm going to show you

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,759
how I'm going to show you how not to be

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,799
a child stuck in an adult's body the

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,600
grotesque thing about the modern age is

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,920
that there's no Frameworks to understand

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,560
when you achieve manhood what are the

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,880
exact steps you need to take the

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
transition from a child to an adult from

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,360
a boy to a man nobody knows least of all

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,799
your Boomer parents a lot of

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,680
self-improvement guys think that culture

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
has started to Decay because of Tik Tok

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,799
or porn but that's not true the decline

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,640
really started with the first world war

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,680
this terrible dis genic War cost mankind

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
some of its best men then of course the

47
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,200
second world war happened which made the

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
first one look like a rehearsal every

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,399
country fed its best men into the meat

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,399
grinder the best men died in

51
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,880
dishonorable battle mow down like grass

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,079
slaughtered like cattle in fact the best

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,520
men were the first to die as they queued

54
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,840
up to get enlisted it was in the fires

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
of that war that the world lost its

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,920
traditions and its religions it is from

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,519
this Unholy fire that the Modern Age of

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,680
the neoliberal order was born we've

59
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,879
destroyed our cultures so we default to

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,720
the image that social media feeds us

61
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,959
it's fairly obvious to you and me that

62
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,959
the social media image is fake it's a

63
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,239
bunch of Lies but it's not just because

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,560
the influencers themselves lie it's also

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,160
because the algorithms push the image of

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
a freakish super minority now this is

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
not another video about how social media

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,120
is bad I'm bored of such milk toast

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
opinions and my message is quite

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,840
different none of this is to say that

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
teenagers are silly or wrong to feel

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,680
behind on life in ancient cultures there

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,319
was a set point at which Boyhood ends

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,800
and manhood starts the Spartans famously

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
had the ritual of sending out their

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
agogi graduates into the wild with a

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,920
blanket and a spear only when they

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,239
returned if they returned would they be

79
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,799
initiated into the homoo as a

80
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,040
full-blooded spartiate the Messiah of

81
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,840
Kenya to this day need to kill a lion

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,879
with a spear to prove their Ascension to

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,760
full manhood only then do they get their

84
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,120
full adult name or lion name here's a

85
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,280
key idea that I need to explain with

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,000
more clarity many YouTubers will

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,159
emphasize this masculinity and danger

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,040
aspects of these rituals but they missed

89
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,959
the point these rituals aren't just

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
about bravery they're also a reflection

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,680
of the competence needed to excel in

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
their particular culture depending on

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,560
their specific threats the Spartans

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,920
needed to know how to survive in the

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,480
brutal conditions of their Homeland the

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,640
Messi needed to know how to gain Mastery

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,200
over the beasts of Africa it wasn't just

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
a matter of showing that you had balls

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,840
it was a matter of showing that you had

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,760
balls and also the brains not just to

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,079
survive but actually win here's a

102
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,120
different but highly similar example

103
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,799
Roman teenagers of patrician class would

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,480
be sent abroad on missions of State his

105
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,599
father we usually send him with a

106
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,400
trusted adviser or a slave this is

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,280
different from hunting lions or

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,799
surviving the hinterland of Sparta but

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
it made perfect sense for a young Roman

110
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,439
man it isn't just a matter of showing

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
bravery like I said it's a matter of

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,799
practical training it's a matter of

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,880
initiation not as a matter of tradition

114
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,199
but a matter of Education these

115
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,919
initiation rituals are a culmination

116
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,360
exercise a Capstone project at the end

117
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,479
of an educational series of steps if you

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
are a Roman Patrician you needed to know

119
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,639
how to would handle diplomacy and

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,560
politics you'd be tutored over years to

121
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,919
what that looked like and then be put to

122
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,000
the final test Spartan youth would have

123
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,800
done plenty of wilderness training under

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
supervision before they were sent out

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,160
alone the Messiah youth would have

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,639
hunted small prey Antelope and gazelle

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,199
before actually facing off against a

128
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,560
lion today this progression and this

129
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,840
initiation ritual is impossible because

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,080
we have no consensus and what competence

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,840
looks like or how to excel in society

132
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,639
since we have no initiation rituals

133
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,880
teenagers must find their own way to

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,320
demarcate the end of childhood and the

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
beginning of full adulthood without any

136
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,320
guidance they have to look towards what

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,440
activities adults can do but children

138
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,039
cannot do there's three categories of

139
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,039
this the first is the legally prohibited

140
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,160
activities like underage drinking or

141
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,680
drug use the second is biological

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,600
activity sex or if you don't have sex

143
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,639
then you have to settle for porn the

144
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,800
second is Adventure when you don't have

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,759
Adventure you settle for video games in

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
a video game you have initiation rituals

147
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,840
built in you have a tutorial that shows

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
you the ropes you have the boss fights

149
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,199
that test your expertise you have an

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,400
epic vision and a meaningful story you

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,840
need to travel long distances to explore

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,520
and do side quests to get rewards

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,440
sometimes it feels like video games are

154
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,560
more lifelike than real life and so the

155
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,039
modern initiation ritual is just a

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,759
selection of alcohol drugs casual sex

157
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,840
porn and video games this drive for a

158
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,120
teenager to prove their Worth to their

159
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,800
tribe is a force of primordial power the

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,400
ambition of Youth is the fire that

161
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,720
forges the steel girders of civilization

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,080
the wall that defends the tribe and the

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,240
spear that strikes out into the enemy it

164
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,160
is the Vitality of Youth that builds

165
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,000
Empires and indeed burns them down our

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Modern Age under the rule of Leviathan

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,280
conspired to smother that fire under

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,639
paranoia Neurosis addictions and anxiety

169
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,479
and on top of this you have the

170
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,000
pharmaceutical intervention in the form

171
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,080
of anti-depressants and the

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,560
psychological neutering in these school

173
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,560
systems nothing makes my blood boil the

174
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,120
way the modern society squanders its

175
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,840
youth the drive towards sex and intimacy

176
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,280
is turned towards dating apps and

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,440
pornography youth is for adventure

178
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,319
exploration and to experience love of

179
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,960
women for the first time is for

180
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,319
friendships is for daring decisions and

181
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,120
the honing of one's innate talents even

182
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,039
in olden times when travel was perilous

183
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,520
the aristocratic youth would be sent

184
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,520
overseas for mentorship Julius Caesar

185
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,199
was on such a trip when he got captured

186
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,599
by Pirates now this story boys is one

187
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,080
for the ages Caesar was about 20 or so

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
when he was on a small ship to the

189
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,720
island of rhs and while Caesar was on

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,039
this journey some corsac Pirates had the

191
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,199
great Misfortune of boarding and

192
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,360
capturing the small ship Caesar was

193
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,039
captured and held for ransom by these

194
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,319
Pirates and when he learned that the

195
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,919
Pirates were going to demand 20 talents

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,479
for his release he laughed and told them

197
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,120
that he was worth at least 50 imagine

198
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,080
the attitude of this man at such a young

199
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,240
age he was so sure of his worth that he

200
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,319
negotiated his Ransom up not down even

201
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,280
as a captive he would not act like a

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
prisoner he would play music he would

203
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,360
sing songs write poetry and basically he

204
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,840
treated the whole thing like a little

205
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,440
vacation he'd even practice speeches to

206
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,000
his pirates in fact that's why he was

207
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,720
going to roads in the first place he

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,120
wanted to be mentored by the finest

209
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,960
orators of the globe he knew the power

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,879
of speech he knew that that was more

211
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,800
powerful than any Shield or spear he was

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,680
utterly Carefree in captivity I want to

213
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,120
drive this point home because it is

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,800
important we moderns stress out and have

215
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,960
anxiety because our grades are low on an

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,440
exam or some chick said that she wasn't

217
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,800
interested this level of anxiety and

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,479
doubt is gay a captive man Caesar had

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,720
more life force than we do in the

220
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,720
comfort of our homes I think of how much

221
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,440
delusional Faith Caesar had in his

222
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,199
future and see if I can emulate even 1%

223
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,840
of his Aura but get this when Caesar was

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,680
eventually freed his story did not in

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,000
there he came back Caesar rallied troops

226
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,120
at that young age at the Port of militus

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,839
and went after the Pirates he found them

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
on the same island on which he was held

229
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,120
captive and he captured them in turn and

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,760
this is where the story turns red the

231
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,200
governor of Asia Minor actually wanted

232
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,880
to punish the Pirates but didn't want to

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,000
necessarily kill them but Caesar had

234
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,480
other plans he didn't just kill them he

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,519
crucified them Caesar was obviously no

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,240
ordinary man that's for sure I think the

237
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,000
older and wiser Caesar wouldn't have

238
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,240
done this I think he was young and

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,160
bloodthirsty in a different Universe if

240
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,880
Caesar hadn't gained political power in

241
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,399
Rome he would have joined the Pirates

242
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,279
and become the king of pirates Caesar as

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,920
the king of the Mediterranean now that

244
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,600
would be a fanfiction I'd be interested

245
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,959
in writing myself but here's the key

246
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Point even Caesar needed mentors he

247
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,320
looked up to Gus Marius his uncle and he

248
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,160
was mentored by crus and pompy ancient

249
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,440
societies had mentors that would help

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,920
craft the psyche of the Next Generation

251
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,600
to pass the T of Illumination when the

252
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,880
time is right what mentors have we in

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,279
this most banal of Ages which fat unread

254
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Boomer would be a mentor to us the Youth

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,959
of our age is withering away the youth

256
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,360
are the future of society and the future

257
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,200
looks anxious depressed neurotic

258
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,480
medicated and spiritually burnt out the

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,600
youth is wasted in video games porn

260
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,959
casual sex alcohol and also needless and

261
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
unnecessary schoolwork which I think is

262
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,440
the worst of all these some young men

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,240
will waste their time playing video

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
games and others will waste it studying

265
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,200
calculus because their idiots School

266
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,760
bored or their ignorant parents made

267
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
them it's all the same in the end at

268
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,440
least video games are fun but here's the

269
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,959
real kicker even in modern times we did

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
have rights of Passage we had mentorship

271
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,640
and we had initiation rituals just as

272
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,880
little as 20 years ago we had it all the

273
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Boy Scouts were this institution young

274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,839
boys would learned the basics of

275
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,800
survival skills appreciation of nature

276
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,079
through the identification of plant and

277
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,880
the identific ific ation of animal

278
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
tracks they'd have mentors who are

279
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,920
long-term outdoorsmen who teach these

280
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,120
skills and impart wisdom to the Young

281
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,480
Generation the Boy Scouts had a mission

282
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,920
they would serve nature and they would

283
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,760
serve Society they had uniforms they had

284
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,320
a clear competent progression through

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,959
the earning of badges this is the modern

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,320
equivalent of an initiation ritual but

287
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,120
they killed the scouts man this

288
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,560
particular act by the Leviathan boils my

289
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,600
blood more than most the infiltration

290
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,839
and the overturning of the scouts was a

291
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,040
devastating low to our society many

292
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,880
great men came from the Boy Scouts Neil

293
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,079
Armstrong actually came from the Scouts

294
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
in fact I was in the same fraternity as

295
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,360
Neil Armstrong was when he was in

296
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,760
college the story of The Fall of the Boy

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,120
Scouts is a sad story first they made

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,160
the Boy Scouts no longer Fun For Boys by

299
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,079
banning all the activities that young

300
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,440
boys actually enjoyed they banned water

301
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,360
gunfights they banned dodgeball banned

302
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,600
mechanical bulls all the fun stuff that

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,079
guys actually want to do when they're

304
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
young and then of course they became gay

305
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,639
there's no other way to say it they

306
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
allowed gay and transgender leaders and

307
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,160
volunteers naturally they lost the

308
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,399
support from parents and religious

309
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,399
organizations then of course the sexual

310
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,360
abuse scandals picked up attendance

311
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,680
dropped even more and then they let

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,079
girls in it's all political they knew

313
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,079
exactly what they're doing none of these

314
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,600
people wanted the Boy Scouts to succeed

315
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,920
they did it purposely to kill this

316
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,000
movement but what can we do first there

317
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,000
is hope smaller movements have already

318
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,240
been started by men who were Scouts in

319
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,440
their youth to provide their sons with

320
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,639
what their fathers had provided to them

321
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,519
so what if this huge organization lies

322
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,440
dying in fact it's because of their size

323
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,000
that they were targeted so much smaller

324
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,839
decentralized scouting movements could

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,279
actually be the future because it's more

326
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,519
anti- fragile to attack when we become

327
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,079
fathers it will be up to us to enroll

328
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,199
our sons in the future version of the

329
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,519
Boy Scouts and if one doesn't exist

330
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,800
we'll have to make it ourselves but of

331
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,800
course what about the steps that we can

332
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,680
take right now for our own personal

333
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,560
growth we never had any initiation

334
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,360
ritual so we have to make it ourselves

335
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,800
the key component in an initiation

336
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,199
ritual is not just proving to the tribe

337
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,279
that you are an adult but more

338
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,360
importantly it is to prove to yourself

339
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,639
that you're an adult most young guys

340
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,399
join the Army to prove that they have

341
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,199
what it takes but obviously this is not

342
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,800
a recommendation it may not be the best

343
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,639
choice for you you can start going to a

344
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,120
martial arts gym I don't care which kind

345
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
of martial arts it is the initiation

346
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,040
ritual for you might be to get into your

347
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
first ever real fight but I'll say that

348
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,639
there's certainly a real risk of injury

349
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
which I know too well there's a reason

350
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,839
why I had to step back from martial art

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,160
but martial arts and fighting is

352
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,440
certainly not the only option it depends

353
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,880
on your inner nature if you don't like

354
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
physical combat but love gardening why

355
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,839
not sign up for this organization called

356
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,880
wolf to connect you with an organic farm

357
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,519
where you get hands-on experience and

358
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,959
competence at farming hell if that seems

359
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,639
too challenging at least go camping most

360
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,440
guys haven't spent a single night under

361
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,199
the stars and they wonder why they're

362
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,959
depressed if you're interested in

363
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,000
Business and Entrepreneurship maybe you

364
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,440
should join a growth house a growth

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,880
house is basically when a group of guys

366
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
get together and create a high Tempo

367
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,279
environment to supercharge their growth

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,240
can you imagine the level of

369
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,560
accountability you'd have if you had a

373
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,199
