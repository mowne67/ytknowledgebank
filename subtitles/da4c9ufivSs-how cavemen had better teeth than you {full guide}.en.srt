1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,720
toothpaste is a scop to the toothbrush

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,680
is what does most of the cleaning you

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,559
actually don't need toothpaste and if

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,240
anything the toothpaste is actually

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,240
harming you and not helping you you see

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,360
toothpaste is highly abrasive it wears

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,480
down the enamel and that's what actually

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,400
causes cavities later down the line you

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,039
may have wondered what the caveman did

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,840
before the invention of toothpaste and

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,880
toothbrush and mouthwash and all these

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,359
things you might wonder what the animals

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,519
do how do they survive without brushing

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,560
their teeth well firstly even if you

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,879
look at the records it turns out that

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,960
the pre-agricultural human beings so the

17
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,320
people who were hunters and gatherers

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,399
their teeth and their bones was Far

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,239
stronger than anything we have as modern

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,399
humans and in fact it has been a steady

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,440
decline in bone and tooth quality since

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,960
then till now let's go back to

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,640
toothpaste real quick this one is sodine

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,399
it's in the name sodine right it's

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,320
supposed to help with sensitivity does

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,960
it so when I took out toothpaste from my

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,960
life and fully embraced the esoteric

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,920
Health movement I found that my teeth

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,479
were actually stronger and wider than

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
theyve ever been before the biggest scam

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
is charcoal toothpaste so charcoal

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,640
toothpaste is actually more abrasive

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,360
than your normal toothpaste you should

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,560
never be using charcoal toothpaste next

35
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,159
thing is the Stannis fluoride so there

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
was actually a toothpaste back in the

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,439
'90s called floristan pring gamble

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,000
announces Crest toothpaste with floran

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
one of the first toothpaste which had

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,600
well Stan is fluide so should you have

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
fluoridated tooth

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,960
it's exclusive fluoride compound world's

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
greatest weapon against Decay I already

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,520
made a video about fluoridation in our

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,920
water you can make your own decision as

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,320
to whether you want fluoride in your

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,680
toothpaste for me it's a definite no so

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
no fluoridated toothpastes for me there

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,799
do exist toothpaste nowadays which are

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
low abration and fluoride free if you

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
want to use those do go ahead I think

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,320
they're good products I personally have

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,200
chosen to use a tooth powder instead of

54
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,920
a toothpaste and I will link in the

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
description below to the tooth powder

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,600
which I use and and looking at the brush

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,719
you need to use Ultra Soft Ultra Soft

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,080
not just a soft Ultra Soft Ultra soft

59
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,720
brush and a low abrasion toothpaste or

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
ideally a low abrasion tooth powder you

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,000
should not be using the conventional

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,000
pepsodent cold gate all that BS

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,800
toothpaste all that's doing is probably

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
increasing the chances of cavity not

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
decreasing it so how often should you

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,800
brush your teeth the standard two times

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,720
a day is fine once in the morning once

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,360
at night but I always pair my

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,000
toothbrushing with oil pulling oil

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,760
pulling is a esoteric oral hygiene

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,959
method which you may have never heard of

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,680
before what you're doing is you're

73
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,879
taking olive oil or you can take coconut

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,720
oil is fine and you swirl it around in

75
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,599
your mouth and then spit it out after a

76
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,040
couple minutes so there's bacteria in

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,720
your mouth right when you're sleeping

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,000
bacteria are growing as you go about

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
your day you have food bacteria are

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,760
growing it's normal but bacterial cell

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,800
walls are made of lipids oil is made of

82
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,640
lipids so oil pulling is an ancient

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,760
technique which essentially it doesn't

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,360
necessarily break down cell walls but it

85
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,400
absorbs the bacteria and you spit it out

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,760
you get rid of a lot of the bacteria and

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,239
then did you know that Listerine

88
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,680
complete scop so Listerine was actually

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
a floor cleaner what they did is

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,879
completely marketing it's not anything

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
to do with signs they realized that they

92
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,799
weren't able to sell in a floor cleaner

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
right so they realized that they could

94
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,760
Rebrand and resell Listerine as a

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,400
mouthwash no tooth Bas can kill germs

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,560
the lerin does so they invented the term

97
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,159
h Tois which you might know as bad

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,439
breath they invented it look at this

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,480
they had TV commercials they had

100
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,239
newspaper commercials and they made this

101
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,760
thing a fear in people's mind but

102
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,439
something's gone wrong it was

103
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,760
psychological operation nothing wrong

104
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,720
with the Martin's marriage that lisine

105
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,360
couldn't fix it was a psychological

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,360
pressure in people's mind they made it

107
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,720
seem as though everybody you have bad

108
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,040
breath and that's why people don't like

109
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,560
you you have bad breath that's why your

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,959
social interaction suck you have bad

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,439
bread that's why you're not attracted to

112
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,120
women you have bad bread that's why

113
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,079
you're not attracted to men and they

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,120
used you're in security to push a floor

115
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,640
cleaner as a tooth and oral hygiene

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
product don't use Listerine it's garbage

117
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,000
and then look at the ingredients list in

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,120
line well or any Big Brand mouthwash

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,079
it's trash for one thing it has many

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,560
different kinds of different alcohols

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,880
what these do is they dry out the mouth

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
and decrease saliva production if you

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
know anything about how the mouth

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,440
microbiome works you know that you don't

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
want alcohol in your mouth cuz it kills

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,919
off the good bacteria in your mouth

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
that's one thing but the other thing is

128
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,639
the alcohol actually dries out your

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
mouth and decreases saliva production so

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
saliva contains Calcium and phosphates

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,039
you need those to rebuild your teeth you

132
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
need those for healthy enamels but the

133
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,120
lisin actually counterproductive right

134
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
it actually the more lisin you use the

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,479
more you feel like using it cuz you use

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,440
lisine your mouth becomes dry you think

137
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
you need to use lisine again in order to

138
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,000
fix that so it's a amazing thing for the

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,840
company which makes the stuff but it's

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
terrible for you another thing you need

141
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,720
is a tongue scraper this one is a

142
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,400
plastic one there are bamboo ones and

143
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,880
like other ones wooden ones I would

144
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,720
probably suggest those this is the one

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
which I had so tongue scrapping is very

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,199
important you need to do this once a day

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
ideally twice a day is very simple just

148
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
after you brush your teeth take the

149
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,479
tongue tongue scraper and then just pull

150
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,800
it across your tongue very gently cuz

151
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,639
you don't want to damage your tongue and

152
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,199
then just you know wash your mouth and

153
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,840
clean the tongue scraper and everything

154
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
and a lot of bacteria a lot of odor

155
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,560
comes actually from the tongue not the

156
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,600
teeth themselves so if you're neglecting

157
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
your tongue scrapping that's probably a

158
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,680
lot of where your mouth odor issues come

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
from then of course we we have flossing

160
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,120
this important this is non-negotiable

161
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
get yourself a bunch of uh these

162
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,520
toothpicks or you know floss picks I

163
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,639
guess you can call them and try to get

164
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,360
the ones with narrower strings and just

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,520
put them between your teeth and make him

166
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,400
go all the way to the gums clean out

167
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,680
every single day at least once at night

168
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,160
you don't need to do in the morning but

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,680
at night you should be doing it no

170
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,199
excuses so the reason why they added

171
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,919
fluoride in the water at least the

172
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,720
official reason why they added added

173
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,240
fluoride in the water is to help your

174
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
teeth so what's going on here what's the

175
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,000
scientific mechanism behind this so what

176
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
happens is as as sugars wear away in the

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,240
teeth so I mean fluoride is a scam from

178
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,520
the start right because they added high

179
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,120
fructose corn syrup to everybody's diet

180
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,840
which caused the tooth decay in the

181
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,360
first place and to fix this they added

182
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,840
fluoride into the water they should have

183
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,840
addressed the corn syrup issue but they

184
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,880
never did that so the sugars wear away

185
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,720
the tooth enamel and fluoride is

186
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,800
essentially there to replace lost enamel

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
but fluoride is not the actual chemical

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,039
which is supposed to be in our teeth yes

189
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
fluoride is more resistant to corrosion

190
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,840
but the teeth are supposed to be made of

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
calcium and you can get calcium from a

192
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,639
variety of sources the best way to get

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,919
calcium a good amount of calcium highly

194
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,120
bioavailable calcium is not through

195
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
freaking supplements supplement industry

196
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,759
is a scam I mean not every single

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,800
supplement is bad right but most

198
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
supplements are not bioavailable to

199
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,240
human being so most supplements are just

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
a waste of your money and if anything

201
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,800
it's more risk than they word and it

202
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,319
comes to calcium eggshells boy so I know

203
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,520
you saw I know the the hook of this

204
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,360
video was the eggshell right I was

205
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,319
eating the egg whole like with the

206
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,479
eggshell that's legit legit look it up

207
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,039
right now eating the eggshell is

208
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,440
actually very beneficial best source of

209
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,479
calcium for your body it's been done for

210
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,400
thousands of years like it's not new

211
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,400
it's ancient wisdom and that's what the

212
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
esoteric Health movement is about is

213
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,120
unearthing ancient wisdom combining it

214
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,319
with modern science and delivering it to

215
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,599
you in an easy to understand format then

216
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,560
there's some stuff which can stain your

217
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,240
teeth you have coffee tea wine they'll

218
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,680
stain your teeth they won't necessarily

219
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,000
damage your teeth but obviously you

220
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,800
don't want your teeth to look yellow and

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,680
gross right so what you do is after you

222
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,120
drink wine coffee or tea or anything

223
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,479
like that or any sticky sweet substances

224
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,560
you need to address the issue

225
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,919
immediately you need to go to the

226
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,879
bathroom wash your mouth at the minimum

227
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,080
ideally brush your teeth with just a

228
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,360
brush you don't need toothpaste like I

229
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,479
said before or you can do oil pulling

230
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,879
you need to do one of these things like

231
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,720
you at least need to address it you need

232
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,720
to at least wash with water so I brought

233
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
up before how did the cavemen and

234
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,560
animals how do they survive without

235
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
having their teeth rotting at age 15

236
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,800
right so one thing is saliva again

237
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,440
cheese milk meat dairy product products

238
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,400
all the esoteric food substances you

239
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,280
know even vegetables vegetables which

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,039
have fiber especially they all stimulate

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,599
saliva production and saliva essentially

242
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,440
remineralizes and reforms your teeth

243
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,479
stronger so this is again a diet issue

244
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,879
if you have a bad diet if you're

245
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,199
drinking soda having candy all that

246
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,199
garbage then you're not going to have

247
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
good teeth surprise surprise right so

248
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,599
fix your diet use the methods which I

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,360
told you and you'll have much better

250
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,720
oral hygiene I guarantee you I swear to

251
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,280
God I hope you're not using like five

252
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,879
gum or any of those stupid bubble gums

253
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,159
and chewing gums instead here's what you

254
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,039
should use the most effective which I

255
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,320
found is cloves so I don't know if you

256
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,959
know what cloves are cloves are these

257
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,320
little spices they look like little they

258
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,240
look like little torches

259
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,000
almost so cloves just put them in your

260
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,000
mouth and swirl them around chew them

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,920
because they have these little barbs

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,680
almost they get into your gums and

263
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
behind your teeth Etc and they clean it

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,640
out if you have a clo in your mouth and

265
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,079
the other example or other option is

266
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,560
mastic gum Mastic gum is not the same

267
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,240
thing as your modern industrialized

268
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,360
chewing gums mastic gum is actually

269
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,600
legit it's it's a sap which grows from

270
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
an actual tree so it's completely

271
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,720
organic so Mastic Gum also stimulates

272
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,120
saliva production it's another way you

273
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,399
can use to remineralize your teeth and

274
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
fight against bacteria fight against bad

275
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,959
