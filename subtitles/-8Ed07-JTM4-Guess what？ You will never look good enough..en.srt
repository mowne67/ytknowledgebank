1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
I've learned something new. I've

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,920
investigated and learned about what's

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,600
called the mouse utopia experiments. And

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,679
what I've learned there has changed my

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,559
perspective on society forever. And not

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
in a good way. So I caution you. If you

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,240
don't want to learn about what's coming,

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,760
turn back now. The mouse utopia

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,000
experiments were conducted in the 50s

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
and 70s when the population of the world

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
was booming. They wanted to know what

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
happens when society reaches a certain

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
limit. What they did was they took nine

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,119
mice and put them in a huge enclosure.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,680
This enclosure was the ideal environment

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,120
for a mouse. They had habitats. They had

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,520
the perfect temperature. They had

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,520
infinite food. They had no diseases.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,440
Essentially, they wanted to study how

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
the population would explode and what

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
would happen next. Here's the most

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,559
curious part about this experiment. The

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
capacity of this enclosure was 6,000

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,039
mice. In other words, 6,000 mice could

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,719
live here comfortably. The population,

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,199
as you might expect, started to increase

27
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,760
every 55 days. the population doubled.

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,479
So that nine mouse that population just

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,799
rapidly rapidly increased. How far do

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,479
you think it would get to 6,000? You

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,520
think it would get to 6,000 and then

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,880
decline or do you think it would exceed

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,680
6,000? In your mind, think of what that

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,080
number would be? The answer is they

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,520
never made it that far. They made it to

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,080
2,000. An enclosure of capacity 6,000

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,240
and they made it only 2,000. And as soon

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400
as they hit the 2,000 mark, their

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,799
population started to decline. And it

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
didn't stop declining. It declined all

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
the way to extinction. There were no

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,600
mice left. So nine mice started in an

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,600
enclosure which can capacitate

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,040
6,000. They made it to 2,000 and then

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,759
they went to zero. This is not good. But

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
what caused this behavior change? And

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
there's a name for this. There's a

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
scientific name for this called

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,119
behavioral sync. Mice have behaviors as

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,040
all mammals do. The nature of their

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
behaviors changed as the population

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,920
increased and they had more resources

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
than they knew what to do with.

54
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,240
Specifically, male mice changed their

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
behaviors to be more like female mice.

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Their hormonal states even changed to be

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
more like that of female mice. Same

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
time, the female mice started acting

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
more aggressively like the male mice

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,720
would have. Their hormone systems also

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
changed. As the population increased and

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,200
the mice realized there was no dangers,

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
there was no room for struggle. There

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
was no reason to be afraid. An

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
interesting phenomenon arose. An

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,319
interesting type of male mouse was born.

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
This was called the beautiful one. These

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,160
were young males who should be at the

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
peak of life. They should be healthy,

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
vigorous, and they should be seeking out

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,239
mates. But this is not what happened.

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,000
They would instead isolate themselves

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,239
and focus on one thing which was to look

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
better. They' focus on grooming. In

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
other words, these mice would spend all

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
day preing themsel, looking better,

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
looking nicer, being more fit, being

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
more attractive. But for what end? They

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
were not interested in women. Just the

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
beautifification of the self. Pure

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,519
narcissism. So what does this remind you

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
of? Is this not at least a little bit

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879
similar to the looks maxing movement?

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,239
Now you might think well looks maxing is

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,879
different because it's obviously focused

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,360
on girls and that is in fact where it

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
started. It was all about game pickup

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,800
and looks maxing. These three were the

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,720
holy trinity of the young man back in

90
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,080
2012. But things have changed. The other

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,640
two parts of this become less important

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,000
and the focus has shifted towards pure

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
looks. The black pill has emerged

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,040
ascendant. The black pill states that in

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
the end of the day game doesn't matter.

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,440
The end of the day behavior doesn't

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,760
matter. Just the looks matter. This

98
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,879
phenomenon started with the basics. Go

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,239
to the gym, have good hair, have a good

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,000
fashion sense, smell nice, be

101
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,720
attractive. But soon it morphed. The

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,319
first step in this morph was meuing. The

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
idea that you can actually change your

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,080
facial structure through behavior

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
patterns. Cool. I'm not against muing,

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
by the way. I'm just saying this was the

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
next step. Mewing became a phenomenon,

108
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
took off, became a trend to the point at

109
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
which even absolutely normal people

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,720
living their life know what meing is

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,560
which bizarre. Few years ago, like even

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
5 years ago, nobody knew what that was.

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
But now everybody knows what it is. But

114
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,000
my prediction is as time goes, 10 years,

115
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,079
bone smashing and these more arcane and

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
weird types of looks maxing will

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,560
actually become the standard and things

118
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,479
like mewing will become milk toast

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,800
things which everybody's assumed to do.

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,600
There's there's height maxing. The idea

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,000
of actually having surgeons cut your

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
femurss and insert metal rods to

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,120
increase your height by a couple inches.

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,360
Insane. Especially because yes, you gain

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
the couple inches of height, but in so

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
doing, you become less athletically

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
capable. You can't lift anymore. So,

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,919
think about this. So, there are guys out

129
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,000
there who are sacrificing actual

130
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,800
performance for appearance. Disgusting

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
behavior. All this is pure theaters. all

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
just pure performance in front of a

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
camera. It has nothing to do with human

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,400
beings. It has nothing to do with actual

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
human female. And in so far as it does,

136
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,759
it's just pure shallow sex derived from

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
social media apps or rather I should say

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,240
um the dating apps. And the phenomenon

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
of course I think comes from the dating

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
apps. On dating apps, there is no game.

141
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,919
There's only copyrightiting in the

142
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,400
description and the actual pictures. So

143
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759
what do guys do? They just optimize the

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
pictures. That's the only thing they

145
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,560
care about. How do pictures work?

146
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Pictures work through the eyesight, the

147
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,400
gaze. What's happening is these men are

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,520
enraptured. They are cornered and

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,919
trapped and ens snared by the female

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
gaze. This is men who are turned to

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,240
stone by women in the same way that

152
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,479
Medusa turns men to stone using her

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,880
gaze. Is this not the same as the

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,479
beautiful ones in the mice study? These

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
are mice who didn't care about women

156
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,039
anymore, at least female mice anymore,

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
but they instead cared solely about the

158
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,039
grooming and becoming pretty. Now, you

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,280
might think, well, there's a mouse

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,960
experiment doesn't apply to humans. Mice

161
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,720
dumb, humans smart. Well, has it not

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
already happened? Look at the Roman

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,919
Empire. After the Chads of Rome built

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,639
the city, I think it was Augustus who

165
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,199
said, "I saw Rome to be a city of brick

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
and I made it a city of marble." After

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
those days were passed, what did the

168
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:28,199
emperors of Rome look like? They were

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,199
twinks, illegabilous, literal

170
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,680
It was so funny.

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Oh no. Emperor after emperor of Rome was

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,880
either a twink or mentally ill and they

173
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
brought an entire empire to its knees.

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,560
So big picture, what are we looking at?

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,160
We have these interesting phenomenon

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
just emerging. things like the height

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
maxing and bone smashing which I think

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,120
are precursors to the end. These come

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,039
about from the extreme information

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
overload as well as the stimulation

181
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
overload. I think it was Nietze who

182
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,720
would just refuse to read books at all

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
because he didn't want his brain to be

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
polluted by other people's thoughts. But

185
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
for us nowadays, we are polluted by the

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
thoughts of so many people all the way

187
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,000
from government agencies and the news

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
also to individuals in social media. I

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
think step one is to reduce your content

190
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
consumption. I want you to choose three

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
things that you want to improve on.

192

Maybe it's wealth, health, and

193
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,360
relationships. And choose one influencer

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,840
for each who you actually trust and just

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
follow their stuff. You don't need a

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
hell lot of perspectives. You need to

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
first trust your own self. Even more

198
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,919
important than finding influencers you

199
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,240
trust is actually self-experimentation.

200
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,479
