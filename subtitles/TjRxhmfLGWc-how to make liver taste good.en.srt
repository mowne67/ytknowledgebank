00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,039
actually going to be nutritious and

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,260
healthy I'm not going to eat this raw

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,600
because that's recorded and here we have

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,640
turkey liver you can use chicken liver

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,859
you can use beef liver you can use bison

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
liver liver of all kinds is highly

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,820
highly nutritious it's one of the best

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,440
superfoods like you know how the

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,899
magazines and all these people will be

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,719
like kale kale is a superfood or quinoa

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,239
is a superfood no BS liver is actually

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,160
the king and all kinds of liver chicken

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,020
turkey beef whatever it is that you're

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
planning to use all of them are really

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,340
really good I happen to be using turkey

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,440
liver today but you can use anything and

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,899
the recipe will work out just fine so

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,719
what you need is the liver the mushrooms

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,699
potatoes and garlic not onion I think I

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,620
call this an onion before so first step

28
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,899
is is unless you're getting your produce

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,540
from a farmer's market you know for a

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,000
fact that all your produce is covered in

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,500
herbicides pesticides insecticides all

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,020
the sides which you don't want in your

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
body so everything which you eat whether

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,159
it be potatoes or mushrooms you need to

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,799
wash them not just with water but also

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,900
with baking soda and vinegar so we have

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,520
our potatoes we have mushrooms I'm going

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,860
to put the whole thing in so what do we

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,680
have one two three four five six seven

40
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,979
eight something like 15 mushrooms and

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,420
I'm using one two three four potatoes

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,820
and this is 2.2 pounds of the liver and

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,380
regarding washing vegetables it's not as

44
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,659
important for like potatoes but it's

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,280
very very very important for fruits and

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,439
berries more so than these ones because

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,880
fruits and berries especially berries

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,619
because they have such high moisture

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,079
content they tend to go bad easily and

50
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,119
so they have to add these fungicides to

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,040
protecting them from fungus and these

52
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,439
fungicides are very very toxic for

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,780
anybody who eats them so you add water

54
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,840
you mix it up and you let it soaked for

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,200
a little bit and as this soaks we can go

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
ahead and peel the garlic as trust in

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,500
the modern diet and Modern Health

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,120
practices declines there's going to be

59
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,160
more creators like me who want to show

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,840
you how to prepare healthy meals in the

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,599
traditional way but it's also going to

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,700
be a lot of scammers like liver King who

63
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,319
take steroids and abuse their body to

64
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,660
have a certain look and claim that

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,520
that's Primal right you have to use your

66
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,620
own judgment your own discernment to

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
find out who's actually natural and

68
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,520
who's not because whenever there's a

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,560
movement and I I really think that the

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,840
esoteric Health movement is going to

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,459
crash upon the mainstream in a big way

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,260
in the next five to ten years A lot of

73
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,180
people are going to be turning towards

74
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,239
traditional Health practices like eating

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,879
organ Meats like getting sunlight

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,980
refusing to eat seed oils and so on and

77
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,540
as this cultural shift happens there's

78
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,040
going to be money to be made that's just

79
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,319
the case right and people are going to

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,940
be making money in all the wrong ways

81
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,519
liver King is just a start there's going

82
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,319
to be more scammers I guarantee so keep

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,959
your eyes without know who's real who's

84
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,940
not and you know make your judgment

85
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,680
based on your instincts make your

86
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,480
judgment based on your knowledge and

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,099
make your judgment based on your eyes if

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,140
the guy doesn't look natural he's

89
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,360
probably not natural the prevalence of

90
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,159
performance enhancing drugs is just as

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,780
prevalent in the influencer industry as

92
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,620
it is in the sports industry and there

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,940
we have it we have our garlic nicely

94
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,640
peeled

95
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,760
and here we have a crock pot crock pot

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,340
is the ultimate cooking tool it makes

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,560
every food so easy to cook just drop

98
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,580
your garlic right into it you don't need

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,860
to slice them you don't need to do

100
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,799
anything just put them in there and then

101
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,000
we have to go ahead and cut the potatoes

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
into smaller chunks

103
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,239
and finally we have the liver you don't

104
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,799
need to cut it you don't have to do

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,400
anything in fact you don't even have to

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,280
drain the blood just add the entire

107
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,420
liver all of them now if you have

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
something bigger like if you have beef

109
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,780
liver or you have bison liver or

110
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,519
something then you have to cut it but

111
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,080
turkey livers are not that big so I can

112
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,120
put them directly and same for chicken

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,459
liver so you don't have to cut them and

114
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,000
then once you have everything in place

115
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,260
now it's time to add all the seasoning

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,239
and everything else that you need to

117
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,040
actually make this taste good first we

118
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,979
have olive oil and I'm using of course

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,320
extra virgin olive oil just

120
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:27,060
I'm not measuring exactly how much just

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,560
a nice generous Splash then we have salt

122
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,639
I'm using pink salt but it doesn't

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,900
really matter you can use any kind of

124
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,340
salt I'm doing one

125
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,979
big tablespoon

126
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,540
of salt in fact I'll actually go ahead

127
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,580
and increase it to one and a half

128
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,560
tablespoons of salt I could have even

129
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,780
put two because salt is not the enemy

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,220
they made you think that salt is very

131
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,080
bad for you it's going to give you like

132
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,460
heart attack and whatnot that's not true

133
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,040
salt is actually pretty useful pretty

134
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,380
good for your body then we have well

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,000
more importantly we have pepper so you

136
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,120
need you definitely need pepper in this

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,580
and this is just freshly ground

138
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,560
pepper and I'm just going to sprinkle

139
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,900
some of that how much is that probably

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,280
one tablespoon but again I'm not

141
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,460
measuring it perfectly because I don't

142
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,199
need to and then we have turmeric also

143
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,100
called haldi this you don't need that

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,060
much of probably like half a tablespoon

145
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:24,240
of haldi then we have red cayenne pepper

146
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,759
and this is just a Sprinkle not more

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,600
than that just for a little bit of spice

148
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,160
and then we have garlic powder you can

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
be more generous with the garlic powder

150
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,180
I like the taste if you don't like it

151
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,460
then don't put it obviously then we have

152
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,500
ginger powder also very important put a

153
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,560
bunch of ginger powder in this and

154
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,400
finally we have some oregano I'm gonna

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,460
sprinkle oregano on this thing

156
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,500
and before I forget you're going to use

157
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,600
chicken broth or any kind of bone broth

158
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,460
really because that's going to be the

159
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,660
base for cooking rather than water just

160
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,160
makes everything taste better it's more

161
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,520
nutritious as well

162
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,360
add a nice there's probably one cup

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,740
probably one cup of the chicken broth

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,419
and there we have it we have all the

165
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,639
ingredients in this already but we need

166
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,100
to mix it up and then turn it on so I'll

167
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,800
just use my hands mix all the

168
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,840
ingredients and that's it liver takes

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
much less time to cook than chicken meat

170
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,060
like the actual muscle meat so for

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,180
chicken you would usually put the crock

172
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,039
pot on low for eight hours or on high

173
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,199
for four hours for the liver we're going

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,020
to cut that time in half so I'm going to

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,300
turn it on high and remove it from the

176
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,979
heat in about two hours all right so

177
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,259
it's been two hours two and a half hours

178
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,720
actually since when I got this started

179
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm gonna open it up

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,819
and

181
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,620
see if the potatoes are done why because

182
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,539
if the potatoes are done then everything

183
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,300
else is done that's the way this this

184
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,039
works so if you look at that the

185
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,199
potatoes are nice and fluffy they're

186
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,660
coming apart which means they're good of

187
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,819
course I can taste some

188
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,139
I mean it's super hot right now so I'll

189
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,120
just take a little bit

190
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,560
and

191
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,900
yeah

192
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,880
tastes fun tastes like it's done

193
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,520
which means everything else is done so

194
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,680
this is so okay so look at that the

195
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,840
liver is kind of coming apart I don't

196
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
want to break the livers I think I I

197
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,740
prefer eating them without breaking them

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,780
so if you have like chicken breast or

199
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,060
any kind of muscle meat it'll get

200
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,220
shredded and that's fine but for the

201
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,979
livers I like to keep them intact of

202
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,919
course get the get the mushrooms get the

203
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,580
potatoes get some of this extremely

204
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,340
nutritious extremely nutritious

205
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,220
um like broth going on with the stew

206
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,500
broth that has a whole bunch of

207
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,660
nutrients your body will thank you for

208
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,580
look at that see liver doesn't have to

209
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,560
taste nasty you know and you don't have

210
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,500
to eat the liver raw despite what

211
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,360
freaking liver King says this is well

212
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,199
cooked beautiful

213
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,120
tasting liver and and get some of this

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,160
garlic as well you see that garlic clove

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,319
right there so

216
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,380
just look at it let's look at it in the

217
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,720
light that's a really nice and tasty

218
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,539
meal the kind of the blandness of the

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,660
potato contrasts nicely with the rich

220
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:22,259
flavor of the liver

221
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,000
and we have an excellent easy to cook

222
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,520
meal I'm going to go ahead and turn this

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,099
thing off and then we'll taste test this

224
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,500
so the question is how does it taste so

225
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,399
have the liver and first I'm going to

226
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,300
try

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,300
the garlic

228
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,560
really good the Garlic's gonna absorb

229
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,419
the flavor of the meat the potatoes

230
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,800
not so much the potatoes are still a

231
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,779
little bit Bland which is which is fine

232
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,339
because it contrasts nicely in the

233
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,220
mushrooms because yeah the mushrooms are

234
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,740
also a very meaty kind of flavor so it

235
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,300
adds to the meat and kind of wholesome

236
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,300
and fulfilling nature of this dish

237
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,720
the mushrooms actually really excellent

238
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
the mushrooms might be the highlight of

239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,720
this dish to be honest mushrooms are

240
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,980
high in a lot of micronutrients your

241
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,180
body needs for your testosterone

242
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,680
production and if you're a woman

243
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,220
obviously it's for your hormonal Health

244
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,700
as well and then the liver itself the

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,760
king liver is in fact King let's taste

246
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,760
it

247
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,279
perfect perfect you know liver is done

248
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,959
correctly when it's not too tough when

249
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,000
you cook liver for too long what happens

250
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,580
it becomes tough and kind of gross

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,860
tasting it kind of becomes almost like a

252
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,019
sandpaper like dry texture if you if you

253
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,060
cook it for too long this is perfectly

254
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,860
done so it actually tastes a little bit

255
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,660
moist it tastes really good has flavor

256
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,220
to it it's very different from muscle

257
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,080
meat that's for sure but it doesn't

258
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,459
taste bad a lot of people think the

259
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,140
liver tastes gross that's not the case

260
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,180
you make it right and it'll taste right

261
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,839
all right I gotta go and enjoy my meal
