1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
acrylamide is formed when you microwave

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,359
your food and if it sounds toxic that's

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
because it is you have to understand

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,759
that the human body is not just a

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
biochemical machine it's also an

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,320
electrochemical Masterpiece most people

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,920
don't know this but the signals from our

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,600
brain is not transmitted to the rest of

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199
our body through electrical pulses like

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,920
in a wire but rather through a system of

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,760
ion channels and electron pumps and

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,560
these store up energy in the form of

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
concentration gradients and they

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,320
basically use that to transmit a pulse

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
through a series of long cell called

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,840
neurons and all this relies on ions like

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,320
calcium sodium and potassium and that

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,000
brings us to our video sponsor element

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,079
now I'm kidding with you man but

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,079
the thing is these ions these charged

21
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,760
particles are influenced by

22
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,960
electromagnetic radiation I talked

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,079
earlier about the formation of

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,600
acrylamide in our food when you heat it

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,480
in the microwave but even before that

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,239
let's talk about improper shielding so

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,239
if you ever listened to music on your

28
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,280
Bluetooth headphones while you're using

29
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,359
a microwave oven you might have noticed

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
that there's interference or even

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,320
disconnection

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,199
from your device this is proof that the

33
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,799
radiation is not shielded properly that

34
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,880
is to say electromagnetic radiation is

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,320
leaking from your microen and we can of

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,159
assume that there's no problem here

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,040
there's no Health effect but what if

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
there is but talking about the food

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,119
again so let's talk about another

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,759
observation you probably notice that

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,720
when you heat food a microwave like some

42
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,840
parts of it are ice cold when other

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,920
parts are super heated this is the

44
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,000
problem which causes the formation of

45
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,520
these toxins so because some parts of

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,920
the food are heated to an extreme degree

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,280
there's chemical reactions which start

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
which cause the creation of acrylamide

49
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,560
and other toxins so when it comes to the

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,520
issue of the electromagnetic shielding

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
the solution is pretty clear just step

52
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,439
away from your microwave when you're

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,159
using it simply stepping away from the

54
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,680
microwave is going to drastically reduce

55
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,680
the electromagnetic radiation that you

56
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,360
actually incur and if you're like four

57
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,320
five steps away from your microwave

58
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,719
that's far enough but the acrylamide

59
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,560
issue is a little bit more complex it

60
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,880
depends on what food it is how long

61
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,840
you've been heating it for and how you

62
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,880
actually heat it so first thing Heating

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,960
liquids is mostly fine heating water

64
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,479
milk coffee I have no issue with that

65
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,079
and the reason behind that is because in

66
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,959
liquids the particles are free to move

67
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,800
so as you're heating them in a microwave

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,560
there's convection currents which form

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
which kind of move around the water move

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
around the liquid and no part of the

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,280
liquid gets super heated and so there's

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
no formation of toxins but now when it

73
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,200
comes to food especially carbohydrate

74
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,319
rich foods so what's going on is this

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,680
extra heat this excess heat causes a

76
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,480
reaction called the mord reaction and to

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,879
be fair mord reactions are very common

78
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,319
in cooking and I'm not at all saying

79
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,440
that this reaction is always to be

80
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,480
avoided searing a steak or caramelizing

81
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,040
the top of a Creme Brule that's all a

82
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,840
form of mad reaction so basically when

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,879
carbohydrates and amino acids are

84
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,599
subjected to extreme heat you have the

85
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,720
potential to create acrylamides so don't

86
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,959
heat carbohydrates in the microwave for

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,840
too long and before I even get into that

88
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,920
heating the microwave is not by any

89
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,879
means the only cooking process or only

90
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,360
heating process which causes the

91
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,120
creation of toxin

92
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,239
far far worse is deep frying in seed

93
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
oils so if you have french fries and you

94
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,000
deep fry them in seed oils that's far

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,840
more contaminated the toxins than taking

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,239
a potato and baking it in the microwave

97
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,480
oven so if you were to make fries by

98
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,879
frying it in Tallow that's fine but if

99
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,879
you fry it in seed oils it is not fine

100
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,920
and the reason comes down to the

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
stability of the fats saturated fats

102
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,280
like Tallow are extremely stable they

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,200
can withstand quite a bit of oxidative

104
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,200
stress seed oils on the other hand are

105
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,319
unstable they have double bonds these

106
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,959
bonds can break down through oxidative

107
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,200
stress and this causes the oils to

108
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,640
become toxic and I have a whole video on

109
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,360
seed oils already created so if you want

110
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,879
to watch that for more information

111
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,920
please do so I'll link to it in the

112
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,400
description or even have the card pop up

113
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
as an end screen at the end of this

114
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,360
video the story of seed oils is a

115
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,239
disgusting story of corporate greed and

116
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
government subsidy I'm simply not okay

117
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,360
with putting industrial lubricant into

118
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,439
my body despite what government

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
organizations and the American Heart

120
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,319
Association which is a scam organization

121
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,439
have to say about the topic now coming

122
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,720
back to to microwaves so don't store

123
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,519
anything on top of the microwave because

124
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,599
it will be affected by the radiation so

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
I went to my mom's house a month ago and

126
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,799
she had Vitamin D supplements on top of

127
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
the microwave and I just picked it up as

128
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,560
the microwave was running I was just

129
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,919
heating some coffee or something and I

130
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,799
felt that it was warm like really warm I

131
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,320
realized that this vitamin D supplement

132
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,199
was essentially going through hundreds

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,800
of cycles of heating and cooling every

134
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,320
time this microwave was switched on so

135
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Vitamin D supplements are kind of BS

136
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,600
anyway the soft gel tablets that it come

137
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,240
in it's filled with seed oils and the

138
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
fact that my mom had placed it on top of

139
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,120
the microwave and subject it to

140
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,840
countless cycles of heating and cooling

141
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
made that toxic so I tossed it out

142
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,720
immediately and speaking of Vitamin D

143
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,440
supplements all I have to say about that

144
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,240
topic is if you need Vitamin D

145
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,840
supplements for example if you are in a

146
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,039
cold region and you don't get a lot of

147
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,919
sunlight during the winter months

148
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,840
especially if you're dark skinned like I

149
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,960
am then it does actually make sense to

150
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,440
have a supplement for vitamin D but not

151
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,039
the actual store-bought capsules instead

152
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,400
go for cod liver oil from a company that

153
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,840
actually gets their sourcing from

154
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,479
non-toxic fish the one which I use is

155
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,160
called Green pasture I've recommended it

156
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,800
before so I personally have been cutting

157
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
down drastically on my use of the

158
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,720
microwave oven I've instead started

159
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
using the convection oven so what you do

160
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,199
is just take your food put it on your

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,840
ceramic plate set the convection oven

162
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,919
for 375° f let the thing preheat and

163
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,039
then you put your food in for about 10

164
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,479
to 12 minutes you can absolutely put

165
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
multiple plates of food in there if

166
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,800
you're eating with your friends or

167
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
family so what if you have no option but

168
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,160
to use a microwave oven for example if

169
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
you pack your home food food and you

170
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,560
take it to work and you handly have the

171
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
option of a microwave oven what do you

172
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,240
do so here's some tips I can give you

173
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
first make sure that you aren't leaving

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
the food in there for more than 1 minute

175
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,520
so you can put the food in there for 1

176
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,319
minute and then take it out Stir It flip

177
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,960
it move it whatever it is and then put

178
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,440
it back for a second minute so that the

179
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,240
heating is more even and it doesn't

180
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
cause the creation of these toxins and

181
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,400
second obviously I'm not going to insult

182
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,440
your intelligence you already know not

183
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
to use Plastics in the microwave oven so

184
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,960
let's just leave it at that and here's

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,039
another thing so on this channel I've

186
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,600
always taken the science of things but

187
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,000
I've also always looked at the context

188
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,639
the history of stuff so when you look at

189
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,400
the microwave and you realize that the

190
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,720
biggest impact it had is not the

191
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,840
toxicity it's actually the social impact

192
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
it had an impact on the family structure

193
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,960
the family tradition so when I was a kid

194
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,080
there was no option of a microwave oven

195
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,639
the food was hot when it was prepared as

196
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,759
soon as my mom had the food ready she

197
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,759
would call us down me my father my

198
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,479
sibling we would join her and have a

199
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,199
dinner together the microwave oven

200
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,160
changes that it makes it such that

201
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,639
people can have their meals

202
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,400
independently they can just go grab

203
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,199
their food from the fridge heat it up

204
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
and have it at their own time this

205
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,479
concept of having meals alone is not

206
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
human it's not natural the microwave

207
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,440
oven has pulled families apart by

208
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
destroying a central family tradition of

209
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,199
having meals together and this happened

210
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,120
at the same time as when both parents

211
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,000
had to work in order to make ends meat

212
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,639
and children spent far more time in

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,800
their penitentiaries which they call the

214
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,599
public school system instead of playing

215
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,319
and enjoying nature being with their

216
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,440
parents being with siblings and friends

217
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,879
but I suppose that's a topic for a

218
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,720
different video I do absolutely want to

219
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,000
make a video on the education system and

220
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,639
how to essentially deprogram the wiring

221
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
which they gave us so here's a challenge

222
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,520
to you if you're so invested in

223
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,000
improving your life and avoiding toxins

224
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,400
the first step you can do to really make

225
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,479
your life better is to fix your family

226
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,919
relationships call your mom call your

227
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,759
dad call your grandparents actually

228
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,400
schedule a reminder on your phone like

229
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,199
for for real this is a high Roi task

230
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,759
schedule a reminder on your phone for

231
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
every single week you talk to your

232
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,680
grandparents and parents at least once a

233
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
week Imagine the health benefits that

234
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,160
they're going to receive their stress is

235
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,960
going to go lower which genuinely has

236
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,840
physiological effects on their body the

237
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,280
most honorable things you can do is to

238
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
take care of your parents and honor your

239
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,080
ancestors and that's far more important

240
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,080
than being scared of a microwave of them
