1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm going to share with you the magic

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,040
wand that changes your face this is the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,000
REM straw I'm not sponsored by them I

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
don't make any money by promoting them I

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,280
just thought this might be valuable to

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,640
you so I'm sharing it it's essentially a

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,560
silicone nozzle on a standard metallic

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,640
straw and that's just what it is the

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,519
interesting part is how they've designed

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,960
this nozzle like the shape of this thing

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,599
it's shaped in such a way that you

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,599
cannot just suck water through this

13
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,759
there's a specific way in which you need

14
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,880
to position your tongue and your pallet

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,760
that forces you to apply pressure on the

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,480
roof of your mouth it's a lot like

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,879
mewing but it's just stronger you apply

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,120
way more pressure and in a different way

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,840
than usual that it causes your face to

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,559
change it applies pressure to your

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,440
maxilla which basically the more

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,760
prominent or I should say the better

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,039
developed your maxilla the overall wider

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,239
your face is going to be the more

25
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,239
handsome you're going to look now you

26
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,520
already probably know this because every

27
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,440
single video on Mee on the planet

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
explains this so there's no reason for

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,920
me to do so again there used to be a

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,720
time in which Mee was this underground

31
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,000
phenomenon but now everybody knows it

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
it's a meme so I won't bore you with

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,520
boring Mee stuff I'll show you the new

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,759
stuff this straw was designed to prevent

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
people from snoring now the actual

36
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,280
technique on using this is kind of

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,040
confusing so I'll do the best I can with

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,040
a demonstration I have a glass of water

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,840
with me I have the REM straw it's

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,040
basically done like this all right so so

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,799
pay attention all

42
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,920
right uh I don't know where to start

43
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,479
with this first start by making the N

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,320
sound so n when you do that your tip of

45
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,439
the tongue is going to touch a specific

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,399
part of your mouth basically the um the

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,640
bump right behind the teeth right so try

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,960
to do it for yourself right now say and

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,439
and feel where the tongue lies on the

50
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,200
roof of your mouth all right keep that

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,680
in your mind so when you use this thing

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
what you're doing is you put this in

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,719
your

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,159
mouth and then you press the tip of your

55
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,880
tongue to that same spot that you

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,920
connected with when you made the N sound

57
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,759
so your tongue is basically going to

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,520
going to press against this part of the

59
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,399
nozzle so if you look at this carefully

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,480
and I'll I'll put in b-roll which kind

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,800
of zooms into this you are placing your

62
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,640
lips right here right not on the actual

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
bump on the nozzle so it's going to look

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,840
like

65
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,120
this all right and you're going to place

66
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,040
the tongue right here to essentially

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
shift this like this to the roof of your

68
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,080
mouth all right so this thing is facing

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,200
like like in there pressing the tip of

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,519
the tongue against this part and you're

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,239
using the middle of the tongue to

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
actually cause the suction required to

73
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,760
drink the water so imagine this right

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,599
this is this is the roof of the mouth

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,159
this is your tongue this is going to be

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,800
your teeth so you start like this with

77
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,280
the tip of the tongue touching the top

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,319
of the roof of the mouth or the front of

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,959
the roof of the mouth I should say from

80
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,239
here

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,640
you bring down the mid of the tongue

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,920
which causes a vacuum which sucks in the

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,799
water and then you press up against it

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,720
to force the water to go into your

85
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,120
throat so essentially you're doing this

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
right with your tongue in order to get

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,720
the water down your throat you can

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,080
obviously understand how that's going to

89
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,959
apply a pulsating pressure to the roof

90
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,879
of your mouth your and that's going to

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,120
apply pressure to the maxilla and that's

92
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,200
going to change the structure of your

93
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,239
face so the main benefit isn't even even

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,680
the structure of your face there are

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
other benefits but I will explain after

96
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,120
the actual demonstration so I have I'm

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
going to do it I'm not going to speak

98
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,519
obviously I'm just going to do it and

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,519
you're going to see how it

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,200
looks all right even after doing it for

101
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,799
only a few seconds I'm going to this let

102
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,920
this uh airplane fly

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,599
overhead even after I do it for just a

104
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,280
few seconds right I can feel these

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,040
muscles engaging I'm not even sure why

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,480
that is why the neck muscles would be so

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,599
involved in the tongue movement but it's

108
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,639
the case I mean in the end of the day

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,400
like all the muscles of the how would

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,479
you say the airway system of our body

111
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,880
are interconnected so I'm not entirely

112
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,919
surprised that the next muscles are

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,400
involved in the movement of your jaw and

114
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,560
your tongue and of course the tongue is

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,120
actually a very important structural

116
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,960
muscle most people just think of the

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
tongue as a thing which tastes food it's

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,360
not true the tongue is one of the

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
pillars keeping your head in a stable

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,960
position of course your neck is the main

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,720
pillar but your tongue is in some sense

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
muscularly attached to your neck the the

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,120
structure of your head is supported by

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,360
the neck muscles and then the tongue in

125
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,120
the middle regardless we getting getting

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,880
way off topic I think when you when I

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,600
did the demonstration you could see that

128
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,720
my cheeks were not engaged they were not

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,479
I was not using the cheek muscles to

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,680
swallow I was using the tongue and the

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,680
throat muscles to swallow this is very

132
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,919
important and I'm going to explain this

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,400
this teaches the correct movement

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,320
pattern to swallow food so essentially

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
you're using this to learn how to

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,440
swallow food correctly and that is of

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,880
course a lifelong habit this has obvious

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,160
benefits for your jawline but also for

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,199
digestion in fact you will stop craving

140
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,800
fast food candy and packaged Foods if

141
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,560
you actually chew properly let me

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,000
explain myself the reason is because

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,759
these corrupt food scientists they've

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,880
engineered the food in such a way that

145
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,960
they're overstimulating for the first

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,520
few seconds of chewing so that you get

147
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,600
addicted to it if you actually chewed

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,800
your junk food your if you actually

149
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,280
chewed your junk food your candy your

150
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,199
packaged Goods more the real flavor

151
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,479
starts to emerge and it doesn't taste

152
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,160
good you can try this experiment for

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,120
yourself if you chew and unhealthy food

154
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,599
any unhealthy food for a longer period

155
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,039
of time it will taste like on the

156
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,840
other hand if you have a whole food meal

157
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,240
steak and potatoes or even something

158
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,000
more basic like chicken and rice it will

159
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,919
actually taste good as you chew more in

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,639
fact more flavors will be unlocked as

161
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
you chew now of course you need to be a

162
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,199
good Chef essentially you need to know

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,160
how to prepare good food if you want the

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,360
return of the old style cooking videos

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,080
let me know in the comments but why is

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,840
this this is because these corrup food

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,240
scientists have hijacked your brain and

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,080
they can only hijack your brain for a

169
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,199
few seconds basically if you're eating

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,360
like Cheetos or something it has uh what

171
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,960
do you call it MSG it tricks your brain

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,639
into thinking this is highly highly

173
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,960
nutritious food but only for a few

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,520
seconds if you give your body time to

175
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,319
analyze the truth you know analyze the

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,560
food using your chemical receptors which

177
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,720
is your tongue so what is taste taste is

178
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,319
chemical signals it's information about

179
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,639
the world right it is

180
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,520
not just for your enjoyment taste is not

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,759
something for your enjoyment taste is

182
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,599
created as a system to assess the

183
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,720
nutritional value and the risks of food

184
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
because food can obviously be spoiled or

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,400
it can contain parasites whatever right

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,199
so taste is a function that prevents you

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
from eating unhealthy food and eating

188
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,639
healthy food the modern day we have

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,479
foods which act as though they're hyper

190
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,360
healthy by tricking the brain but

191
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,280
they're actually not just give your

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,759
taste receptors time to act and the

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,199
truth truth will come out think about

194
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,560
the downstream effects you crave snacks

195
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,440
because you perceive a dopamine reward

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,680
if you can teach your brain that the

197
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,280
reward isn't real not through logic not

198
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
through watching educational YouTube

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,159
video but through experience how

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,840
valuable is it to pass on this skill of

201
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,879
correct chewing to your children and

202
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,879
your grandchildren if you incorporate

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,199
mindful eating you will eat better food

204
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,800
it is that simple but coming back to the

205
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,680
REM straw the REM straw was designed of

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
course to improve breathing and prevent

207
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,680
snoring and when we speak about looks

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,159
looks is Downstream of two things it's

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,280
health and genetic quality and of course

210
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,720
health is more within our control than

211
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,879
our genetic quality is that being said

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
look out for the esoteric epigenetics

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,440
guide when it comes to health the

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,000
quality of our breathing is such an

215
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,080
underrated Factor this is of personal

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,759
importance to me because I had breathing

217
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,039
problems for years I have recorded an

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,200
updated esoteric breathing guide and if

219
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,680
I had this guide 6 years ago I would not

220
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,039
have needed to go through surgery to fix

221
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,919
my breathing if you have learned

222
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,959
something new in this video you should

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,519
watch that video next I will place it in

224
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,440
the end screen tile I will show you the

225
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,760
exact techniques that you haven't seen

226
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,760
before and devices that you have not

227
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,720
seen before with that I'll close out

228
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,640
remember if you do not sacrifice for

229
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,399
your dreams your dreams become the

230
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,399
sacrifice
