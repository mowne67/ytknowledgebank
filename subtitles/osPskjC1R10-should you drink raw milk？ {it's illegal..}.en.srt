1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,640
this bottle of raw milk says on it right

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:08,240
here not for human consumption it

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,360
literally says on here for intermittent

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,719
feed used only for dogs and cats but

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
I've been drinking this for more than a

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,119
year I will tell you the story of raw

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,160
milk it's god tier benefits for hormonal

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,199
function as well as gut health I'll

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,320
expose the demonization of raw milk by

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,439
governmental organizations and a certain

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
Mega Corporation by the name of Monsanto

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,560
I'll give you my personal experience

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
teach you where to find the stuff I'll

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,320
also clear up the whole controversy

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,559
between A1 and A2 milk I'll give you the

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,200
full milk tier list and tell you exactly

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,920
which milks you should consider and

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
which ones you should

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,600
reject that being said everything in

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,920
this video is my own personal views and

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
my experience this is not medical advice

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
see most people don't know this but

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,640
drinking raw milk isn't even that risky

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,160
if you actually run the numbers and look

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,160
at how many people have actually died or

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,320
gotten sick due to raw milk versus other

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,719
Foods in general raw milk doesn't really

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,840
stand out as a massive public health

29
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,360
hazard at all I mean think about lettuce

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
every every now and then you always hear

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,560
this headline people died or got sick

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
because of an outbreak of eoli in

33
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,840
lettuce in like Chipotle or something

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
but there's no movement for Banning

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,920
lettuce and yet in many states it's a

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,400
felony to sell raw milk the Industrial

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Revolution and its consequences have

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,000
been a disaster for the human race and

39
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,439
definitely for cows as industrial plants

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
grew and more people moved towards

41
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,640
cities and got clustered in these

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
claustrophobic cities they brought their

43
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,759
C with them and these cows they were

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
living under horrible torturous

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
conditions and to be fair the humans

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,000
themselves were living in very bad

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,479
conditions so I understand it but these

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,200
cows were ridden with parasites which is

49
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,840
a separate topic they were living with

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,000
their own feces they were living in

51
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,960
extremely stressed environments and so

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,680
they were imuno compromised and when

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,719
they produced milk yeah this milk was

54
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,159
not good for people got them sick and of

55
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,880
course the Industrial Revolution is

56
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,360
always there for the rescue the

57
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,920
technique of pasteurization which is

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
nothing more than just heating the milk

59
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,039
basically kills the milk it kills the

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,680
milk milk is supposed to be a living

61
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,720
food milk has living organisms in it

62
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,840
which actually aid in digestion and gut

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,000
health it has enzymes in it which

64
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,720
actually help you to digest the milk so

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
when you pasteurize it you lose the

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,640
enzymes you lose the living microbes you

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,160
just have this dead liquid which is

68
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,519
chemically the same as raw milk but

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,800
biologically

70
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,599
different So speaking of pasteurization

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,640
I said that pasteurization entally kills

72
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
the milk and this is exactly why a lot

73
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,040
of people who are lactose intolerant

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
those who cannot buy and drink the

75
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,200
store-bought milk they actually fine

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,040
drinking raw milk this is because raw

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,280
milk actually is easier to digest

78
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,280
because the bacteria in there and the

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,519
enzymes in there actually make the body

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
more able to actually digest the milk I

81
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,319
suppose it goes without saying that raw

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
milk is a probiotic it helps the gut

83
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,040
microbiome and here's what happened in

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
the grand scheme so big farms which

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,239
could afford the pasturization equipment

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,440
they would pump out huge volumes of milk

87
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,360
and because they had increased the shelf

88
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,920
life through pasteurization they could

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,480
drive down the cost and they could

90
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,440
therefore outcompete all the small farms

91
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,560
which are making an honest day living by

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
giving you raw milk and so today we end

93
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,000
up in a situation where to buy raw milk

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,560
can be challenging luckily I have a

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
solution for you I'll teach you exactly

96
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,840
where to get raw milk without any milk

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,519
but of course the bigger problem is the

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
artificial hormone issue the RBST issue

99
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,159
so a lot of countries have banned RBST

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,640
but not the us though so what happened

101
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,720
here is there's a genetics company

102
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,599
called Genentech and they created this

103
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,959
artificial hormone called RBST and

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,480
eventually Monsanto came to own the like

105
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,319
the IP the intellectual property for

106
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,680
creating that stuff and just understand

107
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,879
the understand this properly so they

108
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
take the cows they inject them with this

109
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,480
artificial hormone which causes them to

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,720
lactate more and therefore produce more

111
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,040
milk what this does to the cows is truly

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,519
inhumane it causes the cows mamory

113
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,000
glands their breast tissue to come over

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,959
tax and diseased these cows have a

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,040
higher chance of going lame these cows

116
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,680
also have a weakened immune system which

117
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,920
now means that you have to pump these

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,439
cows full of antibiotics to keep them

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,599
alive and this apparently is the more

120
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,640
healthy option as compared to raw milk

121
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,879
and despite all this the FDA says that

122
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,599
milk with and without RBST are the same

123
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,199
thing and of course I haven't even

124
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,160
touched on the topic of xenoestrogens it

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,560
should be pretty obvious that the

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
artificial hormone which literally

127
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,280
causes cow to lactate more is a

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
xenoestrogen xenoestrogen are basically

129
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,360
estrogen like compounds which will cause

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,039
a man to get more feminine trait and

131
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,520
it's certainly not good for females

132
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,840
either because it essentially out

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
competes with natural female estrogen

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,639
and causes serious harm to the female

135
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,280
reproductive system as well so it's no

136
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,240
joke and certainly not the only Hazard

137
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,080
here so grain-fed cows get understand

138
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,120
this so grain is already a problem

139
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,560
because grain gets moldy and mold

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,440
contains something called Zea which is a

141
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,720
xenoestrogen that's certainly a problem

142
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,120
on itself but there's even more to it

143
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,160
when cows eat grain instead of grass

144
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,880
they're rumin so the rumin is a part of

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,800
the cow's digestive tract it becomes

146
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,560
more acidic than it's supposed to and

147
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,400
what that means is the eoli which might

148
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,199
be present in that digestive tract

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
evolve to become acid resistant why is

150
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,400
that a problem for you it's because your

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,560
digestive system the digestive system of

152
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,240
humans is a pretty remarkable piece of

153
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,520
equipment our digestive acids can

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
destroy ecoli most of the time but if

155
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,280
you feed cows with grain and the ecoli

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
in their gut becomes acid resistant now

157
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,680
that ecoli when enters your gut is still

158
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
acid resistant and this is the stuff

159
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,600
that can actually make you sick so

160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,000
that's why I get my milk from grass-fed

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,280
cows producing raw milk there was a farm

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,199
in Maine which wanted to put on their

163
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,880
milk bottles a label which said we don't

164
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,880
use artificial hormones and Monsanto

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
came for them with their entire Army of

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,319
Gremlin verminous lawyers because they

167
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,720
said that if that farm in in Maine said

168
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,479
that their milk was free from RBST they

169
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,600
were implying buying that milk that does

170
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,680
have rbsd is inferior that is to say

171
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,360
monsanto's so-called milk was inferior

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,800
which it is and they actually took that

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
farm to court and that farm was forced

174
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,039
to have a disclaimer on their label

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,680
saying that the FDA does not see a

176
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,840
difference between milk with RBST and

177
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,599
milk without RBST how twisted is that a

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
farm doesn't even have the Liberty to

179
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,720
say that they don't use artificial

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,319
hormones that's how twisted the system

181
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,840
behind this is because of how much money

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
is involved when that FDA tells me that

183
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,199
the very same kind of milk which my

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,120
ancestors have been drinking for

185
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,440
hundreds of thousands of years is

186
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,720
actually the enemy and their Factory

187
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,720
farmed ultr processed dairy product

188
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,560
which barely is milk is the safer option

189
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,800
I find myself rejecting them in a world

190
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,880
where the government legalizes alcohol

191
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,919
and weed and prohibits the sale of raw

192
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,800
milk to Consumers and when the CDC

193
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,879
recognizes raw milk to be a public

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,120
health hazard I have have very little

195
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,960
patience so now the question becomes is

196
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,840
it worth it and the answer is definitely

197
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,919
yes definitely been worth it for me for

198
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,039
two reasons specifically one is the

199
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
joint health reason so raw milk contains

200
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,800
something called bolsen factor which

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
basically helps heal and improve joint

202
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,199
health this was personally important to

203
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,000
me because almost a year ago I took an

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,440
injury to the right elbow and left knee

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,879
which really put me out of the gym and I

206
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,280
only now slowly getting back into it and

207
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,680
then finally we have of course the gut

208
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,400
microbiome benefits which are the

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,400
easiest to understand this stuff

210
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,319
literally contains live bacteria which

211
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,000
is why I will not leave this on the

212
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,720
table for very long I'll keep it in the

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,080
fridge as soon as this video is done and

214
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,800
finally we come to the actionable steps

215
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,479
I'm going to break down exactly how

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,159
where and when to consume this milk

217
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,759
right so the easiest way to get milk

218
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,759
like how how I get it is from local

219
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,080
grocery market so just literally search

220
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,360
on Google organic grocery near me and

221
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
you'll often find one I lived in the

222
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,479
small little town in Indiana for what 6

223
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,479
years now and only 2 years ago did I

224
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,280
realize there was a small cute little

225
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,599
organic grocery store literally 10

226
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,720
minutes away from where I live so if you

227
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,919
don't search for it you're not going to

228
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,599
find it I'll link in the description

229
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,319
below to a website which you'll find

230
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,960
local farms near you it's called

231
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,240
realmilk.com and it will link you to the

232
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
nearest farm which produces raw

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,000
milk A1 versus A2 milk what's that

234
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,919
entire controversy about all right I'll

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,639
make it super simple for you I'm not

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
trying to waste your time A2 milk is

237
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,720
good A1 milk is bad so it all comes down

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,120
to the breed of cow which produces it

239
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,039
and the protein structure in the milk

240
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,560
itself so when A1 milk is digested it

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,640
can break down in some people into

242
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
something called bcm7 which is an

243
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,959
inflammatory substance and not only that

244
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,959
it even seems to have an effect on

245
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,680
opioid receptors yes weird stuff now not

246
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,600
everybody reacts the same way for you it

247
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,040
may not matter for me I just want to

248
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,360
keep it safe A2 is more digestible so

249
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm just going to go for A2 if I have a

250
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,640
choice if you're getting raw milk from a

251
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,320
farm you can actually ask them what

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
breed of cow they use and you can just

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,720
Google it and find out what kind of milk

254
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,640
they produce in the US it's mainly two

255
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,959
breeds Holstein and Jersey cows Jersey

256
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,560
cows produce A2 Holstein cows produce A1

257
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,880
so you want to look for Jersey cows if

258
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,640
you can find them and finally we must

259
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,279
discuss chocolate milk chocolate milk as

260
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,560
you know comes from brown cows and is

261
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:15,480
known to increase testosterone by 69.6

262
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,240
n% but for real though so um Brown milk

263
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,720
actually contains a lot of CLA which is

264
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,600
conjugated lolic acid which does

265
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,120
actually improve

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
testosterone and I have some good news

267
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,760
so the tide is turning and I see this in

268
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,120
real life so one year ago when I started

269
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,040
purchasing raw milk from their little

270
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,040
grocery store I mentioned they would

271
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,640
often just run out of raw milk because

272
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,480
so many people were coming and grabbing

273
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,000
them which tells me there's a demand

274
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,079
growing for this stuff and there's an

275
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
awareness growing about raw milk and

276
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,800
what happened was nowadays they don't

277
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,760
run out of milk because the farm which

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,320
produces it had enough money enough

279
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,079
resources to purchase more cows so it's

280
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,279
happening right now boys so this

281
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:56,120
movement of moving towards Natural Foods

282
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,279
is happening right now and I want you to

283
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,480
capitalize on this I want you to create

284
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,320
businesses which literally produce

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,600
better stuff you don't have to invent

286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,320
anything new Just Produce better stuff

287
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,079
more natural less toxic stuff and just

288
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,279
watch your business grow over the next 5

289
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,040
to 10 years companies which make real

290
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,079
authentic products are growing and

291
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
they're making money if you told people

292
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,160
that applying animal fat on your skin is

293
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,519
actually better than any product out

294
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,760
there in the drug stores and that you

295
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,839
don't need like a whole bunch of

296
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,720
products and you use one product they

297
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,320
probably look at you funny except that

298
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,240
companies like vintage tradition and

299
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,880
plenty others have been growing years

300
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,279
after year this is possible because of

301
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,079
this awareness which is growing

302
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,920
currently now is the time to create

303
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:38,800
products which are genuinely better than

304
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,720
the Legacy stuff because the market is

305
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,200
there the opportunity is there it's time

306
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,600
for you to get all into it I have a full

307
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,920
esoteric nutrition course which

308
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,399
literally breaks down everything you

309
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
need to know about hormonal Health

310
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,560
metabolic Health gut health and

311
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,880
everything you could possibly want to

312
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,800
know about nutrition so if you're

313
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,720
interested in that it's included for

314
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,240
free within my private Community the

315
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,639
links in the description

316
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,040
now I'm going to tell you which milks

317
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,360
are worth consuming on the top the king

318
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,519
we have of course raw milk not

319
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,399
pasteurized not homogenized and this can

320
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,360
be either cow milk or goat milk or shape

321
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,920
milk or camel milk if you can find that

322
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,480
that's the highly esoteric option if you

323
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,959
have freaking camel milk then good for

324
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,000
you man below that you have something

325
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,639
called low temperature pasteurized

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,600
non-homogenized this is something you'll

327
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,120
find in some grocery stores not all of

328
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,160
them but this is also a good option I

329
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,519
would 100% recommend that and I should

330
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
note that the both options I've

331
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,040
mentioned so far I assume that they

332
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,600
grass-fed grass finished then we start

333
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,720
moving on to the options which I don't

334
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,320
consume pasteurized ultra pasteurized

335
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
the stuff in the cartons so let me

336
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,040
explain this so milk that you find in

337
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,240
cartons in your grocery store that's not

338
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,639
just pasteurized that's ultra

339
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,399
pasteurized at that point I would

340
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,040
consider just to be another processed

341
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,160
food and I would dismiss it and then

342
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,399
even lower than that we have skim milks

343
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,720
you have the 2% 1% and skim milk at that

344
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,040
point like why why would you drink such

345
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,600
a thing that's barely even milk so yeah

346
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,480
that's an easy rejection section and

347
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,920
under that we have of course the nut

348
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,680
milks and soy milks why would anybody

349
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,560
drink something literally called nut

350
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,000
milk just based on the name alone I

351
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,680
would not consume such a thing of course

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
bottom of the barrel we have your soy

353
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,079
milk so really you don't even have that

354
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,320
many options and of course I should just

355
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,959
have a disclaimer saying none of this is

356
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
a dietary recommendation and if you

357
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,639
don't have access to this I would

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,560
suggest going and getting kefir instead

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,320
Keir is a um a fermented product and I

360
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,160
should say fermented products across the

361
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,079
board are really good one for the

362
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,199
microbiome benefits but also because

363
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,760
fermentation itself destroys estrogens

364
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,680
so you could find buttermilk yogurt

365
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,680
kefir all these are good options what

366
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,079
for

367
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,959
me so first I'm going to have to shake

368
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,959
this thing this is non-homogenized milk

369
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,320
which means that the cream will

370
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,560
basically float to the top so open this

371
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,600
up pour myself some raw milk purchased

372
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,240
literally just today so question how

373
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
does raw milk

374
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,720
taste raw milk tastes Rich it tastes

375
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,519
velvety it tastes a little bit sweet too

376
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
because the this is the first day right

377
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,920
this is literally the first day I got it

378
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,880
so it contains a lot of the sugar still

379
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
in there so it tastes wonderful and it

380
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,360
even has a little chunks of cream in it

381
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
which makes it even more delectable but

382
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,760
every day that passes the bacteria is

383
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,320
going to consume some of that sugar so

384
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,839
it will lose some of its sweetness which

385
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,240
is fine it's still nutritious but I'm

386
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,800
just pointing that out because it's not

387
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,279
that your milk is going bad it's just

388
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,480
that some of the sugars been consumed

389
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,440
and raw milk will stay good for 7 days

390
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,240
so when should you drink this this this

391
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,720
is the ultimate post-workout snack

392
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,839
there's literally nothing which gets

393
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,360
better than this when it comes to

394
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,199
post-workout but of course like I'm not

395
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,639
your boss man you can drink this anytime

396
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,240
there's there's no like right time or

397
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,240
wrong time go go go go
