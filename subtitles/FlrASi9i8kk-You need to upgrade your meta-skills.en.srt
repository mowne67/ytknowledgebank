1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
When Michelangelo was 17, he was

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,560
obsessed about cutting open human bodies

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,759
to see what was inside. This was despite

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,760
the fact that this was a crime

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,719
punishable by death in Florence at the

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
time. If you're struggling with fear and

7
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,679
uncertainty about the future, then this

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
is the video that you need to watch to

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
understand what is possible when a man

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,240
decides to bet everything on himself.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,880
Our story starts when Michelangelo turns

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,119
15. And what he does is he does these 2D

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
sculptures in marble for his local

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,600
church. As he's doing this, his talent

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,640
is of course recognized and he gets a

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
first big commission of a 9-ft tall

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,480
Hercules statue. This is the first 3D

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,640
model he's done and certainly the first

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,960
lifesize model that he has done. So a

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
project above his threshold, above his

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,559
comfort zone, certainly he takes on this

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
project and he do does something

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,399
important. He creates a clay model of

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,879
the Hercules as he envisioned it. But in

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
doing so, he realized he doesn't

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
actually have the skills he needs. He

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
doesn't understand how the weight

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,360
distribution works, the way the muscles

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,799
should tense and relax to make that pose

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,119
possible. So, he needs to upgrade his

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,680
skills. He needs to learn how human

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
anatomy actually works. And at the time,

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,119
there was no resources that could teach

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
him this. There was no professors he

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,119
could go to, no books that he could

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,920
read. He needed to create the body of

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
knowledge needed to pull this off and

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
the money situation. This made it even

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
more challenging. So the commissioner

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,119
who asked him commissioned him to make

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
this Hercules did not pay for the raw

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
material. So he didn't have the marble

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
to begin with. So he had to go and buy

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
his own marble which was at the time and

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,920
now very expensive.

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,520
So Michelangelo has been saving money

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
for the past 2 years trying to save

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,600
every single penny that he can and he

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,799
saves up a total of four gold Florence

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,759
the currency at the time. So 2 years of

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,799
savings, four gold Florence, spends it

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,520
on a big block of marble without having

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
ever done that kind of a project before.

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,080
That's the kind of man who bets on

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,000
himself. Now he doesn't have the skills.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
He doesn't have savings anymore. His

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,040
father was adamantly against this

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
project. Why? Because it's risky. The

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
father was like, "Hey, you should just

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,879
go into the family business. Just do

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,440
what's tested. Just do the thing which

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
is safe." But Michelangelo was not

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
comfortable or he wasn't he wasn't

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
willing to take that path. Instead, he

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,840
did what was not comfortable. He bet his

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
life savings and has his marble. Now,

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
the skill issue. How does he address

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,480
this? He decides that he needs to

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
understand the underlying mechanism of

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,560
what makes the skin take the form that

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
it takes. Michelangelo didn't understand

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,519
what it took to make a truly lifelike

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
sculpture with the veins and the muscles

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
and the tendons and the ligaments

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
actually in place with the correct

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,319
amount of strain. So, he had to dissect

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,560
human bodies. How does he get them?

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,920
Well, he couldn't access the dead bodies

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,599
of the rich because these graves were in

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,840
uh family graves and these were well

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,560
protected. He couldn't access the graves

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
of the middle class folk simply because

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
well they had these elaborate rituals

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,159
which which they would bury them and he

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,560
was afraid to incur some kind of curse.

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,239
He would be limited to the corpses of

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
the beggars and the orphans, the

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,360
unwanted corpses of Florence. So he

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,239
would go at night into the charity

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,560
hospital and into the morg snuck in and

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
he would carry this candle. When that

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
candle starts to go out, it means his

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,959
time is up and he needs to leave in in

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
case he gets

95
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,959
discovered. So every night for months,

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
he's dissecting bodies. He's taking

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
notes. He's making sketches.

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Michelangelo at the time was more

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,720
experienced, has cut up more bodies than

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,280
actual anatomists and more morticians of

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,159
the era. He put in more reps than the

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,040
actual professionals of that field. He

103
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,720
has even cut up all the animals. Every

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
single animal that is known in Italy at

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,560
the time, he had cut up to try to

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,080
understand the

107
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,200
musculature. So once he returns to that

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040
clay model now, after months, if not a

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
year of training and looking at the

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,840
actual insides of the bodies, he finally

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
understood what he needed to do. He

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
understood how the weight balance of

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
that clay sculpture worked. He

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
understood what ligaments should be

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,080
taught, what should be relaxed, which

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,479
muscles would be uh acting as he built

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,919
out this

118
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:35,520
Hercules. Then it's the time to take

119
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,120
that clay model and make it the 9 ft

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
marble model. And he still doesn't have

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,759
experience with this. So he makes a

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,199
grave mistake. He starts to chisel away

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
the parts of the marble that you don't

124
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
need because you're first trying to

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,320
create the overall sculpture, the

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,120
overall structure of the statue before

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,040
he puts in the fine details. In so

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,320
doing, he goes way too narrow on the

129
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,000
neck. What you're supposed to do is

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,479
leave a good amount of marble around the

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
neck so that any tremors going from

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,479
above below the body to the above

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
wouldn't just break the head off. But he

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,160
didn't know. So he went too deep. As

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
he's sculpting the shoulder musculature

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,360
of the Hercules, he realizes that the

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
tremors were traveling up the neck and

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
kind of shaking the head. But luck would

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,560
be with him and the head did not fall

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,960
off. Hercules kept his head and

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,840
Michelangelo kept his commission. He was

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,639
able to sell that piece for 100

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,520
Florence. He invested four Florence in

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,120
and got a 100 out, 25x return on his

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,680
investment. But that's just the

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,919
beginning of Michelangelo's career. In

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
fact, this is the most crudest of his

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,800
sculptures. He would go on in the next

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,360
four years to sculpt the Pieta and this

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,560
sculpture whole new level. And for this

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,720
sculpture, he's paid 400 gold Florence,

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
100x his initial investment. Now, it

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
would be easy to assume that

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,440
Michelangelo was just born a genius. And

155
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,400
maybe he was, but nobody can deny that

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,400
he put in the reps. and not just any

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
reps, but the kind of reps that nobody

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
else was willing to put in. In fact,

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
even the tools, he didn't have the tools

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
needed to pull off what he pulled off.

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
So, he had to design and invent his own

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,960
tools in order to do the sculpting that

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,680
he did. So, to recap, Michelangelo

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
starts off without the skills. Not just

165
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
that, but he doesn't even have the

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,960
knowledge base required. So, he had to

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
go out and create the knowledge base. He

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,319
had to create the encyclopedic knowledge

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,919
of human anatomy to actually pull off

170
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
the sculpture. Didn't have the

171
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,080
knowledge. Didn't have the tools. So he

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,880
had to design the tools. In the modern

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,800
time that we live in, is there anything

174
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,560
comparable? For almost every project

175
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
that you ever want to do, the knowledge

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,039
base already exists. You want to create

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
a e-commerce store, there's courses out

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,720
there. There's YouTube videos. All the

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,440
knowledge is already out there. you want

180
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,000
a career in a big company software

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,360
company and in Amazon the process for

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,919
getting into those companies is actually

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,639
well documented and you can just follow

184
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,000
that probably will get in all the

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
problems all the knowledge based

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
problems are solved except for the ones

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
which are at the absolute cutting edge

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
of physics like how do you build a Mars

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
colony now that's a problem which hasn't

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,599
been solved yet but that too might be

191
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,039
solved in the years to come the tools we

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,120
have all the tools we would need to

193
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,960
start a business or any other pursuit.

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
We have the tools in place. If you want

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
to start a website, website builders

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,280
exist. It's not like in 2001 where you

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
had to kind of work on WordPress and

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
create your own website. You can just

199
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,960
drag and drop. Email senders exist. If

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
you're trying to create a physical

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,759
products company, there are

202
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
manufacturers out there who will work

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
with lowQ, which is minimum order

204
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,800
quantity, and help you get your first

205
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,479
prototypes out. So, all the tools exist.

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,199
So, what's stopping you? There's

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,280
absolutely no reasons except the fact

208
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,520
that you feel like you need permission.

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,039
That's I think the core part of the

210
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,319
Michelangelo story which resonated with

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,240
me which is he decided to act and take

212
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,960
these bold actions without the

213
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
permission of his father. When we grow

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
up, one of the core and if not the core

215
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,759
authority figure in our lives is our

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,759
fathers, sometimes our mothers. If

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
you're young, start disobeying your

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
parents more. Do it early. Do it a lot.

219
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
do it when you don't feel comfortable

220
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,840
doing it. Now, coming back to the story

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,479
of Michelangelo, he sets his sights on

222
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,080
his next project. He comes to know of

223
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,520
this legendary massive block of marble

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,519
40 ft high which was left abandoned in

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,039
the courtyard of a church. Now, he he

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
talks to this church and what's happened

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
is this this marble was actually damaged

228
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039
by previous sculptures. So, it was an

229
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
imperfect piece of marble, massive,

230
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
bigger than anything he had done before.

231
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,360
But he gets the commission and this

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,560
legendary piece of marble is what's

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,560
destined to become the David. Again,

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
another 10x jump from where he was

235
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,200
before in terms of the skill required to

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,080
pull this off. If you look at the David,

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,519
you the details are insane and you'll

238
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,800
miss them if you don't know what you're

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,279
looking for. David's hands, one of them

240
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,279
is holding the sling and the other is

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,200
left limp by his side. The hand which is

242
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
holding the sling, you'll notice that

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,560
his veins are not visible. But the hand

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,360
which is by his side, his veins are

245
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,120
popping and quite quite visible. This is

246
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
exactly what would happen to an actual

247
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,800
human being in a state of arousal with

248
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,959
the hands in this position. So by the

249
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,320
fact that when he was 17, he was

250
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,080
dissecting the bodies and understanding

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
how the circulatory system of the human

252
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,320
body works. He was able to understand

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,959
how blood would flow in an actual human

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,240
being and replicate this in marble.

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,560
Another great example, the statue of

256
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,600
Moses, which was upon the Pope's tomb

257
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,800
that he was commissioned to

258
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,839
sculpt. This the figure of Moses has his

259
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,440
hand like this. There's a small muscle

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,080
on Moses's forearm which is engaged.

261
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,160
That muscle is only ever engaged if your

262
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,920
pinky is flexed. Most sculptors would

263
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,760
not know this, but Michelangelo did

264
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
because he put in reps and not just any

265
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,680
reps, but the exceptional reps because

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
he could just do things. At this point

267
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,200
in his career, Michelangelo has

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
established himself as one of the

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
greatest. He's now in competition with

270
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,240
the old master himself, Leonardo da

271
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,399
Vinci. And then his prestige improves

272
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,839
even more because Pope commisss him to

273
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,440
paint and design the dome of St. Peters

274
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
and of course the Sistine Chapel, the

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
painting of the Sistine Chapel. So he

276
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,560
was a sculptor, right? He doesn't know

277
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,360
how to paint. So he develops a whole new

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,160
skill set of painting. And of course he

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,480
created the masterwork of God creating

280
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,120
Adam. He creates the he also does the

281
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,360
wall of the 16th chapel which is another

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,680
masterwork. But in so doing he takes on

283
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,800
sacrifice. Painting a ceiling very

284
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,920
difficult. He's working for 18 hours a

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,519
day in this position looking upwards.

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,959
And the strain that this puts on his

287
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,640
neck actually makes him go blind for

288
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,560
months. His his health almost never

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
recovers. When I see the struggles and

290
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
sacrifices of some of the greats, I find

291
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
that my own struggles and sacrifices

292
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,560
seem childish in comparison. For

293
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,040
example, me and Marlin, my cameraman. We

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,360
filmed one and a half hours in the cold

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
and the rain and we tried to make this

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
video about the big five personality

297
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
traits. It was a cool video and it was a

298
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
good take. We were satisfied with our

299
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,640
work. But when we head back home to edit

300
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,800
it, we found out that the audio wasn't

301
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,360
there. It wasn't recorded. All that work

302
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
in the rain, uh me trying to speak and

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
not really able to articulate my words

304
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,279
because it was so cold, our hands were

305
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
numb, but it didn't matter cuz the audio

306
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
wasn't there. So, we had to do

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,120
everything again. And guess what? That's

308
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,680
what Michelangelo had to do as well.

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,600
When Michelangelo did his first version

310
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,880
of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, he

311
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,800
found out that the paint was literally

312
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,200
molding. So he had to scrap the entire

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,360
project, redo all his work, and in fact

314
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,600
even invent new paints that wouldn't

315
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
mold. That's the level of dedication and

316
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
sacrifice it took for Michelangelo to be

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
great. And that's why it's inspiring to

318
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,399
me. You see Michelangelo, this guy who

319
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,959
is 17 years of age, he already knew what

320
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
he wanted to do and is willing to go at

321
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,279
to whatever lengths it took to make this

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
dream happen. I share this story because

323
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,920
my clients exemplifies the idea of you

324
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,079
can just do things. He didn't seek

325
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,120
permission. He didn't seek validation

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,800
from others. And validation from others

327
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,320
didn't even matter to him because his

328
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,079
standards were so high that others

329
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,760
standards were irrelevant. If he met his

330
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,600
own standards, then he would be good.

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,959
Nobody could really impeach him for

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
anything less. I think at this point in

333
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,880
the video, you understand that art and

334
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,079
the aesthetic experience is important to

335
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,480
me. It is. And we always hear this news

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,320
that AI is going to destroy art. AI is

337
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,480
going to replace artists. But it doesn't

338
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
have to. If you are an artist, you can

339
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,360
just desire to do things. You can just

340
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,120
make art. And if you are a businessman

341
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
or a consumer of art, you can just

342
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
choose to support those artists. You can

343
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
just choose to buy art instead of AI

344
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,720
slop. You can just do that. You don't

345
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,320
need to buy into the narrative that X is

346
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
happening. One of the things which I

347
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,079
want to succeed in before I die is

348
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,200
dedicate $1 million to creating

349
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,279
humanmade art. real art which has a

350
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,959
human and emotions behind it. I'm going

351
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,720
to display on the screen some of the

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,279
artworks which I've commissioned. First

353
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,240
artwork, the artist imagines Romans to

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,000
be in medieval armor. That's such a cool

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,279
concept. I really like it. The second

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,200
artwork, he describes or depicts the

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,440
crusader knights as they were. The

358
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,720
knights hospitaler, the knights templar,

359
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,399
the knights of Jerusalem and the knights

360
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,880
Tutonic. The third artwork, the

361
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
Renaissance uh Papal States artwork.

362
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
These are the warriors who guarded the

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,600
papacy. I've also commissioned two new

364
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,519
artworks. One of the glorious Spartans

365
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,519
in bronze defending the gates of of uh

366
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
Thermopoly. And the final artwork which

367
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
I've just commissioned is the samurai

368
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,160
warriors. And why do I do this? Because

369
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,800
again, I think a society would be a

370
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,199
better place with more actual art in it.

371
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,440
What I want to do is for 2026, I want to

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,600
create a calendar with 12 different art

373
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,360
pieces commissioned by the same artists.

374
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
If you're interested in following this

375
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
project and being a part of it, then

376
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
there's a form in the description below.

377
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,639
Give me your email and then when this

378
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,639
project is finally brought to fruition,

379
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,120
you'll be the first to learn about it.

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,560
Imagine the calendar, right? It has 12

381
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,199
epic art pieces and then a blurb about

382
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,360
each of these warrior types written by

383
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
me. To bring such a project to life

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,040
would be something that only I can do

385
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,760
because only I am interested in art in

386
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,079
this specific way. So this allows it to

387
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
be a part of my legacy. When I die, I

388
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,760
can look back at the things I've done

389
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,680
and this calendar would be one example

390
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,079
of a time where I spent my time and

391
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,240
resources in making society more

392
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,800
beautiful. If you feel that society is

393
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,680
not as beautiful as it was in history,

394
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,560
then it is your moral duty to fight

395
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,440
against the decline in beauty. So join

396
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,440
me and let's make society beautiful
