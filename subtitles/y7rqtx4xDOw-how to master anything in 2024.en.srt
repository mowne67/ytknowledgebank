1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,440
have you ever gotten caught cheating I

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,720
was sat there at the back of the lecture

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,760
hall we were having an exam we're having

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,000
an exam and the professor let's call her

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,400
professor s she was all the way on the

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,880
front left side she was quite far from

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,880
me so I didn't expect her to be able to

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,720
see me at all and this was a

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,840
thermodynamics exam if you know anything

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,760
about thermodynamics like it's a hard

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,480
subject so I had my answers um answer

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,520
sheets where I would write on I had my

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,760
question sheet and under the answer

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,200
sheet I had a little bit of extra notes

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,920
which I wasn't supposed to have just

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,719
against the rules and I knew it it was

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,760
dishonest but I had these notes under

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,840
there and every now and then when I was

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,719
struggling with a question I would

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,800
consult these equations and I would

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,920
proceed I would try to answer the

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,680
questions based on my my hidden

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,000
notes and I was doing that and out the

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,320
corner of my left eye I see footsteps I

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
I hear a little bit of footsteps and I

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,840
see

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,479
like her shoes I see her shoes and I

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,000
freeze I try to play it cool it's like

29
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,880
you know I'm not I'm not going to expose

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,680
myself I'm going to try to play it cool

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
maybe she didn't see me I shouldn't

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,280
overreact and I slide the hidden notes

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,920
under my sheets and act as though

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,600
nothing happened she gets closer I still

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,159
try to play cool but at this point my

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,320
heart's freaking beating right I'm my

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,280
heart's beating so at that point I know

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,439
the game's up but I still try to play

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,920
cool and but she's like right right to

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,720
my left she's right here she's looking

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,399
at me and I act as though you know

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
nothing nothing's going on I'm just an

43
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,399
honest student doing my my work why is

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,960
she disturbing me she says would you

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,960
please lift up your answer sheets and I

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,479
do and my notes are right there I got

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,479
caught

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,320
red-handed she takes the notes says

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,119
continue on your exam and walks away and

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,840
the next 1 hour were a blur you know my

51
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:09,039
heart was pounding I was completely

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,560
reflexive I wasn't a very bad mental

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,720
state because I believed that I would

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,800
get expelled because I did get caught

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,760
red-handed and the policy for dishonesty

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,080
in examinations is ex uh expulsion from

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,080
the

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,800
University but it didn't quite hit me

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
then you know I I did my best I

60
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,120
completed the exam I submitted the paper

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,440
I left and then it hit me I was like

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,160

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,879
my parents spent almost $90,000 over the

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,360
period of two years almost 100K of their

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,360
life savings basically so my parents of

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
course they are from India they sold

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
their property let me close

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,239
this they sold their property to be able

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,560
to fund my

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,319
college experience and I had blown it

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,200
right I not only I didn't fail out I

72
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,400
literally got kicked out for dishonesty

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,360
which is the worst so I didn't get

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,959
kicked out at this point I I thought I

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
would so I thought I was going to get

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,120
kicked out and you know that was the

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,120
probably the most depressed I've ever

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,480
been in my life cuz I had essentially

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,440
betrayed my parents' trust in me I could

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,480
visualize my

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,040
mother's sadness and disappointment my

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,319
father's anger and resentment and that's

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,440
not something I could face up to and to

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,560
this day like when I think about that

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,840
it's like godamn I was in a bad place

86
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,519
right but yeah man

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,920
so I mean at this point might seem like

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,200
a simple thing but actually that's not

89
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,400
even true even now that pain is still

90
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,480
there I thought I had wasted

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,599
$100,000 of my parents hard-earned

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,079
income which they literally sold a

93
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,079
property for to be able to finance my

94
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,640
college so it wasn't about the cheating

95
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,439
it's about betrayal of the

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,000
parents

97
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,959
but you know I was in a bad place I

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,360
never got close cl to you know you know

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,640
that but if I ever got close to it it

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,920
was on that day but I received an email

101
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,000
from that Professor saying you know

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
visit me in my office at so and so time

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,840
the next day it's like okay fine let me

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
do this let me see what happens and I

105
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,919
can proceed based on what happens so I

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,680
go to her office let's call her Dr

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,720
s she's talking to a different student

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,560
and that student walks out I knock at

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,919
the door she sees who it is gets me in

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,360
and on her desk was the notes that I use

111
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,280
like the the evidence basically that I

112
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,400
cheated was right there you know there's

113
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,160
no denying it there's nothing I could do

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,320
she had the proof it was in my

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,680
handwriting so there was no backing out

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,160
there was no it was straight up like hey

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,880
yeah I I cheated you know I I broke the

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,800
rules and the consequence for that was

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,960
exposion I knew that I knew the

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
consequence it's like okay you know I'm

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,199
going to face this like a man

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,680
let's go and talk this with the

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,280
professor let's see what happens

124
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,880
and it was bad for her too because she

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,360
was a new professor she was new to the

126
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
job she didn't know what she was doing

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
and she didn't want to have this extra

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
burden of a disciplinary action against

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,639
a student she didn't want it I didn't

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,039
want it we were both in this terrible

131
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,639
situation which I had put us into and

132
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,840
she looks at me and she says why you

133
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
know why do this you could have asked me

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,720
for help before the exam I would have

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,120
gladly given it like yeah she probably

136
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
would

137
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,360
have and she asked me did I cheat on the

138
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,080
midterms like yeah I cheated on the

139
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,919
midterms as well and I was I was honest

140
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,080
I didn't lie I cheated both on both

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,199
exams I cheated on the homework too but

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,440
she didn't ask that question so I let it

143
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,319
pass then she's like yeah I'm going to

144
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,800
have to I'm going to have to show this

145
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,319
to the disciplinary committee or the

146
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Ethics Committee whatever it's called

147
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,199
it's like yeah I'm aware of this and

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,240
there's nothing to be said she has to do

149
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,639
what she has to do according to the

150
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,199
protocol she has to show it to the

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
Ethics Committee and the ethics

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,160
committee decides what disciplinary

153
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,639
reaction to take it's like okay fine

154
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,919
it's in their it's in their hands I was

155
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,160
like okay I get up to leave I'm leaving

156
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,360
out the door just about to leave I

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,240
almost closed the door she said she says

158
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,479
wait calls me by name calls me back in

159
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,520
and she says the words which I will

160
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,840
remember forever she

161
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,479
says you know I've decided to handle

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,120
this

163
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,120
internally and I just felt the weight

164
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,960
get off my shoulders man because that's

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,000
basically the code word for saying I'm

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,880
going to throw these notes in the trash

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,639
I'm going to forget this ever happened

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,960
go about your day it's like holy

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,080
this is the best possible outcome this

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
is the best possible outcome she said I

171
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,360
that she would give me a D she' give me

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,120
a zero on the exam I was like okay no

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,039
 problem give me a zero that's

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,000
fine just let me out of here don't tell

175
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,759
the disciplinary Committee just I'm done

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,400
you know so I passed that course a d is

177
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:05,319
not a fail an F is a fail a d is a is a

178
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,319
pass so I got a D in thermodynamics 1

179
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,960
and I passed I was done thermodynamics 1

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,160
was done I didn't need to do it

181
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,160
again but next semester was

182
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,599
thermodynamics 2 and I was not going to

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,160
put myself in the same position as I did

184
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,120
in thermodynamics 1 hell no Thermo one I

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,000
was sucking man I was I hated it I was

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,120
not good at it I didn't know how to

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,280
learn and that was the thing I realized

188
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,039
that I didn't know how to learn until

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,759
that point I could just use you know my

190
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,560
brain power I guess to just grind it out

191
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,039
do the repetitions and get good at

192
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,440
whatever subject I was trying to handle

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,400
calc 1 calc 2 whatever it was it was

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,919
only when I hit theramic one as at the

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,240
limit of my brain's power so that's why

196
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,879
I ended up cheating that's why this

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,400
entire episode happened so

198
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,840
thermodynamics 2 is a more difficult

199
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,879
course than thermodynamics 1 so I was

200
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,080
like yeah I I'm going to end up in the

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,919
same exact exact position if I don't

202
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,879
learn how to learn so between the two

203
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,159
semesters there's a few weeks of no

204
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,280
classes I'm going to use that time to

205
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,240
understand how to optimize the

206
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,879
performance of my brain and how to

207
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,479
really have a system for mastering

208
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,039
anything no matter how difficult

209
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,759
including thermodynamics 2 and that's

210
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,280
the system which I'm going to impart to

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,720
you today it's the magic hourglass

212
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,360
method and this is a actual lecture so

213
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm going to use an actual whiteboard I

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,080
have my markers and everything and I'm

215
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,279
going to teach you the method which made

216
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,159
me immensely

217
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:44,000
successful in a even more difficult

218
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,200
topic than Thermo one so what's the

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,600
what's a magic hourglass good question

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,839
let me draw one out so let's

221
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,640
see

222
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,399
that's what an hourglass looks like

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,920
hopefully the wind isn't making my voice

224
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,360
too hard to comprehend that's an

225
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,120
hourglass yeah an hourglass has

226
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,079
sand and that sand is going to trickle

227
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,640
down and you have more

228
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:17,760
sand a magic hourglass is when you put

229
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,040
sand on the top glass of The Hourglass

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,000
and when it trickles down something

231
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:27,480
happens at this point to turn this into

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,519
gold so you have g o l d gold dust the

233
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,519
magic hourglass is an ancient technology

234
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:37,640
of esoteric or Origins and Arcane

235
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,079
transmutative power this device is now

236
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,640
in the lost city of Atlantis and I'm

237
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,519
going to bring this technology to you

238
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,519
today so what's going on in the magic

239
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,519
hourglass and what does it have to do

240
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,959
with learning all right I will explain

241
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,480
the theory behind this at this time so

242
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:58,360
first you have the input that's the sand

243
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,760
you're inputting information into your

244
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,000
brain which you're trying to master and

245
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,000
here the first point under

246
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,519
input

247
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,640
is take breaks so let me explain more I

248
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,800
realized that my biggest downfall when

249
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,800
it came to learning any subject was I

250
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,279
would try to cram because cramming is

251
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,760
the technique all right it's the

252
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,519
technique which they teach in schools in

253
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,959
India and that's where I did middle

254
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,079
school high school so cramming is the

255
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,160
only technique I knew so the idea of

256
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,000
studying was basically if you haven't

257
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,160
examine let's say thermodynamics grab

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,880
the textbook start doing problem after

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,360
problem again and again and again and

260
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,959
again just cram cram cram for like week

261
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,680
straight and then you hit the exam

262
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,360
doesn't work doesn't work it's not ideal

263
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,360
because studying or learning something

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,800
is not like going to the gym when you go

265
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,760
to the gym you want to push through the

266
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,519
last few reps with all your willpower

267
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,560
because that's where the gains are when

268
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,800
it comes to learning it's not like that

269
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,760
learning is not forced learning is

270
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
receptive so when you are trying to

271
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,040
learn something you're going to force it

272
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,959
into your brain man what you got to do

273
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,720
is it's like filling a glass with

274
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,639
Coca-Cola if you try to just glug the

275
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,360
entire Bottle Into Your Glass what's

276
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,279
going to happen is the Fizz is going to

277
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,480
rise it's going to overflow and when the

278
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,040
Fizz dies down you're not even going to

279
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,519
be left with that much liquid that not

280
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,800
much Coca-Cola

281
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,839
so what do you actually do what you need

282
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,720
to do is pour a bit by bit you're going

283
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,800
to pour a little bit allow the fist to

284
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,800
rise let the fist settle down pour a

285
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,399
little bit more allow the fist to rise

286
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,360
let it settle down and then pour some

287
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
more you do it piece by piece cuz you

288
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,440
need the liquid to settle that's how

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,920
Learning Happens so when you're studying

290
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
or learning something take breaks as

291
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,519
often as your brain tells you to with

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
time you'll get better and you'll need

293
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,639
fewer braks but when you're starting out

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,079
your brain is going to get tired it's

295
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,160
going to get Bor is going to get anxious

296
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,360
and it's going to tell you to stop take

297
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,519
that queue stop learning step away from

298
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,920
your desk and here's the trick you do

299
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,800
not consume any other input nor do you

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,680
distract yourself with any kind of

301
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,720
stimulation all right so you're studying

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,880
let's say you're studying calculus

303
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,920
you're studying mathematics whatever it

304
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,839
is you get bored you hit a problem that

305
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,720
you can't solve you'll leave the desk

306
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,639
and you do nothing you do not get on

307
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,120
your phone you do not get on YouTube you

308
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,040
do not watch Netflix you do not play

309
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,720
video games you don't even check

310
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,079
Instagram you don't even check your text

311
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,959
messages you do not distruct yourself by

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,480
doing so-called productive activities

313
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,160
such as cleaning your room cooking food

314
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,800
nothing your only allowed activity is

315
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,360
walking you can walk outside you can

316
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
walk inside your house I don't care you

317
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,160
are not stimulating yourself and you're

318
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,480
not giving further input because that's

319
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,480
what allows the brain that time to

320
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,760
settle that information and actually

321
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,000
absorb absorb and distill and you know

322
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,320
synthesize it into its brain so that's

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,480
how you do good

324
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:16,040
input now here this magic magic location

325
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,959
in the magic hourglass is called

326
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,079
transmutation

327
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,600
trans

328
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:27,760
mutation transmutation is the magic of

329
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,480
taking sand into gold and in

330
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,240
transmutation have a couple pointers for

331
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,880
you the first one is passive and it's

332
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,160
sleep so they did an experiment with

333
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,760
mice they took a bunch of mice and put

334
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,000
them through a maze which they like to

335
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,560
do the scientists and they put probes in

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,639
its brain to measure its electrical

337
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,399
signals and they measured it while it

338
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,560
was solving the maze they made it Mouse

339
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,600
solve the maze like 10 times in a day

340
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,759
and they got the data and they let the

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,519
mouse sleep and they looking at the data

342
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,800
when it slept they're looking at its

343
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,240
Dreams they're looking at what happened

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,839
happens when it has REM sleep so what

345
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,320
they found was when the mouse was

346
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,360
sleeping it was solving the maze so the

347
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,079
same exact electrical signals while it

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,399
was solving the maze were recurring when

349
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,360
the mouse was dreaming so the mouse was

350
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,160
actually replaying that maze in its head

351
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,920
but here's the thing it's doing it 100x

352
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,880
faster if it takes the mouse a minute to

353
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,440
solve the maze in its mind while

354
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,959
dreaming it solving it in 10 seconds 5

355
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,279
Seconds 1 second like really rapidly and

356
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,040
here's the key part it is solving the

357
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,440
maze from you know point A to point B it

358
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,480
is also solving the maze point B to

359
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,120
point a it is also solving the maze in

360
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,199
segments and at random order so the mice

361
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
the mouse was solving a a

362
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,399
computationally powerful difficult

363
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,759
problem multiple times in its sleep so

364
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,920
if a mouse can do that imagine what the

365
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,680
human mind can do so you need to

366
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,639
optimize your sleep to get good at

367
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,279
problem solving memory literally

368
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,000
anything cognition based so how do you

369
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,680
optimize sleep I have a whole video on

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,639
sleep optimization I'll link that in the

371
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,079
description or I'll have the end tile

372
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,160
pop up that's the video you need to

373
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,759
master sleep so that's the passive

374
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
technique of transmutation there are two

375
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,240
active techniques which I'm going to

376
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,680
teach you the first the the well second

377
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:30,600
technique for the first active technique

378
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,600
it is called mental rehearsal so mental

379
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,480
rehearsal mental rehearsal is literally

380
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,440
what I did to do this lecture think

381
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
about this I'm giving a full lecture I'm

382
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,000
barely Consulting my notes how is that

383
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,600
possible it's because I've done it two

384
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,680
times already in my mind so they had an

385
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,480
experiment they did an experiment with

386
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,120
dart players you know what's darts right

387
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,000
they have a it's like a game you play in

388
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,240
I imagine it as being played in like old

389
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,759
timey British bars like you have this

390
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,079
circle that's the goal you have darts

391
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,800
you got to throw it and the closer you

392
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,480
get to the the center of it that's the

393
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,120
higher points you get I've never played

394
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,040
darts but I know what it looks like

395
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:15,120
so they had three groups let's call them

396
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,160
group a b and c group a was not given

397
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,759
any chance to practice all right and

398
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,399
they took the score like they took the

399
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,560
score of what groups A's performance was

400
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,959
at this game of darts Group B got the

401
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,160
chance to practice they practiced and

402
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,120
then they took the score

403
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,680
Group C was told hey you can't actually

404
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,959
practice what you can do is Imagine This

405
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,440
is a dart imagine a dart and imagine the

406
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,839
muscular sequence it takes to launch a

407
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,519
dart now like I don't know how to play

408
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,519
darts but I imagine if I was in that

409
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,480
group if I was in group C I'd imagine

410
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,079
holding a dart visualizing the center of

411
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,120
the target you know holding my dart back

412
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,839
kind of making an eye connection and

413
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,680
then launching it that's how I would

414
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,720
imagine it and these guys did something

415
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,680
similar they tried mental repetitions

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,679
now who do you think they did the best

417
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,039
if hopefully okay so this live stream

418
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,480
was I didn't know how to start

419
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,600
the live stream so hopefully it's going

420
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,039
on right now if you think group a one

421
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,720
type A if you think it's B type B if

422
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,120
it's C type

423
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,799
c so to nobody's surprise Group B did

424
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,880
the best because Group B got to practice

425
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,480
no no surprise there and of course group

426
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
a did the worst cuz they got zero

427
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
practice whatsoever the surprising

428
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,200
finding was Group C which didn't

429
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,200
actually practice all they did was

430
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,400
mentally visualize the practice they

431
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,720
came pretty damn close like they were

432
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,400
didn't beat the group which practiced

433
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,280
but they got close like how how all they

434
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,600
did was practice in the mind but this is

435
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,600
actually a Time tested technique in many

436
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,200
sports especially tennis and golf what

437
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,120
the coaches found was a combination of

438
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,200
actual physical practice plus mental

439
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,360
rehearsals equals greater than just

440
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,919
mental practice or just physical

441
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,320
practice that's mental rehearsals so you

442
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,720
might think well I'm not playing golf

443
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,440
I'm not playing tennis I'm not playing

444
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,000
darts how is it relevant to me you can

445
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,159
do mental rehearsals for anything you

446
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,679
just have to be a bit creative I did

447
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,600
mental rehearsals for this lecture I

448
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,440
want to have you know a a Charisma I

449
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,720
want to have a good storytelling ability

450
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,960
I want to have confidence I want to

451
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,640
speak

452
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,600
eloquently I have to practice to do that

453
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,280
but I can't I didn't the best way to

454
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,000
practice that without actually doing it

455
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,760
is in the mind I practiced this before I

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,360
came here in the mind before I slept it

457
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,919
was encoded I dreamt about it I had done

458
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,480
this 100 times before I'm doing it

459
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,640
because I did it in my R sleep right so

460
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,679
at this point I have I have the best

461
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
amount of camera presence I can muster

462
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,640
at this time because I've done the

463
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,360
repetitions while I was

464
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,039
sleeping that is the power of mental

465
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,240
rehearsal I'll tell you something funny

466
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,720
so I had all the notes for this lecture

467
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,039
prepared and printed out and I left it

468
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,600
in my desk at home I forgot to bring it

469
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,159
so I set up my setup and everything I

470
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,919
have my camera like my phone I have my

471
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,120
whiteboard all that I didn't have my

472
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:22,039
notes so 10 minutes before this lecture

473
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,600
I recreated 100% of my notes word for

474
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:29,039
word in this gym notebook which I have I

475
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:33,440
will actually show it to you I created

476
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,640
two pages words of notes from my memory

477
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,760
alone that's the power of mental

478
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,200
rehearsal you can do this for any

479
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,679
subject if you're trying to get good at

480
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,799
mathematics here's what you do you

481
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,600
imagine the the version of yourself

482
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,640
which is good at mathematics all

483
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,760
right you imagine the version which has

484
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,120
already succeeded at learning calculus

485
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,360
so you're not necessarily trying to

486
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,480
solve the problem in your mind though

487
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,640
you can do that what you're doing is

488
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,159
you're visualizing the that version

489
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,240
which has succeeded and when he sees a

490
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,679
mathematical problem he's like ah okay

491
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,280
so that's how you do this starts writing

492
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,200
the answer you know you can hear the

493
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,400
scratching of his pencil on the on the

494
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
surface you can feel him arriving at the

495
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
conclusions faster than he's able to

496
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,919
write it down that's the visualization

497
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,960
you're going for and this is true for

498
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,360
mathematics maybe you're trying to learn

499
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,120
biology maybe you're trying to learn

500
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,320
mitosis and meosis cool you're imagining

501
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,080
a version of yourself who already knows

502
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,720
it he knows the steps of meosis and

503
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,840
mitosis he knows it without any

504
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,760
confusion you're

505
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,840
visualizing that person why I was

506
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,600
reading this book psycho cybernetics and

507
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,960
it makes this point very forcefully that

508
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,480
is your success always lags behind your

509
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,679
mental image of yourself if you believe

510
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
that you're too dumb to solve a

511
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,200
mathematical problem you are not going

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,640
to succeed at cracking it if you feel

513
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,919
that you are your memory is not good

514
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,400
enough to memorize all these anatomical

515
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,320
names names of all the bones in the

516
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,840
human body you're trying to be a doctor

517
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,200
you'll never succeed if on the other

518
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,600
hand you have the image you believe that

519
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,919
you are the kind of person who is

520
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,679
already good at memorization already

521
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,120
good at solving mathematics already good

522
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,400
at engineering then when you start

523
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,120
solving the problem your brain is in a

524
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,720
relaxed state so this is not this is not

525
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,640
manifestation it's not some

526
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,640
girly thing that you think of something

527
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,559
is going to happen no it's very

528
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,520
straightforward a recept cve mind gets

529
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:37,159
better ideas can process thoughts more

530
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:40,480
fluidly a receptive mind is open to put

531
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,440
it metaphysically is open to the word of

532
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,039
God and there is no we don't get good

533
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,760
ideas good ideas come to you you cannot

534
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,799
force good ideas and I think it was n

535
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,320
who said you only should trust the

536
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,520
thoughts and ideas that come to you

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,240
outdoors in the open and you know that's

538
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,000
why I'm

539
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,679
here that is the power of mental

540
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,520
rehearsal but there was another Dart

541
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,200
study another study of throwing darts

542
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,840
and what these guys did they did the

543
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,080
experiment a little bit differently they

544
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,720
had two groups let's call them group a

545
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,760
and Group B group a had a external locus

546
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,039
of control and Group B had an internal

547
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,159
locus of control so I'll explain what

548
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,360
locus of control is shortly what they

549
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,440
found was the guys with the external

550
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,360
locus of

551
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,200
control for them mental rehearsal didn't

552
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,440
work at all they did all the mental

553
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
rehearsal but they didn't see any

554
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Improvement Group B who had an internal

555
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,320
locus of control they got good through

556
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,600
mental rehearsal alone so what's locus

557
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,360
of control we talked about mental

558
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,279
rehearsal locus of control is the idea

559
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,039
of your mind that you have the ability

560
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:57,039
to control your destiny basically you

561
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,880
have control over where your life is

562
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,919
going your surroundings this is the

563
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,679
masculine way to live you have an

564
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
internal locus of control so locus of

565
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,520
control is basically who do you think

566
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,919
controls your destiny if it's an

567
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,960
internal locus of control it means you

568
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,559
control your destiny people with an

569
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,039
external locus of control basically

570
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,520
believe you know the government is going

571
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,880
to control their Destiny or their

572
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,279
genetics is going to control their

573
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,200
Destiny their parenting their education

574
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,360
their their looks is going to control

575
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,360
their Destiny internal locus of control

576
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,880
which is what I have I believe I am in

577
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,120
charge I am in charge of the course of

578
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,200
my life whether it goes to or I

579
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,240
become something great it's on me I have

580
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,960
internal locus of control it's me I

581
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,240
believe that duty is Destiny this is the

582
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,520
lesson of the bhagwad Gita which is an

583
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,960
ancient religious text duty is Destiny

584
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,760
you perform the duty that is given to

585
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
you again and again with the highest

586
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,400
caliber of performance and Destiny takes

587
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,159
care of itself in other words I want you

588
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,480
to listen to this and then repeat it in

589
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,360
your mind as a form of mental

590
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,440
rehearsal your thoughts and actions

591
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,400
shape your character character is who

592
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,679
you are and the character shapes your

593
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,120
destiny so say it with me in your mind

594
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:21,960
thoughts and actions shape

595
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,720
character character shapes Destiny

596
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,480
that's going to give you an internal

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,679
locus of control which is point number

598
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,840
three I'm just going to say I internal

599
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,679
locus of control ilc if you have these

600
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,799
three you are trans mutating you're

601
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,440
transforming what you learn into

602
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,640
something greater into

603
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,919
output so you might have heard of

604
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,559
definement technique all these you know

605
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,159
Ali abdal types they always talk about

606
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,960
finement technique you know finement

607
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,520
technique is nothing it's just if you

608
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,679
teach something you're going to get

609
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,320
better at it so if you're trying to

610
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,760
master calculus you grab a friend teach

611
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
him the problem that you learn learned

612
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,320
and as he asks questions and you

613
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,440
interact you get damn good at that

614
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,200
subject cool the thing is most of us

615
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,159
don't have very good friend circles or

616
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,760
we don't even have friends or

617
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,760
your friends are not interested in the

618
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,799
same things that you're interested in or

619
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,000
are in different subjects than you so

620
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,240
may not be possible and also maybe you

621
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,880
don't really want to talk about like

622
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,960
academics with your friends it's fine

623
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,080
what you do instead is you make a

624
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,840
YouTube

625
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,720
series what you do is say you're trying

626
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,120
to learn calculus become a con Academy

627
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,039
onto yourself start posting on YouTube

628
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,720
get a whiteboard like this one be like

629
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:41,039
hey you know calculus first concept of

630
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,480
calculus differentiation this is what

631
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,320
differentiation is or integrals this is

632
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,159
what integrals is make video after video

633
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,679
explaining the stuff as you learn cuz

634
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,720
when you're making a video about

635
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,240
something you have to transmute it you

636
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,200
have to synthesize it you have to

637
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,360
simplify it so your audience understands

638
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,039
you have to make it come to life so your

639
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,720
audience understands you don't need an

640
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,960
audience on YouTube you can post stuff

641
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
for free maybe nobody watches them but

642
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,399
who cares you've improved your public

643
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,679
speaking you've improved your presence

644
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,159
you've actually Gotten Good at that

645
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,600
subject and I know this to be true so

646
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,000
nutrition I'm very passionate about

647
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,760
nutrition I have a lot of knowledge

648
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,679
about nutrition I learned a lot of

649
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,000
nutrition to make these videos but it is

650
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,000
only when I made my nutrition course

651
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,559
that I reach a new level of confidence

652
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,640
and competent

653
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,039
at this

654
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,799
topic when I made the course I made like

655
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:37,720
40 modules of nutrition topics I had to

656
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:40,159
figure out you know how does this module

657
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,200
fit in the section how do the sections

658
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,039
fit into this course Etc in doing that

659
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,760
not only did I learn more also the

660
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,840
thoughts which I already had in my head

661
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,880
were arranged it was it's like taking a

662
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,399
Rubik's Cube and solving it I had this

663
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,039
unsolved Rubik's cube of nutrition facts

664
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,399
and as I created the course I was

665
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,919
solving it and at the end I kind of

666
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,760
understood nutrition I was like you know

667
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,120
if somebody ask me to give a lecture on

668
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
nutrition like that I could probably do

669
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,200
it I could probably do a damn good job

670
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,799
of it and I was confident and competent

671
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,320
at that topic of nutrition because I had

672
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,080
made a course on it now you don't have

673
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,720
to make a whole ass course but if you do

674
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,120
you will master that topic guaranteed

675
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,600
that is output make a YouTube

676
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,600
series so you're harnessing the power of

677
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,840
YouTube for learning not by watching

678
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,600
videos but by making them by being in

679
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:38,080
the Creator's seat and that's how the

680
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:42,000
magic hourglass method works and I use

681
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,760
this man I use this very method to

682
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,440
master to get really good as at

683
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,960
thermodynamics 2 so Thermo 2 is a more

684
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,320
difficult topic and was by a different

685
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,080
Professor you know Dr s who I shall not

686
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,760
mention her name she's out of the

687
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,320
picture she's done that Thermo one

688
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,080
Thermo 2 was another professor his name

689
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,159
was

690
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,360
Campanella and he was a master of

691
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,919
thermodynamics he was a seven or eight

692
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,320
figure entrepreneur in Agri business and

693
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,480
he loved thermodynamics so much that

694
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,120
when he retired he's like can I teach at

695
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,320
University and he was teaching this high

696
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,480
level thermodynamics class and of course

697
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,120
he was a master in his field right of

698
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,559
course he was he was a professor in one

699
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,200
of the best engineering

700
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,039
colleges probably on the

701
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,600
planet and there was one problem he was

702
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,760
solving and the problem was about pipes

703
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,039
and how heat escapes from pipes which is

704
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,000
a common thermodynamics

705
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,640
problem and it was a difficult problem

706
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,039
and it's actually a very interesting

707
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,240
thing so as you increase the insulation

708
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,960
on a pipe when you go from zero to a

709
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,039
little bit of insulation actually the

710
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,600
heat which escapes increases and then it

711
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,440
starts to decrease again as you increase

712
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,919
the insulation so I don't need to

713
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,840
explain thermodynamics on this lecture

714
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,080
right but basically it was a complicated

715
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,519
simulation and complicated mathematical

716
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,360
equations which which go with it and he

717
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,559
was solving it on the board and at this

718
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,120
time I was I was pretty good like that's

719
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,880
pretty good at thermodynamics I was like

720
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,919
you know this doesn't make intuitive

721
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,399
sense to me and my mathematics is

722
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,080
looking a little bit different from what

723
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,559
was on the board so after the class I

724
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,840
was like hey professor you know I don't

725
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,120
think this is like I my intuition is

726
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,080
telling me that my solution is correct

727
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,080
and he looks over my solution it says

728
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,640
you got to come to my office at 6:00

729
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,919
p.m. later today it's like okay you know

730
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,000
I I knew I didn't do anything wrong so I

731
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,240
was like I'll go to his office I went to

732
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,559
his office and this was a parallel to my

733
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,080
office visit to Dr s in thermal

734
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:44,399
one so same building right same floor

735
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,960
even but this time I had solved

736
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,919
something I went in and by the time it

737
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,720
was 6:00 I had run some more simulations

738
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,279
I was getting even more confident of my

739
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,159
solution to the problem like hey

740
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,120
professor like I know I'm right I ran

741
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,519
the solution through Wolfram Alpha which

742
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,000
is like um computational software it's

743
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:01,240
like this is the graphs which came out

744
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,320
and everything all right so Professor

745
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,159
sees it he's like yeah I know cuz I did

746
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,399
the same thing and he's like I've been

747
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,279
teaching this problem wrong for 5 years

748
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,080
and nobody's corrected

749
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,919
me you are really good at your

750
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,600
intuition and you know I was feeling

751
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,440
really proud of myself and he says he

752
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,559
says when you're looking for a letter of

753
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,360
recommendation you come to

754
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,399
me you have to understand professors

755
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,679
don't hand out letters of recommendation

756
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,240
students have to kind of like beg for

757
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,799
them have just scrun around for

758
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,720
professors who are willing to write you

759
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,760
a letter of recommendation and this

760
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,000
professor one of the best in his field

761
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,519
offered it to me it was a a true honor a

762
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,600
true highlight of my academic career as

763
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,679
it

764
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,799
was and of course I took him up on the

765
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,559
offer I got into grad school because of

766
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,559
this

767
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,880
experience and that was through the

768
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,919
power of this very technique which I've

769
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,120
given you

770
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,240
and you know I wish I could just end off

771
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,880
at a high note I had done the technique

772
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,799
and I had succeeded guys you know listen

773
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,679
to my technique cuz I succeeded it

774
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,679
wasn't like that man so I got good at

775
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,760
thermodynamics I used the same method on

776
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,320
other topics I got good like I got good

777
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,799
grades for the first time in engineering

778
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,960
I succeeded I graduated with pretty

779
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,480
decent grade I was

780
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,039
okay and graduation was the worst day of

781
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,519
my life even thinking back about it now

782
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,000
it's like God damn that was a bad day I

783
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,240
made my mother cry during the day of

784
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,960
graduation so the reason why I was so

785
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,039
upset and depressed when I got caught

786
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,480
cheating was because I thought I

787
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,880
betrayed my parents and I wasted their

788
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,159
money their hard earned income because I

789
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,639
was no good at engineering so I

790
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,360
believed after I actually completed my

791
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,200
engineering degree it dawned on me that

792
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,000
I'd have to get an engineering job at

793
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,440
this point and I didn't actually enjoy

794
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,120
mathematics and

795
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,519
Engineering now I had spent almost $200

796
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,519
,000 of my parents money instead of the

797
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,000
100,000 in thermo one I finished my

798
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,200
degree right I spent $200,000 of my

799
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,840
parents money probably even more because

800
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I didn't even factor in like you know

801
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,159
room and board right so I was like God I

802
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,760
spent so much of your money but I don't

803
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,720
actually want to get the engineering job

804
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,519
that this degree allows me to get what

805
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,559
do I do I wanted to study biology I want

806
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,559
to study science and that's not exactly

807
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,799
high

808
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,519
paying engineering is super high paying

809
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,120
but science really isn't so I was like

810
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,880
 hell I got this degree I did so

811
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,360
much hard work and I still ended up

812
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,639
betraying my parents because my parents

813
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,799
vision for me was not going to get

814
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:43,080
filled and I was very rude I was very

815
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,080
upset I was very angry at myself and I

816
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,720
let that affect my parents I was very

817
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,480
rude I was brusk I didn't thank them for

818
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,159
their support over the past four years

819
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,480
and I literally made my mother cry

820
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,120
because I couldn't control my own

821
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,679
emotions I wasn't in I I wasn't taking

822
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,279
charge of my own actions and my own

823
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,480
destiny so I've completed my engineering

824
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,279
degree and the Learning lesson here is

825
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,440
that you can use this technique to get

826
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,840
good at anything but you shouldn't get

827
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,919
good at anything you should get good at

828
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,720
the thing which matters to you don't use

829
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,120
this technique to get good at

830
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,240
thermodynamics if you don't enjoy

831
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,519
thermodynamics don't get good

832
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,840
at soccer if you don't even enjoy soccer

833
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,039
don't get

834
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,440
good at copyrighting if you don't even

835
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,039
enjoy writing don't get good at the

836
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,279
guitar if you don't enjoy music you have

837
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,320
a finite amount of time in life if all

838
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,399
you're doing

839
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,880
is learning and educating and studying

840
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:52,279
to impress your parents then you are a

841
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,080
 dork I was a dork so not anymore

842
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:56,440
 that now I do things for myself if

843
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,039
you're doing things just to impress your

844
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,519
parents you you are a dork if you're

845
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,440
doing things just for money you are a

846
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,279
nerd if all you're doing is you're

847
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,120
learning coding and computational skills

848
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,800
because you want to work for Microsoft

849
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,760
you don't actually care about coding all

850
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,960
you want to do is get the highp Ping job

851
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,800
you are a nerd do not study to

852
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:20,399
impress your parents do not study to get

853
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,480
money study learn and educate yourself

854
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:28,079
because it is a Divine Duty learning you

855
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,280
have to understand that tightens off our

856
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:37,440
civilization our kedes our Aristotle

857
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:41,079
tmy Socrates arabat all these Newton

858
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,240
galwa gaus all these guys they learned

859
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,119
educated themselves and practiced in

860
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:49,119
order to expand their minds the same as

861
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,399
going to the gym it's same as practicing

862
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,000
combat Arts they were practicing the

863
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:57,079
talents of their

864
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,880
mind gaus I think it was who said I get

865
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,599
it now have to really get it what he was

866
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,160
talking about

867
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:10,119
was the power of intuition and divine

868
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,640
reception so once you make up your mind

869
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,760
you have a why on why you want to learn

870
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,560
something you want to master

871
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,040
thermodynamics because you want to

872
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,920
create food preservation systems which

873
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,440
will save people's lives all right

874
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,040
that's a good why learning learning

875
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,599
thermodynamics to impress your parents

876
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,400
that's not a good why so let's say you

877
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:36,160
have the why that point learning is not

878
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,320
a matter of any of these things it's

879
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,599
divine the heavens will give you divine

880
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,839
inspiration on how to get good at stuff

881
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,680
ideas will come to you so going back to

882
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:49,520
gaus and his quote gaus was a

883
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
mathematician par Excellence right he

884
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,520
was a master

885
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,200
mathematician he saw a mathematical

886
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
problem and his intuition gave him the

887
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,960
solution he knew the solution to his

888
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,480
mathematical problem but he didn't know

889
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,400
the steps to get there so he said I get

890
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,160
it I see the solution but now I have to

891
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,520
get it cuz he has to prove his solutions

892
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,200
to his mathematical buddies right that

893
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,040
is the metaphysical and a Divine aspect

894
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,800
of learning and of course the opposite

895
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,960
to that is the Divine aspect of teaching

896
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I do not consider these lectures to be a

897
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,000
way to get money I mean of course I will

898
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,760
but there's something else going on

899
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,040
right it goes deeper the act of learning

900
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:37,680
creating transmutation and teaching

901
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:40,160
which is output has a metaphysical and

902
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,000
divine how would you say

903
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,480
it purpose the purpose is a weak word

904
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,640
let's go for a stronger word Duty it has

905
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,280
Duty and of course I said duty is

906
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,800
Destiny so that's why I'm here that's

907
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,680
why I'm doing this lecture I have a

908
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,119
Divine duty to teach you the things that

909
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,160
I know I have a Divine duty to teach you

910
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,200
everything that I

911
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,319
know a lot of people think that my

912
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,520
channel is a health education

913
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,920
self-improvement Channel which I guess

914
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,599
it some sometimes is it's not the end

915
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,880
goal never

916
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,599
was I was working for Hamza as you know

917
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,599
this was this was years ago Hamza is a

918
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,119
world-class Storyteller and expert

919
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,440
YouTuber

920
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,119
and when I was working with him I

921
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,560
realized that I was older than him I had

922
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,880
an engineering job at the time so this

923
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,319
was after my undergrad I had an

924
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,400
engineering job which is making Fair bit

925
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,000
of money I realized Hamza is not

926
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,160
necessarily more talented or more

927
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,720
educated or smarter than me yet he was

928
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,079
making 10x the money I was making and

929
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,640
this because he was living to his

930
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,119
purpose he was living according to his

931
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,480
mission and I had a mission too and

932
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,640
because I wasn't living to that mission

933
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,800
I wasn't making half the money he was

934
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,119
making so so that's why I started the

935
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,680
YouTube channel is the mission I had was

936
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,160
more important than hamza's what's the

937
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:09,960
mission it's not heal the mission has to

938
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,480
do with two axioms the first axom is

939
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,200
that all governments tend to tyranny

940
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,560
there's been zero exceptions to this

941
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,680
rule throughout history you will see

942
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,160
that every single government always

943
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,520
tends to become tyrannical with time

944
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,119
this is an ironclad rule of History the

945
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,359
second axom is that for the next 10

946
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,920
years next 20 years technology is going

947
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,079
to improve so how do these two combine

948
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,440
it's because in the past when you had

949
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,520
Stalin and Hitler these tyrants these

950
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,680
tyrants wanted total to sorry

951
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,560
totalitarian control over you they want

952
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,680
to control every aspect of your life but

953
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,640
they couldn't do it they couldn't do it

954
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,079
because they didn't have the technology

955
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,599
to do it they didn't have the

956
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,720
technology so even though they wanted to

957
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,960
know your thoughts they wanted to know

958
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,200
your actions they wanted to know your

959
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,760
worldview they wanted to know what you

960
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,760
read what you ate everything they

961
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,240
couldn't do it if you're in you know

962
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,720
 nowhere Russia Stalin is not

963
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,000
going to be able to enforce his will on

964
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,760
you he couldn't do it even if he wanted

965
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,839
to but if you look at the social credit

966
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,119
system in

967
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:19,040
China at this point in history because

968
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,760
of the technology that we have including

969
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,839
artificial intelligence governments can

970
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,400
actually monitor you in real time every

971
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,640
day till the day you die from the from

972
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,280
the time you born it's going to

973
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:38,079
happen I Rebel at this the thought of it

974
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,640
makes my skin crawl I have to do

975
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,480
something against it when there's still

976
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,599
time what I'm going to do is create a

977
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,880
parallel Society a society a group of

978
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,560
indiv a group of men and women who think

979
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,319
of Health Care and education differently

980
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,160
that is what I want to establish I want

981
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:58,359
to

982
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,079
create that is why I do what I do that's

983
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:02,319
the purpose that's what makes this all

984
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,200
worth

985
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:09,200
it

986
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,720
so I I started doing this in my private

987
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,920
