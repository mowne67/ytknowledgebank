1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,199
so who is gay

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,319
[Music]

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,059
first they call them crazy they called

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,519
him a lunatic they called him a liar

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,860
then they called him a racist I transfer

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
a homophobe it's not funny but

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,580
regardless of the other crazy claims

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,480
that he has made over his long career

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,820
the fact is they did turn the frogs game

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,340
and if you're lucky we might be able to

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,160
see a gay frog today the same chemical

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,720
atrazine that turns to Frog's gay well

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,399
it doesn't even just turn them gay it

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,380
actually turns them trans it messes with

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,660
their reproductive organs and mutates

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,420
them and destroys them that same

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,320
chemical atrazine is actually present in

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,899
your drinking water too so get this

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,320
atrazine is actually 100 percent banned

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,079
in the European Union so the EU banned

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,739
it completely but not in the U.S in the

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,780
U.S atrazine is the second most popular

23
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:59,940
herbicide right behind glyphosate which

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,879
is Roundup which is probably just as bad

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,700
as atrazine U.S we don't really care we

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,500
just say [ __ ] it so if you think I'm not

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,060
a frog and I don't care about the

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,880
environment

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,979
well you're a dumbass atrazine is in

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,040
your water supply and it has very

31
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,360
similar effects on humans as it does

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
with frogs

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,460
so they actually did experiments with

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,299
mice embryos and they found that my

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,479
embryos literally die when exposed to

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,119
atrazine and then they did other studies

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,060
with show Hall atrazine affects humans

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,439
and unsurprisingly it's highly toxic to

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,520
us literally atrazine is an estrogen so

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,799
which means

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,860
that it competes

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,439
with testosterone and tanks your

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,659
hormonal Supply and of course you know

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
the testosterone is an important well

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,579
it's the most important

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
hormone for a young man's health

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,899
literally this is what determines your

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,939
mental health it determines your

49
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
motivational levels

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,039
so if you find that you have no energy

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,899
you have no motivation and you have no

52
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,000
discipline it could literally be a

53
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,920
hormonal issue it's not a moral issue

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,480
you know what I mean like it's not

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,940
because you're a bad person or you're a

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,220
lazy person literally you have poisons

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,459
in your water

58
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,959
that are turning you unmotivated and

59
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,120
undisciplined

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
there's no way I think I can make it

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
let's go

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,459
let's go

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,459
this is about to be a challenge

64
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,620
in this self-improvement community on

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,680
YouTube we often talk about things like

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,000
meditation and journaling and all this

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
stuff which is obviously these are good

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,420
habits right

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,819
but making money

70
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,800
Etc always a good habits but

71
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,040
think about it you're literally fighting

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,140
an uphill battle against your body every

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,239
single day as long as you're being

74
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,080
poisoned by these substances in our

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,220
environment so I believe the first step

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:11,459
in self-improvement is actually a detox

77
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:14,760
not a dopamine detox but an actual detox

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,959
removing toxins from your body now

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,540
you're going to think I'm some kind of

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,739
liberal hippie type person it's not the

81
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,860
case

82
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,379
I think America is sadly divided on many

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,040
issues and one of those issues has

84
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,360
become environmental toxins you know and

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,819
this is stupid

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,140
both conservatives and liberals should

87
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,300
agree

88
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,940
that the environment is a critically

89
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,239
important part of our well-being as

90
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,940
humans and we being the stewards of this

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,400
planet have a moral duty

92
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,560
to upkeep our environment and of course

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,260
even if you're being selfish literally

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,299
having a good environment is important

95
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,379
for our own well-being

96
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,379
you think I can make this

97
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,360
I don't think I can make this

98
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm gonna try

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
okay almost there

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
we're gonna go

101
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,799
okay I wasn't in that bad I know I was

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,139
so scared that's crazy so think about it

103
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,820
you're on self-improvement

104
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,459
you're doing all the important things

105
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,959
all the good things meditation Etc but

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,940
you're still not seeing results and

107
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,280
every day is a challenge and there's no

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,960
momentum that's actually not how it

109
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
should be if you think about it

110
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,220
self-improvement

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,259
should be the most natural and easy

112
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,699
thing for a man to do this literally

113
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,380
should be programmed in our genes to

114
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,740
self-improve but it's not the case

115
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,080
because our hormonal systems have been

116
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,139
hijacked by these artificial

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,680
environmental estrogens which literally

118
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,740
destroy our motivation Drive happiness

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,780
our sex drive and our drive to make

120
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,180
money and have success in life

121
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,220
so you might ask well is this scientific

122
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,780
is everything which I'm saying true well

123
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,000
yes and I'll link the studies down below

124
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,400
and it's not a secret scientists have

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,199
been talking about the effects of

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
atrazine and other estrogenics on the

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,979
environment and on the human body for

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,979
quite some time now but we've just

129
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:17,820
decided as a society to ignore

130
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:20,820
the call you know everybody in the

131
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,340
so-called masculinity space they all

132
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,080
talk about how you know civilization is

133
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,900
ending and it's all because of feminism

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,380
or it's all about socialism

135
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,560
etc etc I think this is a mistake I

136
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,120
think the bigger problem which kind of

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,759
goes under the radar

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,180
is literal toxins in our bloodstream

139
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,699
think about it is is an ideology in a

140
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,740
half-baked ideology could have more

141
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,280
impact on our success as a civilization

142
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,560
or actual poison in our bloodstream and

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,479
this reminds me of this one thing I read

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,580
about the Roman Empire as it is

145
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,340
declining there was more and more

146
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,680
instances of people being mad you know

147
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,699
Madness and you would call that mental

148
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,860
illness today you wouldn't call it

149
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,100
Madness today and it was on the rise

150
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,639
because of many reasons but one reason

151
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,600
which historians have come to is because

152
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,280
there was lead in Roman pipes so the

153
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,620
pipes which Romans got their water from

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,060
had lead in it and of course the Romans

155
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,100
didn't know that lead was toxic so they

156
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,020
didn't see the connection between lead

157
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,759
in their pipes and increase in the cases

158
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,840
of Madness and mental illness in their

159
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,880
City

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
so are we in a similar position today

161
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,860
then where we're barely understanding

162
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,600
the effect of microplastics and

163
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,520
environmental estrogens on our

164
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,639
bloodstreams and maybe 100 years from

165
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,319
today we'll look back and think oh these

166
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,479
you know 21st century people they

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,000
they're literally poisoning themselves

168
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,460
and complaining about feminism when the

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Real Enemy was actual toxins in their

170
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,479
environment that's why I really fear

171
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,340
we're missing

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,160
what the real problem in society

173
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,120
actually is is literal poisons

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,060
This Is Where It Starts literally this

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,520
feels where the atrazine comes to so

176
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,919
this is a cornfield slash a soybean

177
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,639
field and there's literally acres and

178
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,639
acres and Acres of soya and corn fields

179
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,080
in the midwest in the USA and also other

180
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,539
places I'm sure

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,060
and it's here that tons and tons of

182
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,360
atrazine is dumped and finds its way

183
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,520
into our water supply and causes the

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,020
feminization of men and you think I

185
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
might be making this phrase up or

186
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,340
there's some kind of manosphere phrase

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,800
not the case the term feminization of

188
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,500
men is a scientific phrase which actual

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,120
scientists use it's a real problem it's

190
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,160
a real phenomenon which is taking place

191
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,020
in our world today and people like to

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
blame Socialism or feminism like I said

193
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,080
but I would put the blame first on

194
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,240
environmental toxins literally found in

195
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
fields such as this

196
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
so the question now is of course what do

197
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,580
you do about it you aren't going to stop

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,979
atrazine use you know people have tried

199
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,960
and failed in places like Europe yes

200
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,880
they have successfully banned it and

201
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,800
have banned it for years but in the US

202
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,560
the I mean it's not like people don't

203
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,319
know about it so understand this this 40

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,319
50 60 studies showing that atrazine is

205
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:20,580
harmful for plants and not not plants

206
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,319
animals and humans Etc but

207
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,419
there's one study

208
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
which actually paints a positive picture

209
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,620
of atrazine says that the estrogenic

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
effects of atrazine are not Direct

211
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,159
and if you look at that one study which

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,700
I'll cite down below you'll find that

213
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,880
that study has been funded by syngenta

214
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,919
that study was funded by syngenta which

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,620
is one of the biggest herbicide

216
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,880
companies on the planet and of course

217
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,980
there's a conflict of interest there

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,899
isn't there so very suspicious that the

219
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,279
one positive study and even that's it's

220
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,560
not actually positive it just says that

221
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,600
the effects are not direct and that

222
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,700
state was funded by literally the

223
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,680
company which makes this stuff so it's

224
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,380
not like scientists and politicians

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,800
don't know that atrazine hurts us

226
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,019
in fact of course U.S lawmakers know

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,540
that European lawmakers ban this stuff

228
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,820
so they know it's harm harmful

229
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,620
just the U.S politicians don't seem to

230
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,720
kill a farm which is a different problem

231
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,120
altogether so it's up to you to take

232
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,640
matters into your own hands what can you

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,760
do about it you need to buy yourself an

234
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
RO water filter so reverse osmosis Ro

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839
you can literally purchase this on

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,160
Amazon and install it yourself or if

237
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,019
you're you know if you have enough money

238
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,940
you can get a really good system and

239
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,620
have it installed in your home in any

240
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,380
case you need some kind of filtration

241
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,140
system in your home to protect yourself

242
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,480
and your family it's not a matter of

243
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,180
opinion you need one and you need it

244
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,220
yesterday or you have an alternative you

245
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,320
can get yourself a water distiller and

246
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,420
distill water in your home and then you

247
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
know

248
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,480
re-mineralize it and then drink it

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
that's also an option I will link down

250
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,200
below I'm not an affiliate or anything I

251
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,940
don't get any money from promoting these

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,800

give you the means I'm going to give you

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,120
the information and then it's up to you

255
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
to act on it and actually protect

256
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,339
yourself from these toxins and that I

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,920
believe is the first step in modern and

258
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,920
21st century self-improvement it's not

259
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,160
meditation it's not mindfulness it's

260
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,779
literally literally saving yourself from

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,440
these toxins which are poisoning your

262
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,600
bloodstream right now

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,320
