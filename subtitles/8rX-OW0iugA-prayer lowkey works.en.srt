1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,080
80% of the people who tried prayer felt

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,879
the power boost so what is this power

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,360
boost actually it's more than one thing

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,320
so let's discuss a few of them the first

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,480
is luck you literally become more lucky

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
and things just start to go your way

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,000
when you engage truthfully in prayer

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,560
this is one of the chief differences

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
between meditation and prayer when you

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,000
start praying for something a solution

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,840
to a problem guidance to make a decision

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,039
or a fresh opportunity to take control

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,160
of your life often times you'll get it

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
some of these experiences be so surreal

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,879
that you never want to share it with

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,399
anybody prayer primes your brain to

17
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,239
detect opportunities and find Solutions

18
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,320
it is literally a strategic asset the

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,520
second Advantage is the aura of command

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,239
consistent prayer gives you this Primark

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,120
Aura basically a Halo of Charisma that

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,559
you never had before this happens

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,120
because you move with a purpose through

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,399
life and people are going to tend to

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,440
notice Goan is the Gloom of nihilism you

26
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,960
are wrapped in this armor of purpose

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
that most people can absolutely detect

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,880
most people will be drawn to it both men

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
and women especially women though

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,200
because they're more perceptive about

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,040
these things I'm not speaking of sexual

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,680
attraction I'm speaking of something

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
different people will trust you more not

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
because you're using some of these

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
Robert Green's disgusting little weasel

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,920
tactics but rather you're genuinely a

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,880
more trustworthy person by the way if

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,040
you've read 48 Laws of Power you need to

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
watch my video on it to understand its

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
weaknesses as well well as its strengths

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,759
you become memorable to the people

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,280
around you because nobody carries thems

43
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,680
with that kind of shity anymore you

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
aren't just thinking about the next exam

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,759
the tax deadline or how to approach this

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,399
damn Starbucks Barista you're thinking

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,719
of higher and greater things the fourth

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,920
Advantage is the death of nihilism

49
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,680
here's a question for you how much light

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,399
does it take to light up a dark room not

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,079
much if you can light up a single candle

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,159
you can pretty much see around you no

53
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,000
matter how much Darkness there is the

54
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,280
smallest flame can still defeat it light

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
has an asymmetric advantage over the

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,200
dark and so it is with hope against

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,200
despair it is impossible to be consumed

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,800
by nihilism when you have a habit of

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,400
daily prayer the fifth Advantage

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,519
resilience prayer builds faith and Faith

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,080
builds resilience sometimes the

62
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,920
situations that we find ourself are so

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,280
miserable that there seems to be no

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
logical reason to continue the struggle

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,599
but there in lies the weakness of logic

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
logic relies on knowledge and knowledge

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,440
is always incomplete or sometimes

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,680
incorrect sometimes you need a reason to

69
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,080
continue the fight that is illogical

70
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,040
that is not based on facts sometimes you

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,200
need faith that it will all work out in

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,000
the end and so it is better to start

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,599
with the habit of prayer before

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,040
circumstances force you to the fifth

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,319
Advantage is physical strength you may

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,319
not believe this until you try this out

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
dedicate the last few reps or even the

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,200
last full set to the heavens and you

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,159
will feel the second win you'll feel the

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
weights becoming lighter and you'll be

81
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,519
able to get more reps in it's kind of

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,480
crazy it's something you can literally

83
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,080
try today to verify that I'm telling the

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,120
truth the sixth Advantage protection

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,480
from addiction most people don't know

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
this but people don't get addicted to

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,840
porn because they're horny or drugs

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
because they need the high rather

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,640
there's a vacuum inside the psyche that

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,159
they're trying to fill you get a massive

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,319
power boost in terms of willpower if you

92
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,799
manage to squeak out a prayer before you

93
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,840
act out your addiction now I ask you a

94
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,200
question have you felt any of these in

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
your life if so tell me in the comments

96
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,840
below because this would be so helpful

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,239
for guys from different perspectives to

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,319
have this discussion as to our personal

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,480
experiences now I know that I've given

100
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,280
you selfish self-centered and practical

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
and materialistic reasons to consider

102
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,959
the act of worship and besides that I'm

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,319
sure many are thinking that these

104
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,519
benefits are nothing but Placebo let me

105
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,519
answer the first objection first first

106
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,079
and here's the reason why I'm doing this

107
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm doing this because the reason you

108
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,599
start is not the reason you stay you

109
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,920
think about going to the gym ideally

110
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,200
You're motivated to go to the gym

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
because of the innate health benefits

112
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,639
however most of us start going to the

113
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,040
gym because we had a bad breakup we were

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,600
bullied in school so we wanted to

115
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,000
toughen up or even the most common one

116
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,360
we just wanted to get laid but once you

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,199
start working out you see benefits that

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,919
you didn't even expect you start

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,759
learning about diet and nutrition and

120
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,759
now you have more energy and focus than

121
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,720
ever before you wanted to get good with

122
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,680
chicks but your new confidence actually

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
gives you more success in business and

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,840
college the reason you start going to

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,440
the gym isn't necessarily the reason you

126
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,960
stay the same journey is true for prayer

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,080
and I know that because I've been on the

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
same road you start doing it for the

129
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,520
power boost but you stay doing it for

130
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,440
higher Reasons I'm going to tell you how

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,880
to reap these rewards and how you can

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,880
get started with time you'll find your

133
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,320
own way you might choose to

134
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,919
wholeheartedly Embrace religion or you

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,600
might not that is a personal choice that

136
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,560
I am not going to try to influence you

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,960
with what I can help you with is just

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,400
getting started the central question of

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,039
this communic is does prayer work and

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,680
the answer is an unchallenged yes from

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,360
every mud hut tribe to the grandest

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,120
civilizations man has ever built if

143
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,800
these folk didn't see a benefit on a

144
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,160
day-to-day basis they would have stopped

145
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,240
wasting their time with this because

146
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,919
after all people in the past had zero

147
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,440
free time but they always made time to

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,479
pray now let's look at a different

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,120
context let's look at physical health

150
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,680
our modern diet is trash and everybody

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,440
kind of knows this but what happens when

152
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,759
you remove the modern ingredients from

153
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,360
our diet like seed oils and replace them

154
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,199
with traditional ingredients like butter

155
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,840
or Tallow we get a power boost let's

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,800
look at hormonal Health as soon as we

157
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,240
get exposure to Daily Sunshine like our

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
ancestors did we get a power boost when

159
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,400
we look at Social Health as soon as we

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
focus on real life interaction over

161
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,600
internet interaction we get a power

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,479
boost the Modern Age We live in is not

163
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,240
inherently bad it's just that we have

164
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,440
divorced ourselves so much from our

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,680
biological and cultural roots that we

166
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,720
start becoming ill health as you know

167
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,560
has five aspects physical hormonal

168
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,360
mental social and spiritual it's a

169
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,639
surprise to nobody that Society is ill

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,599
in all five of these aspects to the

171
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,919
degree that we move away from what our

172
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:30,120
ancestors did we live in a Godless age a

173
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,759
post religion age of nihilism and

174
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,560
direction we live in an age of physical

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,919
hormonal mental and social and spiritual

176
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,479
deine for the first time in human

177
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,680
history we've had the hubris to think

178
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,120
that we are the Masters of the Universe

179
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,919
we think that the scientists in their

180
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,800
lab codes have it all figured out the

181
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,680
funniest part is though that the

182
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,759
greatest scientists of the ages have

183
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,960
believed in God it's wner Heisenberg the

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
father of quantum mechanics who said the

185
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,639
first gulp from the glass of the the

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,639
Natural Sciences will turn you into an

187
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,160
atheist but at the bottom of the glass

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,560
God is waiting for you so what is he

189
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,639
speaking of he's talking about the fact

190
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,479
that when you spend time to learn about

191
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,520
creation it's the same as spending time

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,280
to learn about he who creates in modern

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,520
times our very own Chad neurobiologist

194
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,680
Andrew huberman talks about prayer out

195
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,280
loud every single day he talks about

196
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,039
publicly and openly how his life changed

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,960
when he restarted and embraced his

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,199
childhood practice of prayer this video

199
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,960
is for atheists agnostics pagans

200
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,800
Christians everybody this because I have

201
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,520
no intention of pushing my belief system

202
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,639
on you I have zero authority to tell you

203
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,199
what to believe for most of my adult

204
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,759
life I was an atheist I was an atheist

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,520
because I was logical and skeptical I

206
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,039
wanted to make sense of the universe

207
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,639
without resorting to assumptions and

208
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,479
hand waving I did not accept the idea

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,919
that a holy book could be proof for the

210
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
religion because that would be just

211
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,000
circular reasoning more importantly I

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,000
found no spiritual resonance in the

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,759
houses of religion it looked to me then

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,800
as it looks to me now that most people

215
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,479
at these places of worship are just

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,400
laring none of it was inspiring to me

217
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,680
and I had no time for such things so I

218
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,319
just dismissed it I assumed that prayer

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,599
itself was meaningless because it felt

220
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,159
like Santa Claus wish fulfillment for

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,039
adults but here's the thing it works

222
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,639
anybody who engages truthfully and

223
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,360
honestly with prayer will tell you that

224
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,080
it just works you don't have to take my

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,840
word for it if you try what I'm going to

226
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,560
suggest for 7 days and if it doesn't

227
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,399
work out then it just quit you might say

228
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,599
that prayer is just a placebo that's

229
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,440
fine I'm not here to argue with anybody

230
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
the fact is there are life-changing

231
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,760
benefits that you can choose to access

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
if you want to I'm not making a

233
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,440
spiritual argument or even a scientific

234
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,760
argument I'm making an intentionally

235
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,080
practical argument because we live in a

236
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,720
materialistic Society not a spiritual

237
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,399
one I cannot prove that God exists nor

238
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,839
that he doesn't however I can prove that

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,800
prayer has tangible benefits it's a

240
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,640
testable hypothesis you can test this

241
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,000
out right now well in the 7-Day frame

242
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,480
and see if I'm right or wrong the worst

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,519
outcome is you wasted a couple minutes

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,480
if I'm right however you just change

245
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,920
your life forever if a belief system or

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,800
practice improves your life and gives

247
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,760
you power there's no reason to not at

248
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,839
least give it a shot even Jordan

249
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Peterson is in line with this message

250
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,160
when people ask him if he believes in

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,360
God he always answers I act as though

252
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,640
God exists he doesn't give a yes or no I

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,680
I always assumed that he was trying to

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,920
weasle his way out of it he doesn't want

255
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,200
to commit one way or other but now have

256
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,640
a deeper appreciation for his wisdom

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,000
what he's saying is actions speak louder

258
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,920
than words if he acts as though God

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,480
wants him to then that is more valuable

260
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,680
than just saying that he believes in God

261
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
besides it's impossible to choose to

262
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,320
have faith like I said in my previous

263
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
video where I discuss the history and

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,519
future of religion and make a prediction

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,640
as to what's coming in the internate age

266
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,279
faith is not a switch that you can turn

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,640
on or off you cannot choose to have

268
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,640
faith even if you wanted to you could be

269
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,640
a naturally skeptical and logical person

270
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,519
who simply cannot accept this stuff

271
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,839
without proof that's fine in this video

272
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,000
I haven't actually told you to believe

273
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,279
in anything I'm only here to tell you

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,200
the Practical and materialistic benefits

275
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,600
of prayer if you eventually change your

276
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,480
views after engaging in this practice

277
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,079
that's all you that's nothing to do with

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,640
me I going to give you a practical guide

279
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,160
and framework to get you started the

280
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,360
first step is we need to understand the

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,720
nature of God we need a framework to

282
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,839
understand God that is not so

283
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,760
philosophical and Abstract that we lose

284
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,800
any sense of intuitive understanding if

285
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,680
we'll think of God in the same way as

286
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,079
our ancestors did they thought of him as

287
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,440
a father Christianity calls God the

288
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,399
Divine father one of the three aspects

289
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,560
of the Holy Trinity the pagans worship

290
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,600
du putter or Sky father this is Zeus of

291
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,839
the Greeks this is Jupiter of the Romans

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,880
this is Indra of my forbear

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,360
regardless of your beliefs it is clear

294
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,880
that we as a species have this intuition

295
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,560
that God is a heavenly father who rules

296
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,360
over all let's use that exact same

297
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,000
picture of God as we move forward

298
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,320
imagine you were a father and you had a

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,079
son you'd like to shower your son with

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,240
gifts and love all the time but you also

301
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,639
want to see your son grow up to meet his

302
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,440
innate potential this means you can and

303
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,959
will help him but only if he's earned

304
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,320
your favor if your son is honest

305
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,959
hardworking resourceful and receptive to

306
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
your advice then of course you'll give

307
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,200
him a little boost and on the other hand

308
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,040
if your son is a lying cheating little

309
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,720
prick you might let him have success for

310
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,519
a little while but at the end you're

311
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,399
going to teach him a harsh lesson this

312
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,079
is the intuition for how God works the

313
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,240
Second Step you don't need to explain

314
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,519
your beliefs or your faith to anybody

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,399
it's not your job to be a spirit guide

316
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,880
to anybody perhaps except your own

317
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,160
children and your wife strangers don't

318
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,720
need to understand or be convinced this

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
is personal if it makes sense to you and

320
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,959
you gain benefit from it then literally

321
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,240
the entire Globe can call you a fool and

322
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,279
it wouldn't matter to be a man of faith

323
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,560
in this modern world is to be the

324
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,279
ultimate non-conformist we live in a

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,320
society that actively tries to Snuff out

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,760
any vestage of the spiritual and the

327
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,600
Divine wonder is not permitted here only

328
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,600
bureaucratic truth in the form of

329
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,680
peer-reviewed journals is available here

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,240
I want you to understand this science is

331
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,120
a powerful tool to understand reality

332
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,920
but its greatest strength is also its

333
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,320
greatest weakness science relies on the

334
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,519
ability to replicate results if an

335
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,279
observation is non-replicable it is

336
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,120
considered junk but here's the thing

337
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,160
there are observations that you can make

338
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,279
that are true yet they are nonreplicable

339
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,880
so many stories in history have men

340
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,839
doing heroic Deeds because they saw a

341
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,560
vision if a modern man was to see a

342
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,320
vision that he couldn't explain he would

343
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,600
immediately dismiss it as a

344
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,839
hallucination and considered himself to

345
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,720
be a schizophrenic don't be a modern man

346
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,519
have the courage to believe your own

347
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,440
eyes your own ears your own senses your

348
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,880
own intuition over trusting the words of

349
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,040
others this is why I always insist on

350
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,000
the Primacy of direct personal

351
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,240
observation and testing and to have

352
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,639
faith in your own intuition even when it

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,440
comes to health and diet topics which I

354
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,279
am passionate about and have covered in

355
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,480
this channel a couple times I openly

356
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,760
tell you to doubt my words until you try

357
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,279
them and see for yourself and so it is

358
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,920
with worship try and see for yourself

359
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,920
with 100% sincerity don't take my word

360
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,760
for it third step it is important to be

361
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,160
very careful what you ask for if you ask

362
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,240
for material things like cars and money

363
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,880
and women you'll likely get it but you

364
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
need to be very careful because stuff

365
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,720
like that comes at a heavy cost the

366
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,240
greatest things you can ask for will

367
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,199
actually strengthen your bond with with

368
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,160
the father think about this if you're a

369
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,560
kid and you ask your father for a PS5

370
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
you might get it but there's no

371
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,519
improvement in the bond between you and

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,279
the father if anything if you spend all

373
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,920
your time playing video games the bond

374
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,519
with your father might actually suffer

375
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,160
on the other hand if you ask your father

376
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,079
to get you a gym membership to the gym

377
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,680
that he goes to now we're on to

378
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,440
something not only do you get your

379
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,759
father's respect but your father will

380
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,519
actually grow more fond of you and

381
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,040
support you in your future endeavors and

382
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,120
spend more time with you much better to

383
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
us for things which will actually least

384
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,560
help you become a better person rather

385
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,839
than ask for physical stuff that you own

386
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,480
you can ask for good health you can ask

387
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,480
for the strength to be an honest man in

388
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,360
a dishonest time you can ask for the

389
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,079
courage to sacrifice pleasure for future

390
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,839
growth step four you use your voice

391
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
there is a difference between thinking

392
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
thoughts in your head versus saying them

393
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,279
out loud there is a difference between

394
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,160
thought and action huberman actually

395
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,920
talks about this how he verbally

396
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,079
expresses prayer rather than just saying

397
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,720
it in his head that the third sentence

398
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,959
in Genesis is and God said let there be

399
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,000
light and there was light God didn't

400
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,800
think light into existence in the

401
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,759
Christian tradition he spoke light into

402
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
existence now there's a question as to

403
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,880
what you should say how you should say

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,959
it and I'll give you a basic guide after

405
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,160
step five speaking of step five is

406
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,720
consistency and Progressive overload we

407
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
know how important the stuff is when we

408
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,839
think of the gym or even meditation the

409
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,600
same is true for prayer that being said

410
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,800
there are some clear differences you

411
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,800
cannot really track progress you cannot

412
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,839
buy better equipment or more supplements

413
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,519
however you can feel the progress and if

414
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,040
you can't put numbers on it you can

415
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,920
absolutely feel a protective Aura you

416
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,959
feel more resilient you become more

417
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,160
honest with others because you care less

418
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,360
about the Judgment of people you feel

419
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,720
Unstoppable because the heavens are with

420
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,560
you literally just include prayer in

421
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,120
your morning and nighttime routines and

422
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,720
just do it as a daily thing habits stack

423
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,240
it with something you do every day one

424
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,800
of the most important parts of my

425
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,000
morning routine is just stepping outside

426
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,920
in the sun after waking up I've always

427
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,360
said that this is to reset my circadian

428
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,880
rhythm to get better sleep at night and

429
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,680
to just have better overall health but

430
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,920
also what better time to offer up

431
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,920
worship to the heavens now I'm going to

432
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,319
give you the actionable steps the

433
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,040
autistic level practical guide here's

434
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,199
the basic format of worship start by

435
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,959
giving thanks Express gratitude for

436
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,519
literally anything which comes to your

437
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,720
mind the gym session laughing with your

438
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,040
friends the nice weather outside

439
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
whatever visual comes to your mind talk

440
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,880
about anything that made your day just a

441
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,680
little bit better even if you're having

442
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,480
a terrible day you can be thankful for

443
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,920
the ability to speak the ability to

444
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,639
breathe to walk then you speak of

445
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,959
something that could be improved

446
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,959
something that you need help with

447
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,040
something that is causing you pain think

448
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,600
of what character trait you would need

449
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,399
to overcome that pain that is imagine a

450
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
version of you that could defeat that

451
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,000
problem and come out on top do you need

452
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,920
to be more brutally honest with yourself

453
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,520
ask for the strength to be honest are

454
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,039
you struggling with a difficult decision

455
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,799
that's eating you up ask for guidance

456
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,160
are you feeling guilty about something

457
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,319
that you did ask for forgiveness in this

458
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,240
poll I asked what is causing the most

459
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,679
pain in your life and the majority

460
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,240
answer was lack of Direction well

461
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,679
there's two pieces to solving that

462
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,160
problem one is to take action to try new

463
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,000
things the other is to be able to listen

464
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,080
to the voice inside your head to listen

465
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,039
to that guiding voice but you have have

466
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,960
to ask for guidance in order to receive

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,039
it and that's it really that's the

468
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,360
fundamentals of prayer it's true of all

469
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,039
religions obviously if you have

470
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
adherence towards any particular

471
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,480
religion just incorporate my advice to

472
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
the practices of that religion I

473
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,120
personally have found a lot of benefit

474
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,880
in having a recital prayer every single

475
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,880
day this is the prayer dear father I

476
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,200

477
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,520

478
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,960
fortitude to live with honor give me the

479
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:07,000
wisdom to know my duty may my actions

480
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,000
speak for me as fortune favors the Bold
