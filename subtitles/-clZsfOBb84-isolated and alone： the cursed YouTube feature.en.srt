00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,300
[Music]

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,300
this is a certified Hood classic

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,260
I bet when you watch that Gillette ad

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,620
four years ago you felt disgusted

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,440
frustrated and confused as to why the

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,540
producers of that ad are freaking Razer

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,059
company which caters to men would

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,399
completely misunderstand what it meant

9
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,140
to be a man and then you went to the

10
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,180
dislikes and likes ratio and you

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,700
realized you weren't alone in your

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,680
frustration you saw that there was a lot

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,420
of more dislikes than there was likes

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,820
the ratio was something like ten to one

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,539
so you realized that you weren't alone

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,640
in your hatred and disgust at that ad

17
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,380
and that gave you a sense of calm

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,020
because you realized you weren't the

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,700
crazy one the company the mega

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,500
Corporation Proctor and Gamble who came

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,420
up with that ad they were the ones at

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,700
fault and you along with all the other

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,619
people who disliked that message were at

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,960
least together in your disapproval of

25
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,780
that message but now that ad is gone and

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,700
the whole dislikes to relax ratio on all

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,380
videos is gone of course this is not

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,180
news it's been four years something like

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,799
that since the likes to listen dislikes

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,960
sure was removed you're going to find

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,759
out why that really happened and lots

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,159
more besides you're going to learn the

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,040
basics of psychological operations or

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,140
psyops also you might learn how to make

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,520
some salmon that's what I'm going to do

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
today make some salmon and teach about

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,619
psychological operations so first thing

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,939
the Gillette ad was a psyop the ad did

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,380
not try to sell you anything they

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,180
weren't trying to sell razors with that

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,100
ad they were trying to bring about a

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,079
cultural shift using that ad and of

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,240
course it was a failed psyop the psyop

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,520
was [ __ ] terribly designed it was

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
stupid and it convinced nobody so it was

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,880
a failed sire but it's too blatant

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,220
there's two on the nose but that's not

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,020
usual if a psyop is well designed you

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,239
won't even know it's a Scion so the

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,220
first type of psyop is what I call the

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,020
ham-fisted approach you know the dumb

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,819
approach where the corporations just try

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,379
to throw [ __ ] out on the media and hope

54
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,879
that people are convinced by them that's

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,940
not a good way you do Scion the second

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,040
kind of Scio is the Iron Fist Scion that

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,720
is what YouTube did when it removed the

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,220
dislikes through likes ratio everybody

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,599
hated it everybody understood the

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,099
importance of that ratio but but you

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,540
couldn't really do anything about it so

62
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,459
that's how I worked but anyway we're

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,160
going way too fast when we slow down

64
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,020
make some salmon and yeah I know I know

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,180
the Salmon's rubbed in plastic I told

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,680
the guy not put in plastic but I guess

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,480
he didn't want to listen so let me turn

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
this thing on there we go got some heat

69
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,840
okay so first thing I want you to

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
understand sire is not some kind of

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,739
Internet term or like some Reddit term

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
no psychological operations is a real

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,519
thing in fact the US Army has a whole

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
branch called psychological operations

75
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,360
like you can literally go and be trained

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,739
as a psychological operations expert in

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,239
the US Army that's a real thing

78
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,040
psychological operations have been a

79
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,239
part of Warfare for the longest time I

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,980
will teach you what I know about the

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,959
topic and I need to get started making

82
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,599
this thing you need man I need my olive

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,159
oil all right I got my olive oil there

84
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,140
it is and you might be thinking why am I

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,599
cooking Outdoors today well I ask you

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,400
why are you cooking indoors today this

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,620
is a beautiful day I don't see why I

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
would be indoors so this is salmon a

89
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,400
fatty fish contains a lot of fat which I

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
like tastes great has a lot of protein

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,180
here's some olive oil another source of

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,879
healthy fats because it is a mono

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,280
unsaturated that's right timono

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,040
unsaturated fat which I'm fine with I'm

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,900
cooking with cast iron pan which is of

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,819
course the traditional and correct and

97
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,159
aesthetically pleasing way to cook

98
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,080
anything let's look more closely at the

99
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,879
YouTube removing the dislikes button or

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,799
rather I should say the dyslex ratio why

101
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,019
did they do that they say and we don't

102
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,120
believe them obviously they say that

103
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,920
they wanted to help all creators with

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,080
their mental health [ __ ] they say

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
that they wanted to make YouTube a more

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
safe and welcoming place for new

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
creators so that they would not be

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,540
attacked by bullies who would dislike

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,700
their videos absolute [ __ ] no small

110
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,319
creators are saying they want to be

111
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,819
protected by dislikes that's another

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,680
thing that was [ __ ] from the start

113
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,420
everybody knew it but think actually

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,820
what's going on who are they actually

115
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,400
protecting they're protecting not small

116
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,320
creators but rather some very big and

117
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,300
unpopular creators first the

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,280
corporations the mega corporations who

119
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,139
put out stupid ads and have bad

120
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,360
messaging and they don't want to be

121
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,620
dislike bombed and made fun of like

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,720
Proctor and Gamble with their Gillette

123
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,560
that is one easy example everybody hated

124
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,360
that ad and probably their PR team

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,340
realized how damaging it was that's one

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,900
just one example then we have Pepsi you

127
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,880
know how Pepsi made that stupid ad with

128
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,800
Kylie Jenner and I believe Kylie Jenner

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,900
was you know Waltzing around during a

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,259
protest and the whole ad was just stupid

131
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,240
here's your salmon there we go there we

132
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,040
go got some heat

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,720
so you put this away

134
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,940
and then we continue talking about

135
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,380
psyops oh this is a big piece of salmon

136
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,880
I didn't want that bigger piece the

137
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,800
bigger the piece it's harder to cook but

138
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,360
that's fine more bigger the beef more

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,940
nutrition right so I'm okay with that

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,080
you want to actually start on the skin

141
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,720
side

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,360
so I'm going to flip it oh yes

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,919
the skin side first get the skin going

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,199
it's going to become nice and crunchy

145
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,400
always get the salmon with the skin it

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,620
just tastes better in my personal

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,680
opinion of course first rule of

148
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,100
evaluating psyops is you always look at

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,220
the Garment or corporations actions

150
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,039
rather than their words of course words

151
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,680
are wind and you never want to evaluate

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,660
a corporation or government activity by

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,940
what they say this is also true for

154
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,020
individuals you know if a girl says she

155
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
wants to go on a date but she always

156
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,560
makes excuses she's not into your book I

157
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,720
mean even guy friends like if they're

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,460
always not let you be a part of their

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,380
friend group or whatever it is it's not

160
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,900
your group they don't care about you so

161
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,820
you always evaluate by the actions

162
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,500
rather than the words because words are

163
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,060
wind words are cheap you can say

164
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,919
whatever the [ __ ] you want but when it

165
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,259
comes to acting that's when you have

166
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
skin in the game skin in the game a

167
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,620
great book by nathim nicholesterolab you

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
should read it the reason I know YouTube

169
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,660
doesn't give a [ __ ] about small creators

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,479
is they run ads on small creators you

171
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,039
YouTube videos and don't pay them a dime

172
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,479
that's right and you don't have the

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,520
ability to turn them off either if

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
you're an unmonetized Channel meaning if

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,660
you have less than 1 000 subscribers and

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,979
you don't have 4 000 watch hours YouTube

177
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,780
is still running ads on your videos

178
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,180
whether you like it or not and you don't

179
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,220
have the permission to turn Those ads

180
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,139
off and you want to tell me that YouTube

181
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,880
cares about small creators absolute

182
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,800
[ __ ] but anyway going back to what

183
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,960
actions are like I said actions speak

184
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,639
louder than words right what are the

185
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,039
actual actions YouTube performed who are

186
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,919
they actually protecting first they're

187
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,440
protecting degenerate filled music

188
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,840
videos like freaking Nicki Minaj and

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,460
cardi B and all that garbage music it's

190
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,039
more pornographic than it is actually

191
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,020
music they protect that that [ __ ] is not

192
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,300
censored even kids can watch that [ __ ]

193
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,520
and YouTube has no problem with it

194
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,080
because there's money to be made and at

195
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,680
the end of the day it's about the money

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,479
boys it's always been about the money

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,600
that's one thing the second thing

198
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,720
YouTube protects Legacy Media news CNN

199
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,060
then MSNBC even Fox News to some extent

200
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,220
YouTube protects these big so-called

201
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,680
credible news sources and they put out

202
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,080
you know garbage news half the time they

203
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,060
divide us as a nation they divide us as

204
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,860
a society and that's the [ __ ] which they

205
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,440
want to protect for reasons which go

206
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,520
beyond me well I can I sign my

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,259
suspicions but I'm not going to go into

208
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
that in this video but either case

209
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,560
Legacy news Medias is what they're

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,900
protecting and then they're protecting

211
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,639
of course your White House the White

212
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,139
House produced some videos which I'm not

213
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,479
going to mention which ones which got

214
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,340
massive dislikes to right likes ratio

215
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,599
and of course eventually they removed

216
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,099
that ratio you can't see the ratio

217
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,419
anymore so if you disapprove of

218
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,099
something the government does or

219
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,380
something a big Corporation does you

220
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,120
will be made to feel alone I want you to

221
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,280
understand this very carefully at the

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,139
surface level everybody knows that

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,460
YouTube is not doesn't care about the

224
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,660
small creators and they care about the

225
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,699
big money interests and the government

226
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,560
everybody knows that that's not news

227
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,440
that's not what the point of this video

228
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,539
is the point of this video is the reason

229
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,819
why they did it is so that you feel

230
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,639
alone in your frustration and your

231
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,960
disgusting get this straight so we all

232
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,940
know that YouTube's on the side of the

233
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
big advertising big money government Etc

234
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,560
that's fine I we know that but the

235
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
reason why they got rid of that ratio is

236
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,819
so that when you hate something when you

237
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,860
dislike something you don't have the

238
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,959
support of others you don't realize that

239
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,760
you're not alone near frustration all

240
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,800
you see is a number of likes you don't

241
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
see the number of dislikes understand

242
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,099
that carefully let me let me give an

243
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,380
example let's just go with the

244
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,140
degenerate filth videos right like Nicki

245
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,940
Minaj or some [ __ ] or even some and or

246
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,260
some bad corporate video you can see how

247
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,940
many people liked it but you aren't able

248
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,100
to see how many people disliked it so if

249
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,779
you dislike it you're alone you feel

250
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,339
alone because you don't realize how many

251
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,800
people actually have your back that's

252
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,899
the actual Psy up here that's the

253
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Sinister and disgusting part of what

254
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,040
YouTube did but YouTube is just a stupid

255
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,959
example like there's far more dangerous

256
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,940
psyops out there which I will try to

257
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,399
deconstruct on this channel but I want

258
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,740
you to understand a lone wolf can be

259
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,279
domesticated that that's why they want

260
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,540
you alone it's easier to subdue you if

261
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,480
you think you're alone and you're

262
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,399
disgust of the stuff which big media big

263
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,440
corporations and big government does so

264
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,779
what's the proof of what I'm saying well

265
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,339
the proof is that the dislike button is

266
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,200
still there think about this for the

267
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,580
first thing as a Creator on the back end

268
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,779
of YouTube I can actually see the number

269
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,339
of dislikes so they're not actually

270
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,200
protecting my mental health so to speak

271
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,540
but more importantly they still have

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,000
that dislike button out there we can

273
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,880
still hit it and still dislike a video

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,040
but two things first disliking a video

275
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,320
does absolutely nothing it does not

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,120
change your YouTube recommendations many

277
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,980
Studies have shown this the second thing

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,300
I as a Creator can see the number of

279
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,040
dislikes but even that doesn't do

280
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,480
anything so why do they allow the

281
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,519
dislike button to stay they've removed

282
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,260
the ratio they could just keep the like

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,080
button but they had dislike button too

284
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,899
the reason why they have this well I'll

285
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,420
give you a study there's a study done on

286
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,880
mice or monkeys I forget which but they

287
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,740
had a button in their cage and when the

288
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,440
monkey hit the button it would get a

289
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,300
treat and then you know they let that

290
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,680
run for a couple weeks and then they

291
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,839
made it such the treat would fall

292
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,339
randomly when the button was hit so

293
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
sometimes when the button was hit the

294
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,279
tree would fall and sometimes when the

295
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,140
button was hit the street wouldn't fall

296
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,820
and sometimes that root would fall

297
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,560
regardless of the button was pressed or

298
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,600
not but the monkeys never stopped

299
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,220
pressing the button for weeks and weeks

300
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
they still pressed the button because

301
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,640
they felt that hitting the button

302
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,200
increased their chances of getting the

303
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,880
treat they thought that there was a

304
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,440
cause and effect they thought that they

305
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,300
were responsible they thought that they

306
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,160
had power over their situation which

307
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,200
wasn't the case it was random that is

308
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,540
what the dislike button is you are a

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,760
monkey hitting a button which doesn't do

310
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,339
anything like I said in the starting of

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,680
this video there's three types of sale

312
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,000
first of the clumsy ham-fisted psyop

313
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,040
like the Gillette ad which doesn't go

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,440
anywhere doesn't do anything second is

315
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,720
the Iron Fist psyop like what YouTube

316
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,740
did we knew what was going on but we

317
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,480
couldn't do anything about it because

318
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,279
YouTube owns YouTube you know or rather

319
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,779
I should say Google owns YouTube there's

320
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
a third type of Psy up the most

321
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,220
successful type of Psy of the psyob that

322
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,660
you don't even know is going on or at

323
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,579
least the vast majority of people don't

324
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,440
know what's going on and this is the

325
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,060
Sinister stuff this is the stuff which

326
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
might get me in trouble maybe I'll give

327
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,079
you some easy examples the sugar

328
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,600
industry literally paid off Harvard

329
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,399
professors and scientists to say that

330
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,860
sugar was good or rather I should say

331
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,300
carbs were good and fats were bad this

332
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,160
is not some Reddit conspiracy theory

333
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,260
this literally happened is documented by

334
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
the Howard Department themselves they

335
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,339
themselves owned up to the fact that

336
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,959
they were paid off by the sugar Lobby so

337
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,180
they created this psyop saying that

338
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,560
scientifically proving that carbs were

339
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,800
better than fat that was the ultimate

340
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,019
psyop the food pyramid with ssiop it was

341
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,700
a sire backed by the government probably

342
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,160
more people died because of the food

343
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,100
pyramid and the and the lies around the

344
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,339
food pyramid than the actual well the

345
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,680
possible viral contamination which

346
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,779
spread across the globe and may or may

347
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,940
not have come from any East Asian

348
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,100
country that one I would suggest that

349
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,019
the food pyramid killed more people than

350
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,240
that which I just mentioned so what are

351
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,579
some other examples of the velvet glove

352
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
psyop so there's the hand-fisted style

353
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,700
there's the Iron Fist side up and

354
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,380
there's a velvet glove side where you

355
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,360
don't even realize a psyop is going on

356
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,860
I'll use some more examples Tick Tock is

357
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,300
one of them have you ever seen the

358
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,160
Chinese version of tick tock I have a

359
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,560
Chinese friend and I saw his version of

360
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,440
tick tock it's actually not bad like the

361
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,420
content on there is is wholesome I don't

362
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,160
want to forget my my salmon so how do

363
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,440
you know your Salmon's done you can just

364
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,000
prod it like this and you see how it's

365
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,980
all pink inside that means it's not done

366
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,360
yet and by the way since I'm making this

367
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,100
for myself and not for some fancy

368
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,959
restaurant I will happily break my

369
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,300
salmon apart I don't care this is just

370
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,519
for my nutrition and health and taste

371
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,260
anyway coming back to freaking psyops

372
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,060
right so Tick Tock I mean this is also a

373
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,320
known sire but you like you and me we

374
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,660
know that Tick Tock is a psyop right

375
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,639
it's basically Chinese government owns

376
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,160
the freaking platform so they push out

377
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,860
degenerate filth on Western versions of

378
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,019
tick tock while they maintain the

379
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,300
traditional and you know social social

380
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,100
supporting aspects on their own Tick

381
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,260
Tock which is also a psy-op so basically

382
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,779
the Chinese government they want

383
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,760
pro-social behaviors in China right so

384
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,920
their Tick Tock promotes that kind of

385
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,500
behavior that's a sign up on the other

386
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,040
hand we in the west we're freaking dumb

387
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,959
immoral and absolutely untraditional so

388
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,880
where when we have Tick Tock all we see

389
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,800
is degenerate [ __ ] and that prompts our

390
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,899
Behavior to be more degenerate but fine

391
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,579
fine you say that's that's just a boring

392
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,680
example of psyop that's fine everybody

393
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,440
knows it I'll give you another one why

394
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,240
do we have fluoride in our water it's

395
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,180
for our teeth right are you still sure

396
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,100
about that well I'm not so sure and

397
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,139
perhaps I'll make a video about this if

398
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,639
you want that video type down fluoride

399
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,540
in a comment below so I know there's

400
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,660
interest

401
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,120
and then there's the trans fats so have

402
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,240
you ever seen a tub of margarine

403
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,279
it literally says It's Not Butter it's

404
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
margarine as though that's a good thing

405
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,160
and people believed it is a good thing

406
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
for the longest time because scientists

407
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,200
were paid off by the oil Lobby the seed

408
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,880
oil Lobby I should say to say that trans

409
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,700
fats were healthy for you which is

410
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,380
garbage trans fats are horrible for you

411
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,720
but no and you know how trans fats are

412
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,860
created they literally treat seed oils

413
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,980
which are kind of toxic on their own

414
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,500
with with hexane and hexane is it's a

415
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,680
toxin so this thing the stove runs on

416
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,360
butane or propane I'm not sure hexane is

417
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,920
very similar to butane and Propane in in

418
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,800
terms of chemical structure they use

419
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,959
that to treat a food product and then

420
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,940
they oxidize it and pressurize it and

421
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,040
you create trans fat and they manage to

422
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,839
convince the entire U.S public and the

423
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,699
world's public the trans fats were

424
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,940
actually healthy for you and then today

425
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,560
the current trend is that

426
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,380
polyunsaturated fatty acids so pufa

427
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,260
pufas polyunsaturated fatty acids like

428
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,639
canola oil all seed oils basically they

429
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,399
say that they're good for you American

430
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,279
Heart Association is completely funded

431
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,540
by the seed oil Lobby of course the

432
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,740
American Heart Association is going to

433
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,779
say that seed oils are good for you

434
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,300
they're funded by the seed oils that's

435
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,339
an example of a velvet glove Scion the

436
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,899
general public has no idea that seed

437
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,540
oils are bad for them every restaurant

438
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,980
uses seed oils but anyway that's a

439
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,660
different topic and I'll go into the

440
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,060
topic of seed oils in a different video

441
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,740
if you want that video comment down in

442
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,480
this freaking comment section seed oil

443
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,980
so I know that there's interest in that

444
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,540
topic so how do you protect yourself

445
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,040
from psyops that's the question right

446
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,920
what's the actionable steps well I'll

447
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,079
tell you first thing stop watching the

448
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,540
news freaking pointless the news of

449
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,880
today is just propaganda depending on

450
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,740
who runs the news channel it's divisive

451
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,500
it's useless it's emotionally

452
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,300
manipulative it's utter garbage it's all

453
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,540
done for the sake of keeping you passive

454
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,160
and panicked and makes you feel that you

455
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,899
don't have control over your own destiny

456
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,820
that's the point of news nowadays I

457
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,380
think it's a true waste of time to watch

458
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,579
the news or even read the news at this

459
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,320
point if you have knowledge but you

460
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,360
don't have power to act on it it's

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,339
useless I actually got that concept from

462
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,779
the four hour work week by Tim Ferriss

463
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,880
which is another book I would strongly

464
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,040
recommend you see it used to be the case

465
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,079
that you are the sum of the five closest

466
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,839
people to you it's now becoming the case

467
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,100
that you are a sum of the Phi

468
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,019
influencers that you follow the most so

469
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,579
I would suggest choose five to ten

470
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,740
influencers you know YouTubers whatever

471
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,779
you want and then unsubscribe from

472
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,519
everybody else turn on the Bell button

473
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,959
for those five to ten creators it

474
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
doesn't have to be me could be whoever

475
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,480
you choose and then only go to YouTube

476
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,540
to watch the videos from those select

477
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,160
select select YouTubers that way you're

478
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,899
not being bombarded by information that

479
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,940
you can't use you're getting information

480
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,560
from sources that you trust and you

481
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,480
aren't being emotionally manipulated

482
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,480
like the mainstream media does that's

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,980
your way to avoid all these psyops but

484
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,040
that's not enough because you still need

485
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,420
information so in my upcoming seed oil

486
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,420
video which I do want to make that video

487
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,940
I'm going to explain how I evaluate

488
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,459
what's true so science I'm a scientist

489
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,660
so I understand how that sausage is made

490
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,780
you know I understand the scientific

491
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,360
Community how peer review works all that

492
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,000
stuff science is a tool it's a very very

493
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,579
powerful and effective tool at coming to

494
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,799
the truth but it has its flaws and it's

495
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,319
only one tool in my arsenal of finding

496
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,839
out what is true so that's science I

497
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,480
also rely on philosophy I also rely on

498
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,700
my instinct I also rely on personal

499
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,860
observation of fact but anyway I don't

500
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,780
want to go into that in this video in my

501
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,700
seed oil video if you know if there's

502
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,340
enough interest in it I will go into how

503
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,679
I evaluate what is true going with the

504
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,940
science but also adding other elements

505
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,740
to make sure the design is still

506
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,240
misleading me anyway knowledge is

507
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,120
useless unless you have the power to

508
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,039
change your destiny and power is your

509
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,960
connections and how much money you have

510
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,520
many other things too but connections

511
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,900
and money are two of the big ones and

512
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
that's one of the reasons I have created

513
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,140
this YouTube channel I want to make more

514
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,940
money and I want to have amazing

515
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,500
connections with people who also have

516
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,080
power and money I've made connections

517
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,640
with some amazing guy eyes through my

518
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,320
YouTube coaching service if you want to

519
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,000
know anything about that check the link

520
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,340
in the description below but coming back

521
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,500
to this salmon so what's going on here

522
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,539
you see the fats rendering out that's

523
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,940
completely normal I would actually want

524
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,679
to increase the heat but oh I didn't

525
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,240
realize it but the fire had gone out

526
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,740
because of the wind so that's why it's

527
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,380
not done

528
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,720
well my bad so that's that's fine though

529
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,220
it's just a piece of fish it'll cook I

530
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,799
need to actually make this fish now so

531
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,419
what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm

532
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,100
going to place this here to protect

533
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,720
against the wind some of you might think

534
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,299
I ruined myself and because I shredded

535
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,280
it like this not at all I actually want

536
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:43,320
every part of the salmon to get some

537
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,419
heat so I'm sure it's fully cooked I'm

538
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,120
not one of the guys who likes my salmon

539
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,400
slightly Raw I don't trust it

540
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,880
fish do have parasites in them sometimes

541
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,179
so I do genuinely want every single

542
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,940
piece of my fish to feel the heat before

543
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,100
I eat it it's just my concern like I

544
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,440
never eat sushi because Sushi literally

545
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,240
has parasites in it sometimes worms like

546
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,340
people who eat a lot of sushi they

547
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,980
literally have worms in their intestines

548
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,299
I do not eat sushi for that reason and

549
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
when I'm cooking fish like I am right

550
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,620
now I make sure that I'm cooking it all

551
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,840
the way through I don't give a single

552
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,880
[ __ ] how it looks or how the

553
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,039
presentation is I'm not cooking it for a

554
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,539
restaurant I'm cooking it for myself and

555
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,640
these are the standards which make me

556
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,960
happy make me contented so that's what

557
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,539
I'm gonna go with that's what cooking is

558
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,120
all about cooking is about preparing

559
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,980
nutritious meals that you enjoy you and

560
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,539
your friends and family enjoy it's not

561
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,299
about how the food looks like in the end

562
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:41,280
and also I should say fish right it's

563
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,020
fish healthy especially from a

564
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,720
testosterone and hormonal point of view

565
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,840
you see I have some bad news for you on

566
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,140
this on this aspect fish is a very very

567
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,900
healthy meal for most of human history

568
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,580
fish has a lot of healthy fats Omega-3s

569
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,460
I'm sure you already know and salmon

570
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:03,419
especially is a fantastic food until

571
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:06,059
today until the modern industrial era

572
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,179
until the age of plastic because you see

573
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,280
all the fertilizer runoff goes into the

574
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,559
rivers goes into the Lakes goes into the

575
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,200
ocean all the microplastics Plastics

576
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,840
endocrine disruptors all of it goes into

577
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,900
the lakes rivers and oceans and the poor

578
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,100
fish they consume these it builds up in

579
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,679
their bodies

580
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,200
and they actually have serious

581
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,080
reproductive health issues because of

582
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,780
these endocrine disruptions so fish are

583
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,059
literally born with male and female

584
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,100
reproductive organs so they aren't able

585
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,380
to reproduce happens all the time and

586
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,120
happens across the globe it's really

587
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,400
messed up what's happening to our marine

588
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,380
ecosystem so when we catch those fish

589
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
and eat them you know that's not really

590
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,419
healthy for us most of the time so this

591
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,860
is fish you might ask me you know if I

592
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,559
say fish is unhealthy because it's

593
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,860
polluted why am I having fish well two

594
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,500
reasons and also Mercury a lot of fish

595
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,520
is polluted with Mercury salmon is

596
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,320
actually one of the better ones so

597
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,600
that's why I chose salmon but even then

598
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,520
going back to my question if fish is so

599
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,919
bad for you why am I having fish right

600
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,620
well one thing I have fish very very

601
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,419
rarely so I'm minimizing my exposure to

602
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,880
the harmful chemicals present in most

603
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:20,640
fish the second thing is I don't want to

604
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,460
live in fear you see this channel has

605
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,700
never been about living in fear here

606
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,580
it's about knowledge it's about wisdom

607
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,080
it's about understanding the environment

608
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,240
understanding your food so that you can

609
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,360
make your choices in an informed fashion

610
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,760
I know that this fish probably has some

611
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,799
endocrine disrupting chemicals in it

612
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,720
however there's the highest quality fish

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,700
that I could possibly find and it's wild

614
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,220
caught it's not Factory farmed it's

615
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,200
really good salmon so that minimizes my

616
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,600
risk to some extent the other thing is

617
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,400
salmon has a lot of healthy fats which

618
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,559
actually help me in my testosterone

619
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,640
production so to some extent the

620
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,980
endocrine disruption is actually

621
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
outweighed by the healthy fats in this

622
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,419
fish so I understand the risks I'm

623
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,419
taking I understand the benefits of this

624
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,460
fish and I do think it's okay to have

625
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,860
high quality fish every now and then

626
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,260
maybe you know once in two weeks or once

627
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,240
in a week that's fine and that's the

628
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,400
level of risk I recommend you take and

629
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,799
again this channel has never been and my

630
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,720
message has never been to live in fear

631
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,539
of plastics and endocrine disruptors

632
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,500
rather the goal has always been to be

633
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,419
educated

634
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,419
and to have the wisdom to understand

635
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:33,840
with discernment to make your buying

636
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,960
choices and eating choices more healthy

637
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,940
that is not the best looking meal but

638
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,360
I'm not optimizing for looks I'm

639
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,559
optimizing for Taste and

640
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,559
what does it taste like

641
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,260
perfect

642
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,179
this is

643
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,740
salmon

644
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,020
stir-fried

645
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,659
easiest possible food literally no

646
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,700
ingredients just a salmon I added pepper

647
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,140
and salt in the marinade so yeah I did

648
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,780
marinate the salmon so what you got to

649
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,659
do is take lemon juice take your salmon

650
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,179
fillet put it in a glass container put

651
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,980
lemon juice put salt and pepper and I

652
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,740
didn't do this my I asked my butcher to

653
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,140
do it for me so he made it happen here

654
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,120
we are with an amazing plate of salmon

655
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,580
cooked the way I like it and the skin

656
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,919
though the skin is the best part I think

657
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,500
I left my like Fork a knife in the car

658
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,120
so I'm going to get it anyway I had fun

659
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,980
making this video I think I was ranting

660
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,280
a little bit but that's fine see you

661
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,280
next one

662
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:53,550
[Music]

663
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,320
thank you
