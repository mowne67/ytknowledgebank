1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hormones are the real big magic. A few

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,680
nanogs of a hormone can turn a baby calf

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,679
into a Belgian bull on a diet of grass.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,759
Hormones can put a beard on a woman or

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
give a man tits. They can take a skinny

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,640
man and turn him into Hercules reborn.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,720
But the changes are not just physical.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,039
The right hormonal profile, and I'm not

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,840
just talking about testosterone, can

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
turn an underachieving brain fog man

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,480
into a beacon of light and success in

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
his community. The question is how does

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,480
a man achieve the ideal hormonal

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
profile? The mistake many scientists

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,920
make is that they take a reductionist

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
approach. That is they speak of the

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
various hormones to optimize in

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239
isolation without looking at the whole.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
This approach is doomed to failure when

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
you take these theoreticals and try to

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
put them into action. I will tell you

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
the story of the magic elephant of Nepal

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
to drive this point home. You may think

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,360
that you've heard the story, but you

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,360
haven't heard the secret ending. The

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
king of Nepal brings his magic elephant

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,440
to the village of the blind. The blind

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
men naturally want to examine this

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
wondrous creature. One man, the first

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
who gets there, says, "Behold, the

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,479
elephant is like a python, strong but

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,560
flexible as he holds the trunk." And the

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,200
other says, "No, sir. The elephant is

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
like a pillar, rigid and mighty as he

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
has his arms wrapped around the leg."

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,159
The third man says, "Are you all fools?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Clearly, the elephant is like a spear.

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
The mighty curved thunderbolt of Lord

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,799
Indra himself. You may have heard this

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,680
first part of the story, but not what

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,320
comes next. The wise old elephant who

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
had been patient all along bellows. You

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,600
are all fools. I'm the mighty elephant,

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,799
king of beasts. I am the python, the

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,000
pillar, and the spear. I am also a rope,

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,920
a fan, and a stone wall. Even if you

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
could comprehend all of these, you would

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,040
not truly understand me. Allow me to

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
roam freely in nature to do as I please

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,479
to meet my tribe to meet my wife and

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,719
calves then you may begin to understand

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,200
when I'm here brought as a prisoner

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,040
against my will even the mighty king who

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,159
does have the eyes to see cannot

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,200
understand what I am and what I can be

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,200
the elephant of course is correct it is

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,440
not sufficient to understand the parts

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
of a system to understand the whole it's

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
not even sufficient to understand how

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
the parts are interconnected in fact you

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,720
must step back and watch the system

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,120
behave and go towards its goals. And so

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,200
it is with the hormone engine. You must

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
step back to understand the whole. In

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
this course, I have an ambitious goal to

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
present to you a unified field theory of

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
the hormone engine in men. I want to

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
give you the whole elephant. Not just

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
that, but I also want to teach you how

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
to ride the elephant. That is how to

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
harness the hormone engine to take you

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
where you want to go and to crush any

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
obstacle that comes your way. If you are

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
living beneath your ability, if you

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
don't have clarity, energy, and follow

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
through in order to achieve your dream

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
lifestyle, it just means you don't have

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
the right hormone profile. That's what's

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
holding you back. It's not your

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,599
background. It's not your parenting. All

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,760
of that is secondary to the hormone

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,760
profile. I know exactly how this feels

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
because I spent years in the dungeons of

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
the biology department trying to earn a

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,800
PhD to impress my parents and to gain

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,879
status. I spent years in brain fog and

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
confusion. I was broke. I was depressed

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,640
and I lost the girl off my dreams

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,800
because I didn't have the mental frame

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,560
or mindset that I have now. Most people

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,959
don't know this, but mindset is

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
downstream of the hormone profile.

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,120
Recently, I asked you what would make an

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,959
unstoppable entrepreneur. You said

95
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,360
creativity, confidence, risk-taking,

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,519
impulse control, unshakable pain

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
tolerance. But where do these really

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
come from? I could have saved years of

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,239
my life if I knew what I know now. Our

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,120
hormone profile shapes our actions and

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,640
our actions shape our hormone profile.

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,760
This is a feedback loop, a vicious

103
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,599
cycle. Losing gives you a hormone

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
profile that makes you lose more. This

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,000
can quickly become an iron cage with no

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,159
escape. But the opposite is also true.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Winning gives you a hormone profile that

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,799
makes you win more. Instead of an iron

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599
cage, you have an iron train engine that

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,200
gains momentum with every yard. The aim

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,200
of this course is to help you turn your

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
hormone engine on so that it can take

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,440
you wherever you want to go. For me, my

114
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,239
dream was freedom. Just freedom, man.

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Freedom to travel where I please. Travel

116
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,440
to work when I please. The freedom to

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
associate with whom I wanted to.

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Location freedom, time freedom, and

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,160
relationship freedom. That was my

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,479
deepest and dearest objective for so

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,639
many years. The sooner you fix your

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,759
hormone engine, the more time you will

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
have to reap the rewards of doing so. In

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
this course, I will share a decade of

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
bio research that have tested on men

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,040
just like yourself. This video will

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,800
serve as a reference and as a toolkit

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,680
which will help you gain an asymmetric

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
advantage over other men, but only if

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
you make the choice to act on it.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,520
Remember, we all make choices, but in

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,199
the end, our choices make us. Most

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
people don't know this, but we go

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
through two puberties in our life. One

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
is in our late teens or early 20s, but

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,479
really that's the second one. The first

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
puberty is when you are still an unborn

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,639
infant in your mother's womb. You get a

139
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,720
massive testosterone spike during this

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
phase. The strength of this testosterone

141
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,000
boost is actually phenomenal. Every baby

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
starts off looking basically female.

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,199
Actually, it's this testosterone boost.

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,680
It changes that it causes the formation

145
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,440
of the balls and the dick. It literally

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,039
is what makes you male in the first

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
place. You can actually check this right

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,120
now if you got a sufficient boost as a

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,919
baby or not. Place your palm flat on the

150
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,080
tabletop and see if your ring finger is

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
longer than your index finger. Bigger

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
the difference, the more of a

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,600
testosterone spike you received as a

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
baby. This weird ratio of the lengths of

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
your index and ring fingers is actually

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
correlated to athletic performance and

157
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,880
even aggression in males. If you do the

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,320
same test on a woman, you'll find that

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840
there's actually no difference between

160
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,360
the length of the ring finger and the

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
index finger. And this makes sense

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
because women did not receive that

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
legendary testosterone boost. Here's

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
another test to check if you have enough

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,960
free testosterone in your bloodstream

166
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,199
right now. If you're below the age of 40

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,880
and you don't wake up with a boner most

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,520
days, you're either chronically

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,520
stressed, underreovering, or possibly

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
have low free testosterone, or more

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,039
likely a combination of the three. Now,

172
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
why would you not get the full

173
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
testosterone boost as a baby? It's

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,680
either genetics, or it's the mother's

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
health, or it's because of

176
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,280
xenoestrogens, toxins that have found

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,680
their way into our food and water that

178
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,120
mimic the female hormone system. Now,

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
this is not news to you, so I will not

180
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
dwell on it for long. You already know

181
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,880
this that testosterone rates are in

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
freef fall. You already know that sperm

183
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
counts and fertility rates in most

184
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,120
countries are in existential level

185
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
threat. But what you may not know or

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
what you may not have realized is that

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,600
this is not a new phenomenon. Even

188
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,319
before the advent of xenoestrogens, most

189
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,240
of human society is manufactured to

190
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,680
control

191
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,000
testosterone. Laws, customs, and

192
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,479
religions are all built to regulate and

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
channel testosterone. However, today we

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,400
are more aware of this than ever before

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,240
and we have the tools to chart our own

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,039
destiny. Let us discuss these tools and

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,919
the underlying mechanisms at this time.

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,080
Testosterone makes effort feel good.

199
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,720
You've likely heard this before. Here's

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,479
what you have not heard. Feeling good

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,240
about effort makes testosterone. If you

202
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,000
study the hormone engine long enough,

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919
you will see some patterns. One of the

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
patterns which I've seen is that which

205
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,720
causes a result is also caused by the

206
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,199
result. Here's an example from the great

207
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
neuroscientist Robert Sapolski that will

208
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,360
make things clear for you. You've heard

209
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,160
that if you win at sports, you'll get a

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
huge testosterone spike. Not so clear.

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,240
When you dig in, it actually becomes

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,639
much more interesting. In the '90s, they

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,280
looked at testosterone levels of men who

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
were participating in a marathon. Yes,

215
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,280
the winner had a spike of testosterone,

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,759
but a minor one. The guy who came 73rd

217
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
had a much bigger spike. So, it's

218
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
confusing. What's going on? Turns out

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
the guy who came first did 3 minutes

220
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,319
worse than his best time. So, he didn't

221
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,879
feel like a winner. And the guy who came

222
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,440
73rd, he just aimed to be in the top

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
100. So, that the fact that he made 73rd

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,800
was actually a huge win for him. In

225
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,440
other words, perception and testosterone

226
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,199
have a two-way connection.

227
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
You've probably heard of testosterone

228
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,760
being used in a hierarchy, as in the top

229
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
male in a hierarchy has more

230
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,880
testosterone, the bottom male has the

231
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,479
least. And this is taken to mean that if

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
you increase testosterone, then your

233
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
position in the hierarchy would

234
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,320
increase. But this is not true. Let's

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
say there are five chimps and they

236
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
formed a hierarchy. If you took the

237
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
middle chimp, chimp number three, and

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
you shot him full of testosterone, he

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
would not magically take the number one

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,200
spot. In fact, he would continue to

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
cling on to the number three spot even

242
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,760
more strongly. In other words, he would

243
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
actually be more subservient to number

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,160
one and number two. But not just this,

245
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
he would also be more tyrannical to

246
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,959
chimps number four and five. So, put it

247
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,680
another way, if you were a normie to

248
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,760
begin with, then increasing testosterone

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
just would make you a turbbor.

250
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,040
Testosterone on its own does not make

251
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
you a winner. It's like money. Money

252
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,200
doesn't make you a winner. It's like

253
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,760
Andrew Tate of all people said, "Dorks

254
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
who made their millions from

255
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,560
cryptocurrency just became turbo dorks."

256
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,640
All testosterone does, it turns up the

257
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,519
volume on the personality traits that

258
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,600
already exist. That is why in my cohort

259
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
systems, we employ a novel technique

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
that targets multiple hormone systems in

261
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
parallel with testosterone. Since we are

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,080
not going for a testosterone boost as

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,600
such, we're going for comprehensive

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,600
transformation.

265
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
Sapolski gives this funny anecdote that

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
if you pumped a group of Buddhist monks

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,000
full of testosterone, then all of them

268
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
would aggressively compete to see who

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,680
performed the most random acts of

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,920
kindness. This is because all

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,640
testosterone can do is amplify

272
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,959
competition within existing frameworks

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,120
and amplify behaviors also within

274
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,200
existing personality frameworks.

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,399
Speaking of competition, most males of

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,800
any mamalian species don't have sex, let

277
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,519
alone have kids. Yes, testosterone is

278
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
predictive of sexual success, especially

279
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,160
in elephant seals and antler animals.

280
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,720
The correlation is striking. In fact,

281
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
males will tear off each other's balls

282
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,079
in a in an a bid to win the fight.

283
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,399
Essentially, nature is brutal and the

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,000
brutality of nature is always just an

285
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,200
inch beneath the surface of human

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,760
society. Testosterone males forage

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,760
further. They fight harder and endure

288
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
much more punishment in order to get

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,839
what they want. But it's not just that.

290
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
They also seek more novelty. That is,

291
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,000
not only do they fight harder for what

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
they want, they also want more to begin

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,640
with. And if you don't relate with this

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,680
behavior pattern, it's just a matter of

295
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,480
turning on your hormone engine. Until

296
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,560
you do, you don't truly know what it is

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
that you are capable of. By the way,

298
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,000
it's not just necessarily competition

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,160
that boosts testosterone. Collaboration

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,760
also boosts testosterone just as well.

301
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
In fact, I would say that the ideal case

302
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,560
is belonging to a collaborative group

303
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,800
that is in competition with other

304
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
groups. So this could be in a sports

305
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,720
setting where you are in a team who is

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,959
competing against other teams or even in

307
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,560
a military setting. Collaboration for

308
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
the sake of competition is the greatest

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,440
social game possible. So find your tribe

310
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,160
and then defeat other tribes. A tale as

311
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,640
old as time. Build a business. In that

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,200
process, you will build a team and

313
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,519
together you are competing against other

314
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
businesses. Of course, building a

315
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,640
business is just one example. The key

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,839
here is to find something that you can

317
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
actually see yourself doing and

318
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,800
enjoying. Here's the easiest way to do

319
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,360
it. Just join any fitness community. And

320
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
running, dancing, climbing, skating,

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,640
table tennis, chess, could literally be

322
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
any of these things. It doesn't matter.

323
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
And if you can't think of anything, all

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
that means is you got to try things

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
until something clicks. Your health

326
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,519
depends on it. Collaboration and

327
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,800
competition are the best testosterone

328
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
supplement. I've already mentioned that

329
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
testosterone makes effort feel good. But

330
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
the question is, how do you leverage

331
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,560
this? It comes down to how the body

332
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
interprets a stressor. The same person

333
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,480
who's afraid of heights might

334
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
voluntarily get into a roller coaster.

335
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
The crazy thing is the brain activation

336
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,680
pattern in both cases would be the exact

337
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,399
same. That is to say, excitement and

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,120
terror have the same activation pattern

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,839
in the brain, except of course for one

340
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,120
key brain area, the amygdala. The

341
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,200
amydala maintains the stress threshold.

342
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,240
That is the amydala decides whether a

343
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,680
stress is excitement or if it's terror.

344
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
And guess where the highest

345
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,680
concentration of testosterone receptors

346
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,839
in the brain is? The amygdala. If

347
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,880
testosterone is high, the amygdala

348
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,480
increases this stress threshold, meaning

349
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,440
that you need to be in a really, really

350
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,920
bad situation in order to feel stressed.

351
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,560
If testosterone is low, then the stress

352
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,000
threshold is low. So, even a mundane

353
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,600
stress would feel terrifying. Naturally,

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
higher testosterone means that you're

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,959
likely to take more risks and do cool

356
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,880
[ __ ] because you're no longer afraid.

357
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,040
Here's the paradox. Testosterone causes

358
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,079
you to pursue more pain in search of

359
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,399
reward, but also dulls the pain. So, it

360
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,000
is the case that you can endure more,

361
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
but it doesn't even feel like you're

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
enduring more because it almost becomes

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,720
fun. So, Tim Ferrris has this question

364
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,880
that he likes to ask when he's

365
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,360
confronted with a difficulty. What would

366
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
this look like if it was easy? The

367
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
question I prefer to ask is, what would

368
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,279
this look like if it was fun? It's a

369
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,200
very powerful question to ask if you are

370
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,959
an entrepreneur or a pre-ontrepreneur.

371
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,680
But it's not so simple because in this

372
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,560
mechanism we see another feedback loop.

373
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,040
Testosterone causes action and action

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,920
causes victory and victory generates

375
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,560
testosterone. But also low testosterone

376
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,959
causes fear. Fear causes inaction,

377
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,519
inaction causes failure and failure

378
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,399
leads to low testosterone. It's one of

379
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,519
those things where to he who has more

380
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
will be given and to he who has not more

381
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
will be taken. This is a vicious cycle

382
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,800
that exists and must be broken out of by

383
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
force. To do this, you need action and

384
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,480
you need knowledge. So, let's get into

385
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,000
the tactical stuff. What biomarkers

386
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,720
would you need to get tested to see if

387
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
your health is on track as a man? For

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,000
testosterone, we would need at least two

389
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,040
metrics. Total testosterone and free

390
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,600
testosterone. Most of the testosterone

391
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,760
in your body is not freely floating.

392
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
It's not in an activated state. In fact,

393
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,920
only 2% of the total testosterone is

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,199
freely available. And that's ballpark

395
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,240
numbers. Obviously, the rest of

396
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,880
testosterone is bound tightly to SHBG,

397
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,519
which is the spherical protein, which is

398
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,279
sex hormone binding globbulin. As the

399
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,880
name suggests, it doesn't just bind to

400
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,399
testosterone. It binds to all sex

401
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,880
hormones like DHT and to a lesser extent

402
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,920
estrogen. To be clear, SHBG is not the

403
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,839
enemy. It's not that SHBG is trapping

404
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,079
the testosterone and preventing it from

405
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,320
acting. It's actually a transporter.

406
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,399
It's a wonderful molecule. In fact, we

407
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,480
need SHBG to transport the testosterone

408
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
across the bloodb brain barrier in the

409
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,519
in the brain to carry out its functions

410
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,839
on the amygdala. However, stress,

411
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,120
xenoestrogen exposure, or heavy metal

412
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,120
toxicity can cause SHBG to bind to too

413
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
much testosterone. If your free

414
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,839
testosterone is less than 2%, then you

415
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
need to take action to start liberating

416
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,320
this bound testosterone. So, what can

417
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,839
you do? Boron supplementation can help

418
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
with this. Just make sure that you pair

419
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
the boron with iodine because boron is a

420
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
grogen. Quick note, if you're trying to

421
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,480
calculate the percent of free

422
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,920
testosterone in your lab report, here's

423
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
something that you'll run into. Because

424
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
the concentration of total testosterone

425
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
is so much greater than that of free

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,920
testosterone, most lab reports will

427
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,120
report the scores in different units.

428
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
So, make sure you do your unit

429
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,079
conversion correctly before you

430
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,959
calculate a percentage. Another useful

431
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,880
biioarker to get would be SHBG itself.

432
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,440
If you're in the 55ish range, you're

433
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,160
good. If not, then SHBG optimization

434
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,959
comes first. SHBG is downstream of

435
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,800
insulin, estradiol, and thyroid. So,

436
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,120
you'd want to look at those biomarkers

437
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,440
first for clues. Now, the thing is

438
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120
testosterone on its own doesn't tell us

439
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,600
much about the overall health of the

440
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
body. It's actually a lagging indicator.

441
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,160
So, I have created a custom blood work

442
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,000
panel of more than 52 biomarkers

443
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,160
including testosterone and free

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
testosterone through our industry

445
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
partner, Alta Labs. I have linked this

446
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
in the description. It's the most

447
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
cost-effective panel of its kind. You

448
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
can verify this for yourself, but

449
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,560
unfortunately it's only available in the

450
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
US. If you join Crusade Cohort,

451
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,759
interpretations of these blood tests

452
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,199
will be included as a part of your

453
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,600
membership. I will personally go through

454
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,600
your results with you. Now, what gives

455
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
me the credibility to do this? I'm not a

456
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,880
medical professional, but I do hold a

457
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
certification in functional blood

458
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
chemistry. Now, let's get back to the

459
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,600
big question. What testosterone range

460
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,600
should you aim for? Here's my stance.

461
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,360
Don't aim for a number. Aim for a

462
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,640
percentage increase. The reason I say

463
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,439
it's better to aim for a percentage

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,520
increase rather than a number to hit is

465
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,160
because everybody's receptor sensitivity

466
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
is different. So, one man's 400 might

467
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,600
actually beat another man's 600. So,

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
what are some benchmarks? There are no

469
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,799
standard industry benchmarks for men who

470
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,839
are trying to actively increase their

471
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,520
testosterone. What I can share with you

472
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,520
is what I've seen from my own practice.

473
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
If you're below 200, you can see the

474
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
biggest boost. you can actually get a 2x

475
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
increase in testosterone just because

476
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
there's more room to grow. Right? If

477
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,760
you're in the middle range of 200 to 600

478
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,559
nanogs per deciliter, you can expect to

479
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,120
see a 50 to 100% increase. If you're

480
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,840
already above 600, you're already doing

481
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,360
great. You can aim for a 20 to 50%

482
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,880
increase. I will of course share with

483
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,240
you the tactical advice on how to do

484
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,320
this, but first a word from our

485
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,600
sponsors. Me, I'm the sponsor. So, I'll

486
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
keep this quite short and I'll keep this

487
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,440
to the point. I am a specialist in only

488
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
one thing. I specialize in getting guys

489
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,280
out of a rut to move them towards their

490
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,120
dream goals. This is my full-time job. I

491
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,200
love doing it. I've gotten quite good at

492
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,400
it. I've helped more than 10 guys just

493
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
like you achieved their dream

494
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
transformation in just 110 days. This

495
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,200
was me right after surgery. I had lost a

496
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,520
lot of muscle over the 2 years. I was

497
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,799
determined to get it back. And this was

498
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,120
me after joining cohort zero. I have a

499
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,360
long ways to go, no doubt about that.

500
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,080
But I have the systems to ensure my

501
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,760
success. Alex had one goal. He wanted to

502
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
join the army, but they would not let

503
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,080
him because he was overweight. 3 months

504
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,960
into cohort zero and he's reached the

505
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,200
lowest weight he's had in 5 years. Jaden

506
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,919
had one goal. He wanted to get strong.

507
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,400
In 3 months, he won gold in his

508
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,480
powerlifting competition. Kuba had two

509
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
goals. To overcome his binge eating

510
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
habits and to start a business. 3 months

511
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
into cohort zero and he's in the shape

512
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,840
of his life and just signed his first

513
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,400
three clients. Now cohort zero has just

514
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,080
ended, but cohort 1 is under

515
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
construction. If you're a man with big

516
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
dreams, then I can help you make these

517
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,320
dreams into a reality. Applications to

518
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
cohort 1 close in about 5 days at the

519
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,760
time of this recording. I'd also say

520
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,760
that 50% of the slots have already been

521
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,760
claimed during the pre-launch, but not

522
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
to worry, this is not a first come,

523
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,520
first- serve basis. This is based on

524
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,360
fit. I will link to my website in the

525
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
description. There's a short video on

526
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
there that explains the mechanism of how

527
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
this all works. You could potentially

528
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,120
take that mechanism and try to apply it

529
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
by yourself. That's fine by me.

530
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,400
Transformation is what I'm after. It

531
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,400
contains some very interesting

532
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,799
frameworks that are outside the scope of

533
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,280
this video. It describes the interesting

534
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,120
and very important interaction of the

535
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
hormone profile with the big five

536
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
personality traits. This is the cutting

537
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,480
edge of my research. So, you're going to

538
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
want to watch this to get a sneak peek

539
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
of what's coming to give you that

540
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,000
massive advantage. Now, let's get back

541
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,760
into tactics. So, when it comes to the

542
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,200
high leverage action steps to increase

543
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,360
testosterone, what do you need to do? I

544
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,919
asked this question to you, my audience,

545
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,120
and you answered correctly. Basically,

546
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,640
it's three things: recovery, exercise,

547
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,559
and nutrition. If you think I'm going to

548
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,559
give you some crazy new hack like icing

549
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,799
your ball sack or taking some scam

550
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,720
supplement, then you are going to be

551
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,559
disappointed. The hardcore truth that

552
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,039
nobody wants to hear is there's only

553
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,880
three big levers on testosterone. It's

554
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,559
nutrition, exercise, and recovery. Then

555
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
you have three smaller levers, which is

556
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,880
sunlight, social status, and sexual

557
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,080
success. If you're expecting some kind

558
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,000
of crazy esoteric hack method, then you

559
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,480
are looking for entertainment and not

560
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,799
outcomes. On this channel, there is no

561
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,440
entertainment. There's only outcomes.

562
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,280
Excellence is the fundamentals done a

563
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
thousand times. That's what we care

564
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
about. That's what I care about. And

565
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,400
that's what you should care about as

566
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,720
well. But then again, if it was so

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,480
simple, then why do so many men not have

568
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
the results? Why do they not have the

569
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
energy, the physique, and the sex drive

570
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,440
that they want? There is a secret hiding

571
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,000
in plain sight that I will now reveal. I

572
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,559
have drawn a triangle of health on this

573
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
piece of paper. Exercise, nutrition, and

574
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,600
recovery. Now, I have a question for

575
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,000
you. How many elements make up this

576
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,559
system? Think about it for a second. If

577
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,600
you answered three, you are mistaken.

578
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,679
There are six. Health is a system and

579
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,000
each of these connections two is a part

580
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,760
of the system. Each of these big three

581
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,760
interact and co-interact with each

582
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
other. If you add in the small three,

583
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,679
quickly it becomes a web. And this is

584
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,159
the web that men will find themselves

585
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,400
stuck in. The elements of health are

586
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
simple, but the interactions are

587
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,840
complex. Let me give you a real life

588
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,840
example to drive this point home.

589
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
Imagine a normal guy who looks a little

590
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,159
bit chubby as he gets to his 30s. He

591
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,919
cannot any longer see his abs and the

592
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
girls aren't checking him out as much as

593
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
they did when he was in college. So,

594
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
what he wants to do is quite

595
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
straightforward. He wants to lose some

596
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,720
fat. He wants to gain some muscle. He

597
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
wants to get back to his college

598
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,200
physique. Great. So, he starts going to

599
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
the gym. And what does he find? He finds

600
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
that he's hitting the weights. He's

601
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,039
putting in the reps, but doesn't look

602
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,360
any better week after week. What he

603
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,360
doesn't realize is that his increased

604
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,240
calorie burn is actually causing him to

605
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,440
snack more. So his benefits of his

606
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,200
exercise interact with his nutrition and

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
not in a good way. In the end, he

608
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,480
doesn't lose any fat because the

609
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,120
benefits of exercise are counterbalanced

610
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,600
by his downfall in nutrition. Learning

611
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,600
from this, our guy says, "Okay, let's

612
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,840
start with the diet instead." Now he

613
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,919
cuts his calorie intake, but this tanks

614
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
his metabolic rate. Now his baseline

615
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,640
metabolic rate is low. It doesn't have

616
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,559
the energy anymore to exercise. Now he's

617
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,799
feeling stuck, feeling like [ __ ] So he

618
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,120
goes back to his old habits. They say

619
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,480
old habits die hard. But why is this?

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,080
It's because old habits have a feedback

621
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,400
loop. Now the third time he tries to

622
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,880
combine exercise and diet, but the

623
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,120
stress from his lifestyle change is

624
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
causing effects on his sleep. And we

625
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,919
know that fat is lost when you sleep.

626
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,240
Muscle is gained when you sleep. So it

627
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,559
ends up just looking more or less the

628
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,880
same. week after week and he gives up

629
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,360
assuming that he is too old to make any

630
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
substantial change in his life. Now this

631
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,440
story is a hypothetical right? It sounds

632
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,000
like a hypothetical because it is. But

633
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,120
some variation of this story is what's

634
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
keeping you stuck and that is not a

635
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,840
hypothetical. Some feedback loop is

636
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,760
responsible for keeping you where you

637
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,600
are. This goes beyond fitness by the

638
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,960
way. There are feedback loops that are

639
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,240
keeping your bank account looking

640
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,840
exactly what it's looking like. There

641
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,840
are feedback loops that are keeping you

642
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,480
single. I'm serious. So think about

643
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
this. If you are stuck at anything in

644
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
life, it means that there's a positive

645
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,440
feedback loop which is keeping you

646
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,799
there. If you're a guy who's bad with

647
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
women, probably means that you have a

648
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,200
mindset that's making you bad with women

649
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,440
and your being bad with women reinforces

650
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,280
that mindset. So this is an example of

651
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,280
course of another feedback loop that

652
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,960
keeps you stuck where you are. So

653
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,480
whenever you are stuck, you must

654
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,159
investigate the system structure. So the

655
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,799
solution of course to something like

656
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,159
this would be a systemsbased approach

657
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,280
which just so happens to be my

658
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,799
specialty. Going back to that

659
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,480
hypothetical which I constructed out of

660
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
nowhere, if you are that chubby guy

661
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
who's trying to lose some life chub,

662
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,000
you'd have to focus on recovery to blunt

663
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
the cortisol spikes. You'd have to focus

664
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
on hypertrophy to blunt the insulin

665
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
spikes. You'd have to focus on stress

666
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,720
management to blunt the epinephrine

667
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,880
spikes. You'd have to focus on

668
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,360
consistency to blunt the dopamine

669
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,000
spikes. Hard to say spike so many times,

670
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,600
boys. If it seems complex, it doesn't

671
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,320
have to be. You just need the right

672
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,159
systems. First, like I said, boys,

673
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
sleep. It's when you sleep that

674
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,159
testosterone is produced, when muscle

675
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,159
growth happens, and when growth hormone

676
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,240
is released. Sleep is when fat loss

677
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
happens. Sleep is when your body height

678
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,159
increases, assuming you're in the right

679
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,000
age for this. Sleep is when you cash in

680
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,000
the efforts made during the day. If you

681
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
don't get good quality sleep, 8 to nine

682
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,840
hours, you're basically deciding to

683
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
forego the rewards from the effort that

684
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,520
you made during the day. Yes, sleep

685
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,000
optimization is a big topic, but let's

686
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,080
hit it with the big five analysis. The

687
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
big five rule states that 90% of the

688
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,840
results come from the top three actions.

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,559
So, what are the top three actions that

690
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,400
lead to good sleep? Action one is the

691
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
light environment. You need to fix the

692
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,679
light environment if you're going to get

693
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,240
good sleep. So, how do you do this? You

694
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,840
are going to wear a silk sleep mask when

695
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,279
you sleep. This will keep out the light

696
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
from your eyes. Second is to get

697
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,720
yourself these blue light blockers. Now,

698
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
I'm not an affiliate. I don't make any

699
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,240
money by promoting this company, but I

700
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,720
found a lot of benefit from having

701
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,520
these. So, not all blue light blockers

702
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,799
are created equal. And this is the final

703
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,480
boss of blue light blockers. Yes, it

704
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,159
looks weird. Yes, it looks like

705
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,159
something out of Mission Impossible. No,

706
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,360
I would not wear it in public. But it

707
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,200
works. It's shaped in this weird way and

708
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,440
it's shaped such that light doesn't get

709
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
in from the sides and it's super dark

710
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,720
tinted and it's completely red so

711
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,559
nothing but red wavelengths get through.

712
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,559
High leverage investment. Shout out to

713
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,559
Elijah from the Austin Growth House for

714
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,240
putting me on these. Now the third is

715
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,000
optional though recommended is to get

716
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,080
programmable lights in your home like

717
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,679
like the Philips Hue lights. And what

718
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
these will do is you can program them to

719
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,760
turn red at a time that you set. So I've

720
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,360
set mine to turn red at 6 p.m. Works

721
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,159
great. reminds me that I need to stop

722
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,320
working to wind down and focus on

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,760
recovery mode. Action number two,

724
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,679
nutrition. No food 3 hours prior to bed.

725
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,799
Food right before sleeping messes with

726
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,559
recovery. Also, I would say no water 3

727
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,559
hours prior to bed. Now, this is not an

728
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,039
exact science, but it helps me because

729
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,440
if because if I don't follow this rule,

730
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,960
I almost always end up waking up to go

731
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,919
to the bathroom. And I hate this because

732
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,400
it disrupts my sleep, right? So, food

733
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
and water. You need to increase the time

734
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
between you consume food and water and

735
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,000
your actual bedtime to improve your

736
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,919
recovery. Action number three,

737
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,919
temperature. Take a quick shower before

738
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,000
you sleep. It can literally be less than

739
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,320
60 seconds. Hell, it can be just 30

740
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
seconds. Just expose yourself to water.

741
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
You don't even have to, you know, use

742
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
soap and shampoo and do a whole hygiene

743
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,200
routine. This is not for hygiene. It's

744
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,720
more so for the body temperature reset.

745
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
It's a thermal reset. So, you've

746
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,679
probably heard this before that you need

747
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,320
your body temperature to cool down for

748
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,919
better recovery during sleep. Powerful.

749
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,760
All you got to do is step into the

750
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
shower, blast yourself with cold water,

751
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,120
and doesn't have to be actually cold

752
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,120
water. It can actually be a warm shower

753
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,760
as well because regardless of hot shower

754
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
or cold shower, the t the the surface of

755
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,960
the body will actually lose heat through

756
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,440
evaporation of the water. So, this will

757
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,039
cause a cascade of blood flow changes

758
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
that will allow your body to quickly

759
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,799
adapt and change its state. So hear me

760
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
out and understand this carefully. A

761
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,080
shower, no matter what the temperature

762
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
is, allows you to be more adaptable

763
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,880
thermally. So either from wakeful to

764
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,960
sleepy or sleepy to wakeful. So I

765
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,039
actually take two quick showers during

766
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,080
the day. One in the morning to go from

767
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,360
sleepy to alert and once an hour prior

768
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,799
to bed to go from alert to sleepy. If

769
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,640
you implement just these three

770
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,880
techniques, you're going to achieve 90%

771
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,279
of sleep optimization. In the cohorts,

772
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,919
how we implement sleep optimization at

773
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,919
the expert level is by giving everybody

774
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,080
an aura ring. This way I have

775
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,960
minuteby-minute control or I should say

776
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,039
access to your bio data. Pair the fact

777
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,360
that in the cohort I have access also to

778
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,600
your nutrition and your exercise. Using

779
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,360
this I can triangulate the perfect

780
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,440
health transformation for you. Now going

781
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,760
to the third key aspect of health which

782
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
is exercise. There's research that shows

783
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,080
that lifting heavy in the five to eight

784
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
rep range can boost testosterone

785
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,600
receptor sensitivity. There's also

786
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
research showing that I don't give a

787
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,159
[ __ ] The truth is doesn't matter. The

788
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,720
only thing that matters is intensity,

789
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,559
progressive overload and consistency. So

790
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,799
consistency is a real king because you

791
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,799
can train intensity and progression. You

792
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,120
first build consistency. And where does

793
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,000
consistency come from? Consistency is

794
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,840
downstream of enjoyment. So find a

795
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
workout style that works for you and

796
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,720
just stick with that. The best training

797
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,799
modality is the one which you enjoy.

798
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,960
Make it fun, make it social, make it

799
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,960
intense. Personally, the gym, just

800
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,559
standard weightlifting makes the most

801
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
sense for me because I can see the

802
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,520
fastest results. The past 2 years have

803
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,480
been difficult time for me health-wise.

804
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,120
I took two joint injuries back in 2022

805
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,399
at the end of 2022 and my health issues

806
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,919
flared up out of nowhere in 2023. had

807
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,440
severe breathing issues to the point I

808
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,600
couldn't even breathe with my nose at

809
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,039
all. The most I could do in the gym

810
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,720
because I was completely out of energy,

811
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,039
my testosterone profile was destroyed,

812
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
my hormone profile was destroyed, was

813
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,039
maybe 10 to 20 minutes on the treadmill.

814
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,799
Then I had to get surgery done which

815
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,720
again put me out of the gym because of

816
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,399
course if you lift weights after a

817
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,559
surgery you can rupture blood vessels.

818
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,039
Now the final aspect of health which is

819
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,880
nutrition. Now this can be a huge topic.

820
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,080
We can talk about the gut microbiome. We

821
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,399
can talk about parasites. We can talk

822
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,240
about so much more. But this would be

823
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,320
its own course. Instead, I will focus

824
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
again on using the big three rule. So,

825
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,120
what's the big three on nutrition?

826
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Number one is to avoid seed oils. This

827
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,200
rule automatically changes food choices.

828
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,039
It means that you choose the grilled

829
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,039
chicken at Chick-fil-A instead of the

830
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,399
fried. See, you don't have to be rigid

831
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,520
with this. Right now, I'm not saying

832
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,039
Chick-fil-A is where you should go to

833
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
get healthy food. I'm just saying that

834
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,240
if you're going out as well, you can

835
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
make better choices. This is one of

836
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,880
those high leverage rules that have huge

837
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
downstream effects. Now, you may not be

838
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,480
able to eliminate seed oils completely,

839
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,799
but you don't have to. You don't need

840
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,159
perfection to see results. Just need to

841
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,320
aim at minimization. Simple rule, high

842
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,039
leverage. The second rule, rule number

843
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,440
two is the carrot and egg rule. I used

844
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,600
to have this habit of snacking a lot

845
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,279
between meals. If I'm doing research for

846
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,440
a video or working on business, whenever

847
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,600
I get stuck on something, whenever I get

848
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,679
frustrated, I would make a beline to the

849
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
fridge to grab something. Now, I've

850
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,520
tried using discipline and willpower to

851
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,279
stop this behavior. But I always had

852
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,440
mixed results. Now, I have this simple

853
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,000
rule that I always follow, which is I

854
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,159
can snack anytime I want. No guilt

855
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
associated, but I can only snack on

856
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,320
carrots or boiled eggs. Now, I like

857
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,240
carrots and boiled eggs, but they aren't

858
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,480
addicting in the same way as packaged

859
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
goods generally are. Besides, it's

860
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
nutritious. You can't go wrong with

861
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,440
eating too many eggs or carrots. Well, I

862
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,200
mean, you can, but that's very unlikely.

863
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,360
Carrots will bind to toxins and remove

864
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
them from your body. Eggs, of course,

865
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,080
are eggs are amazing. Eggs are nutrition

866
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,480
grenades. So, simple rule, high

867
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,640
leverage. Rule number three, chew your

868
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,080
food completely before swallowing. This

869
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,240
is an interesting one because it has

870
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,840
immediate as well as long-term effects.

871
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,120
In the short term, chewing your food

872
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,120
longer and waiting for it to be

873
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,200
completely mushed before swallowing it

874
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,880
aids in digestion and of course the

875
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,880
nutrition absorption, meaning that

876
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,039
you're going to get more nutrition per

877
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,720
volume of food that you consume. But the

878
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,559
long-term benefits are actually the

879
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,360
biggest lever. If you chew your food

880
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,279
fully, you will reveal the full flavor

881
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
profile of that food that you're eating.

882
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,200
It means that unhealthy food of any

883
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
kind, packaged goods or if it's fast

884
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,080
food, whatever, will lose its appeal to

885
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,679
you. Why? Because as you are chewing

886
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,480
this food completely, you're giving your

887
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,320
taste buds the time to actually examine

888
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,559
what's in the food. So foods that's

889
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,440
engineered to be nutritious by adding

890
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,039
MSG will no longer be able to play that

891
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,640
trick on you because your sense of taste

892
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,480
is actually quite good. It just needs

893
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,919
time to fully absorb and give that

894
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,640
information to the brain. Giving your

895
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,559
taste buds time to assess the food makes

896
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,640
the food taste bad if it's unhealthy

897
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,399
food. And at the same time, actual whole

898
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,120
foods like steak and potatoes will not

899
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,039
decay in taste as you chew. In fact, new

900
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,039
flavors will be unlocked. This single

901
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,880
rule will lead to lifelong changes in

902
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,799
decision-m. I want to mention this

903
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,840
before we close out. The knowledge of

904
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,360
these tactics are useless without

905
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,600
implementation. Put these to work. Make

906
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,240
the sacrifices. If you don't sacrifice

907
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,960
for your dreams, your dreams will become

908
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,960
the sacrifice.
