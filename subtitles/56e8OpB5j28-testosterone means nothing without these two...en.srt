1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
The pituitary produces luteinizing

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,879
hormone LH and follical stimulating

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,720
hormone

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,320
FH. These are the hormones that tell

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
your balls to start producing

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
testosterone and sperm. Damage to the

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
pituitary can permanently kill off

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
testosterone production. If you're doing

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
boxing, try to avoid hard sparring where

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,359
you're taking knocks to the head, unless

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,119
you're purposely building up to a fight,

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
in which case, of course, all bets are

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,720
off. You can do everything right, but if

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
your pituitary is getting rocked, it's

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
game over. However, there's many jobs

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
that involve a lot of shocks to the

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
head. If you operate a jackhammer for

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,079
your job, it's a lot of vibration

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
traveling up to your brain pan. Another

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
example is if you're in the military and

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,079
operate heavy weapons like the 50 cal or

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
worse, the shouldermounted weapons like

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
the Gustav. We know that this is

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
terrible for the brain. If you're in

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,239
construction, military or martial arts,

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,280
neck training is a non-negotiable along

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,559
with good hearing

28
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,320
protection. If you're overweight, you

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,640
need to reverse this. You need to get to

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
a sustainable 15% body fat. So, what

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
does 15% body fat look like? Just means

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
that you can see your abs if you flex

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
and have good lighting. It's not even

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
that hard to get except that it is. It

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
is hard to get if you're already

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
overweight because you're working

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
against a powerful feedback loop. So,

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,000
let me explain. If you already have a

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,479
bunch of fat tissue on your body, this

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,799
fat tissue is producing aromatase.

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
Aromatase converts testosterone to

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
estrogen. Here's the kicker. More

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,360
estrogen causes you to store more fat

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
and therefore create more aromatase. So

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,560
you're in this vicious cycle that's

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,960
keeping you fat. That being said, you

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,759
can also create a virtuous cycle to

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,920
combat this. Hormone optimized training

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,880
will lead to muscle growth and this new

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,640
muscle will act as a glucose reservoir.

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Why is this important? It's important

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
because this will dampen the insulin

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,479
spikes and if the insulin spikes are

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,600
dampened then the food cravings will

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,280
reduce. overall calorie intake will

56
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,119
reduce. Yes, it is true that most people

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
who go through a weight loss or fat loss

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,079
program regain the fat and actually

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,840
exceed the baseline, get even fatter.

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
However, that's because most fat loss

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
programs do not have a fundamental

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,399
understanding of the underlying biology

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,399
and the hormone

64
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,000
engine. Don't drink beer or smoke weed.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
If you want to drink, drink wine like

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,319
the ancients did. Modern beer is fake

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
and gay. If you're going to smoke, don't

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
smoke weed. Smoke tobacco like a man. At

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
least the nicotine is going to make you

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
sharp and alert. Great industries and

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
empires have been built on wine and

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,879
tobacco. Nothing has been built from

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
beer and weed. Now, how much do you

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
drink? Personally, I don't go more than

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,319
two to three glasses of wine per week,

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
and that's only on social occasions. You

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,959
can absolutely have fun in a social

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,120
setting without alcohol. Don't ever feel

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
that you are obligated to partake

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,040
because other people around you are

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,120
drinking. In fact, the ability to reject

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,640
peer pressure is a sign of a strong

83
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,800
man. Don't be afraid to ask for

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,720
non-toxic options. If you go to

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Starbucks and you ask them to use a mug,

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
like an actual ceramic mug, they will.

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
It's just a matter of asking. In fact,

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
this is something you need to practice.

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,800
At sitdown restaurants, you can ask them

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
to prepare your food in butter rather

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
than oil. Now, don't say seed oils

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,159
because they probably don't know what

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760
that means. Just ask to have your food

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
prepared in butter. This will be

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
socially awkward or socially challenging

96
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,400
if you haven't done this before, but you

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
need to get used to having your way. I

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
want you to behave in such a way that

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
you expect the best service. Ask for the

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,680
non-toxic options. Let the normies eat

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
the slop. You could instead insist on

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,400
preserving your health. Be that guy. Be

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,400
the leader. Teach your body that you are

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
that guy and soon you will
