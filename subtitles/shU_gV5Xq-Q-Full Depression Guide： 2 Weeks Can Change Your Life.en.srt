1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,319
Jeffrey wakes up. He's already late to

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,040
school. But he grabs his phone.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,120
Jeffrey's depressed. Is this all there

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
is to life? Just go to school, go to

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,719
work, and then die? Isn't there someone

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
who can show Jeffree a better way?

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,880
Adonis.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,119
Adonis takes Jeffrey under his wing and

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,760
shows him the ultimate life for young

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
men. He teleports him to Barley,

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
surrounded by other masculine men.

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,960
They're lifting weights. They're talking

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,119
to girls. They're eating good food. He

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,520
lives in a beautiful villa. He drives a

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,520
motorbike. He makes money online. You

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
can achieve this, Jeffrey. There's a

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
whole world out here just waiting for

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
you to take life by the horns. Poof.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? We're back

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,879
in Jeffrey's room. Was it all a dream?

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
Did that actually happen? Oh, Jeffrey's

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
going to slump back into his old ways,

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
isn't he? Wait, what is he doing? He's

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,160
writing something down on a piece of

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,160
paper. He's sticking that paper onto his

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
wall. What does it say? For the first

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,080
time in Jeffrey's life, he wrote down

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,799
his goals. He smiles and gets to work.

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
One day, when I was 10 years old, me and

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,479
my brother wake up early and we sneak

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479
downstairs to play our favorite game,

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,880
Runescape. We're not allowed to play

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,920
video games in the home cuz my dad tells

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,600
us not to. But my mom lets us. But since

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,680
it's a Sunday and he's not working

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
today, me and my brother have this habit

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
where every Sunday we wake up early, we

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
grab our walkietalkies and one of us

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,840
stands near the stairs just hearing out

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
for the noises that my dad might make if

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
he wakes up whilst the other one plays

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,159
the this video game like on the computer

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
for like 5 minutes at a time and then we

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
switch and switch and switch. I was

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
addicted to this game. It's kind of like

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,360
an MMO RPG. You have like a character in

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,759
this virtual world and you can literally

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,840
play this game for thousands of hours

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,840
without completing it. So that's what I

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:03,680
did. Age 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,240
Every day, hours and hours and hours

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,920
just put into the virtual world. I'm sat

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,760
there with pizza, Doritos,

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,239
Lucasade, like Mountain Dew, energy

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
drinks, brownies, and chocolates, just

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
eating and playing. Whilst all the kids

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
are learning to socialize and be

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,959
confident with girls and going to sports

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,480
clubs, every day I'm just playing video

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
games, eating junk food, and watching

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
porn and jacking off two, three times

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
every single day through my teenage

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,239
years. I get to 18, 19, 20 years old,

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,920
eating junk food, like the unhealthiest

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
food, you know, the from the takeaway

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,599
where it's fried chicken with this

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
greasy sauce or it's from the

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,519
supermarket, these bags of cookies,

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,080
staying up late drinking. Eventually, I

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,599
start smoking weed every single day,

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
which of course, weed is the perfect

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,519
companion to the life I was already

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
living, playing video games every day.

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
By this point, I'm playing like Fortnite

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
with my roommates. We're smoking every

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
day. We're drinking two, three, four

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,599
times a week. were eating junk food. My

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,280
entire teenage years and early adult

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,680
years were just spent consuming. It went

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,599
from being so fun and so wholesome, like

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
sneaking downstairs with my brother to

82
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,440
play this video game, like 5 minutes

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
each, to eventually me just being like a

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,640
21-year-old

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,120
loser. I didn't take life seriously.

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,239
What was once fun

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,760
turns into mundanity,

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
boredom,

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
depression. Whilst other kids were

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
taking life seriously and studying and

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
working hard, I was just grinding in the

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,760
virtual world. And so when I get to

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,159
about 21, 22 years old, I find myself

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,879
just working my first ever full-time

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:49,519
job. And I hate my life. This one day, I

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,000
wake up sleepd deprived as always. get

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,720
ready for work, put on my tie, walk out,

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,720
and it's cold and dark and miserable. I

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
get onto the tram, like the public

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
transport, and there's almost no one on

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
there. There's like one other guy on the

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040
other side wearing like a high viz vest.

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
He's going to work early in the morning

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
as well. It goes through the city. I'm

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
cold, listening to my music, almost like

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
shivering, wearing my jacket. I've got

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,840
another 20 minute walk in like these

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
work shoes. get to the office, sign in

109
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
on the computer, say hello to my

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
co-workers who I've got nothing in

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,840
common with, and just do this mindless

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,919
work for the next eight hours, 9 hours

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,880
actually, because I have a 1 hour unpaid

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,800
lunch break. Finish work at 6:00 p.m.

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,360
The entire day is basically gone, and

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
I've made like £64.

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
Never mind the price of lunch and the

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
commute and everything. I've profited

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,680
like £55 today for an entire day of my

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
life. 20 minute walk to the tram and I'm

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
gonna walk fast because if I get there

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
just fast enough I might get the earlier

123
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,919
tram home but I I see it leave and I've

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
got to wait 12 minutes for the next one

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,639
and it's only 12 minutes but it's

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
[ __ ] like it feels so long. Wait the

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
12 minutes. The next tram comes it's

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,040
packed of everyone who's going home

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,400
after work. Everyone's just kind of

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,479
depressed. Every now and then there's

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,240
like a random [ __ ] angry crackhead

132
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,479
just being loud or whatever. You feel so

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
uncomfortable. I get off at my stop.

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,840
It's already dark outside. I've

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
basically not even seen the sun today.

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,199
Walk down the stairs. choose the

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,199
shortcut to get to my apartment

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,039
building. The shortcut's like kind of

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
undeveloped. There's no street lamps.

140
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,400
So, you have to use the flashlight on

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
your phone to be able to see the floor

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,880
cuz it's completely dark. I'm using the

143
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,800
flashlight

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to walk over to my apartment. I can see

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,520
it in the distance and I am so

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
miserable.

147
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,120
I can't believe this is what life is

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
like. When you're young and you're in

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
school, you you know, you you feel like

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,680
it's going to last forever. the school

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
mindset, who you have a crush on, who

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
you're going to hang out with today,

153
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
what you're going to watch when you get

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
home. But when you become an adult, when

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,759
you grow up and you realize this is what

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,800
life is, it's miserable.

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,000
And so I go on my phone and I turn the

158
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,400
flashlight off. So I'm just in complete

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,320
darkness outside, like on this random

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,600
street. It's completely dark, like you

161
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,080
can barely see anything.

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,240
And I just start crying.

163
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,000
This is what life is. I'm depressed

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,880
and

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,880
it's my fault.

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,039
All those years when I was younger that

167
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,039
I was just playing video games and not

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
taking life seriously and just watching

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,840
porn and eating junk food, what I was

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,600
doing with all those bad habits was I

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,919
was stealing happiness from tomorrow.

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
That's the new view of depression that I

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,960
want you to have. The view, the idea of

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
depression that we've gotten from the

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
pharmaceutical companies and the

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
medicine and all this [ __ ]

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,800
modern-day world, the idea is that

178
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,039
depression is kind of this disease that

179
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,639
can strike you at once and you're just

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,800
stuck with it and you have to take these

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,840
pills. I'm here to tell you that that is

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,759
a complete and utter lie. It's from

183
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,160
companies that want to profit from your

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
misery. It doesn't even work. Everyone

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
believes these days that depression is

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
this random disease and I'm depressed

187
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,639
and I need to take this medication and

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
this and this and this and it doesn't

189
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
[ __ ] work. People who are depressed

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,400
stay depressed forever. So, I'm going to

191
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,360
tell you a better mindset, a better view

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,520
with depression. If you are depressed,

193
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,720
it's because you deserve it. It's

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
because you have done so much of the

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,840
instant gratification habits, the bad

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
habits like porn and video games and

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,120
junk food and staying up late. You've

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,199
done so many of those bad habits. Each

199
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
one of those bad habits steals happiness

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,400
from tomorrow. And when you keep doing

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
them, you stole so much happiness from

202
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
tomorrow that then you wake up and you

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
feel depressed. Instant gratification is

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
the word that you need to understand to

205
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
cure your depression. Instant

206
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,919
gratification basically just refers to

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,319
the things that we do that feel good

208
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,160
right now, but they steal happiness

209
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,560
tomorrow. Like junk food. Junk food

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
tastes nice right now, but then tomorrow

211
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
you feel kind of depressed because you

212
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
ate the [ __ ] food. You feel worse. your

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
stomach kind of hurts and you've gained

214
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,360
some fat. Porn. Porn feels good when we

215
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
watch it right now. It's like

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
stimulating. But the moment you get the

217
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
postnut clarity, it feels bad and it's

218
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,520
like we were up here. Porn makes us go a

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,919
bit higher. It feels good and

220
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
stimulating. But after we're done, we're

221
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,919
lower than the baseline that we started

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,520
at last time. On a short-term basis, if

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
we just take some junk food or play some

224
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
video games or watch some porn, our life

225
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
goes up a little bit, but then it goes

226
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,560
down lower than the baseline. But then

227
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,120
if you do this every day, the baseline

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,919
just keeps going lower and lower and

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,919
lower and lower. And that's the feeling

230
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,519
of depression. When you feel depressed,

231
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,279
it's because you have done so many of

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
these bad habits that you've just

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
lowered the baseline of your happiness

234
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,560
so much to now that you look into the

235
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
mirror and you're like, "Damn, I look

236
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,839
like [ __ ] I feel like [ __ ] I've had a

237
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
stomach ache for like 3 days straight. I

238
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
get headaches like twice a week. I've

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,760
been getting bad grades in school. I

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,760
have no future prospects with my career

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,279
or with a business. My physique looks

242
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
like [ __ ] There's no girls who are into

243
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
me. I'm kind of ugly. I don't like the

244
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,640
way that I look. I've got no confidence.

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,120
I've got no good friends. Of course, you

246
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
feel like [ __ ] because every day for the

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
past years and years and years, you've

248
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
been doing these activities that makes

249
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
tomorrow worse. When you eat junk food,

250
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
it feels good right now, but then

251
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
tomorrow is worse. When you watch porn,

252
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
it feels good right now, but then

253
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,720
tomorrow is worse. When you take drugs,

254
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
when you play video games, it all feels

255
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,519
good right now, but then tomorrow is

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
worse. When you overdose on instant

257
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,080
gratification activities for long

258
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,920
enough, then you feel depressed. So then

259
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,640
what's the big strategy to cure

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,279
depression in just 2 weeks? We need to

261
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,399
do the opposite of instant gratification

262
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
activities. Remember, instant

263
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
gratification is the bad habits that we

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,600
do that feel good right now, like porn,

265
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
video games, junk food, but then they

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,240
make us worse tomorrow. The opposite of

267
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,680
that is the delayed gratification

268
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,920
activities. They feel hard right now,

269
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
but then they make us better tomorrow.

270
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
Can you think of a few of those right

271
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,800
now? What feels hard right now, but then

272
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,760
makes you better tomorrow? Exercise,

273
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,399
meditation, reading books, learning,

274
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,640
walking in nature, socializing with good

275
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,800
people, learning skills, spending

276
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,880
quality time with people that you love,

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
with your family. These things can feel

278
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
kind of uncomfortable right now. Like

279
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
imagine if I told you go spend some

280
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
quality time with your mother or your

281
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
father. If you're really visualizing it,

282
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
a lot of the guys watching this might

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
feel a bit cringe thinking like, "Oh,

284
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
like how do you do that? Oh, I don't

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,800
know. Like we're not really the type of

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
family who does that." Or if I tell you,

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
"Go and exercise right now." Some guys

288
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
will be like, "Okay, exercise is fun for

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,959
me." But for a lot of people, they'd be

290
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,240
like, "Oh, I don't know. Last time I

291
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
exercised, it just kind of hurt and you

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
don't even see any progress, whatever.

293
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,200
It doesn't feel good." Delayed

294
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,760
gratification activities feel hard right

295
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,519
now, but then tomorrow your life is

296
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
better. Now, straight away, if we just

297
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,440
go and do a few sit-ups right now or a

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,800
few push-ups, tomorrow technically we're

299
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
better because, you know, we worked out

300
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,839
today, but you don't really notice

301
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
anything. But then, if you stick to it

302
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,800
for 3 months, there's a big difference.

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,040
If you stick to it for 3 years, you look

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,880
completely different. That's the way to

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,399
stop being depressed. We get depressed

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,839
because we've done so many of the

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,120
instant gratification, the bad habits

308
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
like porn and video games and junk food

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
and going to sleep late and waking up

310
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
and scrolling on our phones to the point

311
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
that we just stolen happiness from

312
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,480
tomorrow. And then we look around and

313
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
we're just miserable and we have no good

314
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
friends. We have no women in our lives.

315
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,959
We don't like the way that we look.

316
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,959
We're not confident. We're not healthy.

317
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,800
We've got physical pain, emotional pain.

318
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,279
We just live a [ __ ] life. Of course, you

319
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,040
feel depressed when your life is [ __ ]

320
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
But delayed gratification is the way out

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
of depression where we do the hard thing

322
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,519
today. Like we eat clean. When we eat

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
clean, it doesn't really feel so nice

324
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,480
right now. Especially if you're new to

325
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
eating clean. If you've been eating

326
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
clean for a while, then it starts to

327
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
feel good. But let's say you're like

328
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,160
you're used to eating like a normal

329
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,920
person, junk food, whatever. And then we

330
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
give you like a healthy meal. It's got

331
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
single ingredients. It's not processed.

332
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
You eat it. You're like, "Ah, it doesn't

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
feel stimulating. Doesn't feel good."

334
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
Whatever. Doesn't feel good. It feels

335
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
hard. But then tomorrow you're a little

336
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,480
bit healthier and a little bit fitter.

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,839
Now, if you do that again and again and

338
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,560
again, your baseline goes up. That is

339
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,000
the way out of being depressed. That's

340
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
the big strategy you need to think into

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,720
your own mind. I got depressed because I

342
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,480
did those bad habits that feel good in

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
the moment, but then they make you feel

344
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,880
worse long term. The way that I stop

345
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
being depressed is I do the good habits

346
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,279
that feel hard right now, but then in

347
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,320
the long term they make you feel better.

348
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,480
So now let's go over the four major

349
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,480
causes of depression. Each one of these

350
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
is like a form of like instant

351
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,120
gratification. It happened because we

352
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,120
are basically just like living the fun,

353
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,360
enjoyable, stimulating life right now

354
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,279
which is stealing from tomorrow. The

355
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,600
first major cause of depression in young

356
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:42,720
men is bad physical habits. Poor sleep,

357
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639
lack of exercise, bad diets. These

358
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
things that just make you physically

359
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,920
feel like [ __ ] Like maybe you wake up

360
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,240
and you don't even have morning wood

361
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
anymore. Maybe you eat a diet that makes

362
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
your stomach rumble. Maybe you're not

363
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,959
even like drinking water or something so

364
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,560
you've got like a headache. Maybe you're

365
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,920
just scrolling for so long that your

366
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
head hurts and you just feel kind of

367
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
numb and your attention span's all

368
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
[ __ ] up. This is one of the major

369
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,320
causes of depression in young people.

370
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
They just spend hours scrolling on their

371
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,839
phone destroying their attention span.

372
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
Like their brains are literally

373
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,440
shrinking. They've got all these bad

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
basic level habits. Like they're not

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
going to sleep on time. They're going to

376
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,040
sleep at really inconsistent times. One

377
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,079
day it's 9:00 p.m. The other day it's

378
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
11:00. Right? You're probably thinking,

379
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,320
"Oh, that's not so bad. 9 9:00 p.m. then

380
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
11:00 p.m. the next day." that's really

381
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,440
terrible for your health. Or you're

382
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
eating different foods. You're eating

383
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
foods that like randomly you'll get the

384
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
[ __ ] afterwards or your stomach hurts.

385
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
You've got a headache. You're just doing

386
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,839
all these poor physical habits. This is

387
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,000
like the foundation of a good life that

388
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
you actually feel good in your body.

389
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,399
Now, the second major cause of

390
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,320
depression in young men is social

391
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,600
isolation. You've lived the kind of life

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,200
because of instant gratification

393
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
activities like video games where you

394
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,519
don't even have good people around you

395
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,079
because the craving of your social life

396
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,639
has been fulfilled with fake

397
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,720
brotherhood. We as young men desire

398
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,760
brotherhood status and recognition.

399
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,800
We're supposed to mix with other men, be

400
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,639
competitive, and grow. The problem is

401
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,440
these days it's just easier to do that

402
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,760
on video games. Imagine if technology

403
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
didn't exist. You would have such a pull

404
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
to hang out with the boys and then to do

405
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
competitive [ __ ] like martial arts or

406
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,880
lifting heavy weights to develop

407
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
yourself as a man because you wanted to

408
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
be respected by the other men around

409
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,440
you. Now that video games exist, instead

410
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,160
of craving that brotherhood in real

411
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,639
life, you crave it in Call of Duty.

412
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,040
Instead of getting your purple belt in

413
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,360
jiu-jitsu, you want to get the sixth

414
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
prestige in Call of Duty. Instead of

415
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
making money in real life so that you

416
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,399
have like this status and this feeling

417
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,399
of importance, you want to make money in

418
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,480
GTA or these MMO RPGs. We need to have

419
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
brotherhood in our lives in our physical

420
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,760
world, not just online, so that we have

421
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,199
this huge pull to succeed. Because look,

422
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,959
a lot of people online will tell you

423
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,959
that you don't need to like, you know,

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
like you shouldn't care what anyone

425
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,959
thinks about you. And I swear to God,

426
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,959
everyone who says that is a [ __ ]

427
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
Jeffrey little [ __ ] If you don't care

428
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,279
what anyone thinks about you, you're

429
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,240
probably a [ __ ] freak. Every guy that

430
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,079
I know that I respect very much cares

431
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,519
what his tribe thinks about him. He

432
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
cares what his family thinks about him.

433
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
He cares what the other strong men

434
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,320
thinks about him. You shouldn't care

435
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
about what like the peasants think about

436
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
you, the Jeffre, right? Let's say if you

437
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,199
start going to the gym, some of your

438
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,399
Jeffrey friends will look at you and be

439
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,519
like, "Ah, he's gay. He's going to the

440
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,959
gym." You don't want to care about what

441
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,800
they think, but you should think of some

442
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
like highlevel guys you know. Maybe you

443
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
think of like your big brother or this

444
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
one guy that you know who's successful.

445
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
Or maybe you just think about role

446
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,560
models in your life and you think,

447
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,800
"Okay, I know this sounds a bit cringe,

448
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
but I'd like to impress them. If I ever

449
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,079
meet Hamza, I want him to look at me and

450
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,639
be like, "Damn, bro." Like, you're in

451
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,440
good shape. It's that desire of the

452
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,839
feeling of importance and acceptance in

453
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,160
a male in like a masculine brotherhood

454
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,680
that causes you to really want to grow.

455
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
And there's nothing wrong with that.

456
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
That is a completely natural desire for

457
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,000
men. We want other men to see us as high

458
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,279
status, important, and competitive. In

459
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,519
the modern day, we're told that that's

460
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,120
like an insecure thing. It's not at all.

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
The guys who say like, "Oh, I've got no

462
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,480
ego. I don't care what anyone thinks of

463
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
me." They're the biggest [ __ ] [ __ ]

464
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
of all. They try and act like all

465
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
confident when they say this, but

466
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
they're like [ __ ] little skinny neck

467
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
little dweebs, out of shape, weird

468
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
people. You don't want to be like one of

469
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
those people, even though it sounds like

470
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,480
a flex. Like, I don't care what anyone

471
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
thinks of me. I'm telling you, no

472
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,040
[ __ ] masculine guy actually believes

473
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
that. Every masculine guy cares what

474
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,079
other people in his tribe think. Yeah,

475
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,680
you don't want the peasants to judge

476
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,440
you. Who cares about their perspective?

477
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
But I care what people think about me. I

478
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
care what my my followers think about

479
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
me. I care what my family think about

480
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
me. I care what my male friends think

481
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
about me. Because if they think badly

482
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,199
about me, that's a reflection of me

483
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,040
messing up. When I do good in life, when

484
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,040
I've been hardworking, I get more

485
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
respect from my friends. So therefore, I

486
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,000
can use the respect that I get from my

487
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,519
friends as a judgment of whether or not

488
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,600
I've been actually living to my

489
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,519
potential. other men in your life should

490
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
be able to pick out your weaknesses and

491
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,160
tell you that you're [ __ ] up, tell

492
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,920
you that you've been complacent. When

493
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,480
you don't have brotherhood in your life,

494
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,480
it's so easy to just get into these bad

495
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
habits and to just go sink away on the

496
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,240
internet and just go play video games

497
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
and just go sit at home. If you lived

498
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,439
with like masculine guys, imagine that

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,959
scenario. Imagine you lived with

500
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,880
masculine guys. Like imagine me, you,

501
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
and 10 other guys like us lived in the

502
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
same massive villa together. You would

503
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
not be jacking off in your bedroom. You

504
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
would not be in there playing video

505
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
games. There's a 0% chance. You know

506
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,720
why? Because I wouldn't let that happen.

507
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,720
The other guys in the house wouldn't let

508
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
that happen. If anyone was like in their

509
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
room all day would knock on, be like,

510
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
"What the [ __ ] are you doing, bro?

511
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
You're not jacking off, are you? You're

512
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
not playing video games. Okay, you're

513
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,320
just doing work. Okay, sweet." It'd be

514
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,919
so easy to get to competitive. One guy

515
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
drops down and starts doing push-ups.

516
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,640
The other guys would just [ __ ] start

517
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
as well. One guy says, "Our boys, let's

518
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,320
go spar today. Let's go box each other.

519
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,080
Everyone's down." You're just like 10

520
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,559
times more productive. When you don't

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,240
have brotherhood, it's so easy to get

522
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,160
into those bad habits, the porn, video

523
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
games, junk food, and then you feel

524
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
depressed. Now, the third cause of

525
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,240
depression in young men is having

526
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,480
nothing to look forward to. Having no

527
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,000
hope for the future. What does that

528
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,200
sound like? Think about it. Having

529
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,039
nothing to look forward to.

530
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
Delayed gratification. Remember what I

531
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,480
told you before? Instant and delayed

532
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,160
gratification. Delayed gratification is

533
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,679
when we do the good habits that feel

534
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,880
hard right now, but they make our life

535
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,640
better and better and better. Like

536
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
exercise. When you do the delayed

537
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
gratification activities, the good

538
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
habits like meditation, exercise,

539
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,559
journaling, reading, all those things

540
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,240
that develop you, right? They do feel

541
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,840
hard right now. I won't lie to you. They

542
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,360
feel hard and uncomfortable, but you

543
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,679
just know they make your life better

544
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,200
tomorrow and more and more and more. So,

545
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,200
when you do loads of delayed

546
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
gratification, good habits, you have

547
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,320
something to look forward to. When

548
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,400
you're consistently going to the gym,

549
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
you start feeling happy for the future

550
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
because you know you're going to get a

551
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,840
six-pack soon. That's what makes you

552
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,160
feel so hopeful and pleasant and it

553
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,440
gives you a positive outlook on life

554
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
when you don't have something to look

555
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
forward to which is basically instant

556
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,799
gratification. You almost don't want

557
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
time to pass, right? Imagine you're only

558
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,760
doing the bad habits. You know tomorrow

559
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,960
you're going to wake up with a worse

560
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
brain. You know that tomorrow you're

561
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
going to wake up with more fat on your

562
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
body. You don't have anything to look

563
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
forward to. You're literally the future

564
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,520
seems bleak. This is how guys get so

565
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,600
depressed and they even start getting

566
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,039
the desire to delete themselves because

567
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,799
they look to the future and they don't

568
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,000
see anything positive happening because

569
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,679
they keep doing the bad habits that

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,679
makes tomorrow worse and worse and

571
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
worse. Can you imagine just how bad of

572
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
an existence that is? And you probably

573
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,880
live this way where you're mostly just

574
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,880
doing the bad habits that makes tomorrow

575
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,919
worse. When you do so much of them, you

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
get to this point where you start

577
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
getting so depressed and you're so

578
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,799
nihilistic for the future because you

579
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
think when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be a

580
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,160
little bit fatter and more of a loser.

581
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
when I wake up the next day, I'll be a

582
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,960
little bit fatter and more of a loser

583
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,559
and over and over and over again. So,

584
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,240
you don't want it to be the future. You

585
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
don't see anything positive happening in

586
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,600
the future. So, of course, you get

587
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
depressed. You get this like nihilistic

588
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,280
sad kind of energy. And now linked with

589
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,840
this, the fourth cause of depression

590
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,360
that I see in young men is no purpose,

591
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,320
no mission, no contribution to others.

592
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,679
As a young man, the single most

593
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,760
important thing in your life, do you

594
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,720
know what it is? It's not girls. It's

595
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,760
not even your family. The single most

596
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,559
important thing in your life is your

597
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,400
goals, your mission, the purpose of your

598
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,240
existence. Basically, your mission is

599
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
like the big work that you're going to

600
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,559
spend the next 5, 10, 20 years of your

601
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,120
life on. And it's always best if you

602
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,280
feel like it contributes to others. What

603
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
is the mission of your existence? Who

604
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
are you contributing to? Most young men,

605
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
if you ask them, "What's your purpose?

606
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,120
What's your mission?" They'll be like,

607
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,559
"Oh, what? Unk so corny, bro? Dead rose

608
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
emoji." Like they're just kids who like,

609
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,000
"Oh, you're so corny, bro." They're

610
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,200
depressed, getting ready to [ __ ]

611
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,440
delete themselves, but they'll think

612
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,120
you're [ __ ] cringe. Corny because

613
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
you're talking about purpose or mission.

614
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,240
No, being [ __ ] suicidal is the corny

615
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
thing. Being suicidal is [ __ ] cringe.

616
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
Not the guy who's like got a purpose for

617
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,039
his [ __ ] existence, right? Most young

618
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
men, if you ever ask them like, "What's

619
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
the mission of your life?" They'll be

620
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,840
like, "What?" They'll have no idea what

621
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
the [ __ ] you mean. They'll try and clown

622
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,039
you and say that it's cringe or

623
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,480
whatever. And that's why they're all

624
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,960
depressed and their screen time's

625
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,039
[ __ ] obn like like crazy like [ __ ]

626
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
6 hours a day. And there'll be some guys

627
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
watching this thinking, "Oh [ __ ] like 6

628
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
hours is crazy. Mine's like 12." What is

629
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,520
the mission for your existence? What is

630
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
the big thing you're working on that's

631
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
going to help humanity? This isn't just

632
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
your work or your career. This is like

633
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,440
the thing that you wake up for and you

634
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
think, "Holy [ __ ] I am needed in the

635
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
world." Can you imagine how I feel?

636
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,120
Think about the kind of videos and the

637
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,840
work that I do. I wake up and I feel

638
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,679
like I'm needed in the world. There's

639
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
guys who come up to me with tears in

640
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,039
their eyes and they say they would have

641
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,799
deleted themselves if it wasn't for my

642
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400
work. My mission is to help the young

643
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,880
men of the world. Can you imagine how

644
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,559
much like energy vitality that gives me?

645
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,120
I could never even be close to deleting

646
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,640
myself because I'm needed on this world.

647
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,080
When you feel like you're not needed,

648
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,039
then honestly, that's where those

649
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,039
thoughts come in where you're like,

650
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,880
well, look, I'm not needed. I'm just a

651
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,320
drain. My family would be better off

652
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,559
without me. That's how you get so

653
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,000
depressed and nihilistic and suicidal.

654
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,360
That's where you start to rationally,

655
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,799
not even with emotion, you start to

656
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,760
rationally just think like my family

657
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,159
would be better off if I died. Right?

658
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,320
This is because you are not contributing

659
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,480
to others. When you don't have a

660
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,400
mission, like this kind of work that you

661
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
feel like is helping others, then you

662
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
start to just get so depressed. You need

663
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
to have some kind of mission. You need

664
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,760
to have some kind of work that you feel

665
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,919
contributes to others. Whether it's like

666
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm doing like on this global scale or

667
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,360
if it's just you with just one person

668
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
you're trying to help or maybe you're

669
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
just trying to help your family and

670
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,360
you're focused on them because you want

671
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
to make money so that you can retire

672
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,960
them. Maybe you're trying to help the

673
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,559
stray dogs in your country and you feel

674
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,919
like a man like these animals, they need

675
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,320
me. Maybe you're trying to fix the

676
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,720
climate. Maybe you're trying to help the

677
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,320
world stop using plastics because that's

678
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,000
causing infertility. Whatever the

679
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,760
mission is, you need to have some kind

680
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,120
of mission. Cuz if you don't, your

681
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
rational brain will just tell you,

682
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,840
"Yeah, there's literally no one will

683
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
miss you. There's no reason for your

684
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,360
existence. You're just a consumer." And

685
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,799
and when you're done feeling good about

686
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,480
consuming and you just feel bad, and

687
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,480
there's also nothing hopeful for the

688
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
future. Well, then what's the point on

689
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,240
existing? As men, please remember what

690
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm about to say here. I promise this is

691
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,200
one of the most important sentences I'm

692
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,960
going to say in this video. As men, we

693
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,600
need to feel helpful. We need to feel

694
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,520
helpful to either our family or to a

695
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
certain demographic of people like I do

696
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,799
with young men. I feel helpful towards

697
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,799
young men. We need to feel like we're

698
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,159
contributing in some ways. For women,

699
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,000
you know what's interesting? Not so

700
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,159
much. For women, they don't have as much

701
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
of this desire. A woman, no offense, but

702
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
like especially for feminine women, a

703
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
lot of their focus is just on

704
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,280
themselves. For a masculine guy like us,

705
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,280
a lot of our focus is outward on other

706
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,960
people. We have like the hero complex.

707
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,799
Like we want to be a hero. We want to

708
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
save people. If you don't have that,

709
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,919
your brain will just tell you, "Yeah,

710
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,520
there's no point in you even being alive

711
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,440
right now." So, think right now, one of

712
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
the reasons why I'm depressed is because

713
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,280
I just don't have a mission that feels

714
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,360
like I'm actually contributing to other

715
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,919
people. So, I've just went over the four

716
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,840
causes of depression in young men. I've

717
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
gave you a bunch of highlevel ideas to

718
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
think about, but now, let's make them

719
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,919
super tactical. Let's make them so

720
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,760
tactical that if you follow the next

721
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,840
section, I give you my word, within two

722
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,919
weeks, you would have cured the

723
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,120
depression feeling that you have. And I

724
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,799
know what you're thinking. Wait, what?

725
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,760
Shut up. Two weeks, you're going to cure

726
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,360
my depression that I've had for years.

727
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,559
Yes. Two weeks of you following my

728
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,960
advice is more effective than all of the

729
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,600
therapists in the world put together. My

730
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,440
advice is better than therapy. I give

731
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,120
you my [ __ ] word. I know there will

732
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,559
be some dorks watching this who are

733
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,080
[ __ ] taking anti-depressants every

734
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
day saying, "Oh, that Hamza, that can't

735
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,200
be true." Look at their results. For

736
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,960
anyone who doubts me, look at their

737
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
results. They stay depressed forever.

738
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,679
For every guy who watches me and

739
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,039
actually just tries what I say, they'll

740
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,240
come back within two weeks. You'll see

741
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
some of them in the comments after this

742
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,400
video has been posted for two weeks

743
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,320
saying, "Holy [ __ ] it worked." I am

744
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,120
telling you, this has helped literally

745
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
millions of guys. Two weeks of my

746
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,919
advice, which I'm about to give you

747
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,559
right now, I promise will be better for

748
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,400
you than 2 years of therapy or

749
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,559
anti-depressants. You know why? Because

750
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm about to get rid of the reason why

751
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,039
you have depression in the first place.

752
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,279
When you take these stupid [ __ ]

753
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,279
medication like anti-depressants, it

754
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,120
only gets rid of the symptom, but your

755
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,880
life is still shitty. So, the cause of

756
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
depression is still there. So, now you

757
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,279
take this anti-depressant and now your

758
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
dick doesn't work and now you're more

759
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,720
depressed, but you don't really feel the

760
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,240
depression. you just kind of feel

761
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
nothing, which kind of makes you more

762
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,919
depressed anyway. So, you stop all that

763
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,400
[ __ ] and you put your trust into the

764
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,080
next section of this video. For just two

765
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
weeks, you just try the things that I'm

766
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,279
about to say, and you'll be one of the

767
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,640
guys in the comments saying, "I watched

768
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
this video 2 weeks ago. I've been doing

769
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
what Hamza said. I messed up a little

770
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
bit, but I've been trying it as best as

771
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
I can, and this is the happiest I've

772
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,520
felt for as long as I can remember."

773
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,799
Because this has literally worked, I'm

774
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,440
not exaggerating, this has worked for

775
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,200
over a million guys so far. Two weeks is

776
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
better than years of anti-depressants or

777
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,720
therapy or anything else you can

778
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,279
possibly find. This is exactly what to

779
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,640
do. Here are the seven steps to cure

780
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,360
depression. Step number one, set goals.

781
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
I want you to set some goals for the

782
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,159
future that you can achieve. The reason

783
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,440
why this is important, you're probably

784
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
thinking, setting goals, okay, I've

785
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,799
heard this before, but look, the reason

786
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,200
why setting goals is so important is

787
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,679
that it gives you something to hope for

788
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,000
in the future. And I'm going to tell you

789
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,080
right now, one of the best goals you can

790
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
set is just like what happened to

791
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,919
Jeffrey at the start of this video.

792
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,840
Adonis pops into his life and he shows

793
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,159
him the ultimate life for young men. And

794
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,120
that's where you're traveling the world

795
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,799
with other guys just like you. You make

796
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,880
money online so you can become kind of

797
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,720
like a digital nomad. You can move to

798
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
the hot spots of the world where you're

799
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,400
away from family, away from everyone in

800
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
your hometown who used to know you as

801
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
the nerdy little guy. And now you can be

802
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
anyone you want to be. You travel to

803
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,080
places like I live in Bali. You travel

804
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
to here with other guys who are just

805
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
like you. Everyone here is on like

806
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,720
self-improvement, reading books,

807
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
meditating, eating clean. You hit the

808
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
gym and lift weights with other guys

809
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,120
that you meet here. And it's hype

810
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
between sessions. Between sets, you're

811
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
making each other laugh. And you go do

812
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
some martial arts with them, some

813
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,720
boxing, some jiu-jitsu. Whilst you're

814
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
doing these sessions, you notice that

815
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
there's so many pretty girls around. And

816
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,760
all these girls read books. They watch

817
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,039
like self-improvement content just like

818
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,720
you. They've wanted to improve their

819
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,919
lives as well. You learn how to flirt.

820
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,679
You start feeling like this, you know,

821
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
like this [ __ ] young man full of

822
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,559
vitality. You're traveling the world

823
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,159
with your boys. You're flirting with

824
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,679
girls. You're eating good meals. You're

825
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,039
exercising. You've got a great physique.

826
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,600
You're confident. You're driving around

827
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,279
on a [ __ ] bike shirtless thinking

828
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,880
this is the [ __ ] life. That's the

829
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,559
goal that I would set for most of the

830
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,039
guys who are watching this. The goal of

831
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,039
being like a digital nomad in a place

832
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,360
like Barley. Make that your goal. And

833
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,200
it's something that realistically anyone

834
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,559
watching this can achieve within the

835
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
next few years. You just need to make

836
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,880
like a few thousand a month online,

837
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,320
which is definitely tricky of course,

838
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
but if you put your mind to it for the

839
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
next 1 to two years, you can achieve it

840
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,919
just like many people have. By the way,

841
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,760
bro, there's tons of retards who have

842
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
achieved this every day. I'll speak to

843
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
people who are like not intelligent at

844
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
all, and they all make like 5 to 10k a

845
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
month online. It's not like terribly

846
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
difficult. You're probably more

847
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,640
intelligent than most of these people.

848
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,320
It's just that these people have just

849
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,760
kind of like tried. That's it. So, you

850
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
set that as one of your goals. Along

851
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,360
with that, maybe you set building like a

852
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,559
really nice physique one of your goals

853
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,960
because going to the gym and lifting

854
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,960
weights is so fun. Such like a masculine

855
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,240
sport. It's so stimulating. You lift

856
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
weights for the like the rest of your

857
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,440
life. You get strong. You look jacked.

858
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,480
Every time you're shirtless or even when

859
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,600
you're wearing clothes, you look at

860
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,039
yourself, you're like, "Man, that feels

861
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,559
[ __ ] good." Boom. That's like your

862
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
second goal. Maybe the third goal is

863
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
that you want to have like an awesome

864
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
girlfriend. Maybe you even want two

865
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,159
girlfriends. You write that down. You

866
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,080
write a couple of goals for you to

867
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,240
achieve over the next few years. You

868
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,080
visualize these goals in your mind and

869
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,840
whatever one gets you hype and you're

870
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
like, "Man, that'd be [ __ ] cool."

871
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,120
Like, I that's actually possible. Like,

872
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,360
I could I could actually have that. Holy

873
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,799
[ __ ] That's the right goal for you. The

874
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,480
first step to curing depression is

875
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,240
setting those goals because now we have

876
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
something to work towards. And

877
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,200
instantly, this makes you feel better

878
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,799
right away cuz you're thinking, "Oh

879
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
[ __ ] like I've got a mission. I've got

880
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,039
something to march towards. There's this

881
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,640
lifestyle that I can enjoy, which is

882
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,240
completely different from the way that

883
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
I'm living right now." The second step

884
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,320
to curing depression once we have the

885
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
goals written down is to do the positive

886
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,640
mental health habits that will make us

887
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,880
feel mentally better. Meditation,

888
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,880
gratitude journaling, exercise, and also

889
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,039
mindset training. I'll go over each of

890
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,120
these briefly. Meditation. The reason

891
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,120
why we meditate is so that we can become

892
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,679
more present. Basically, when you're

893
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,360
present, that refers to a time where

894
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,520
you're not like deep in thought about

895
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,880
the past or the future. When we think

896
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,640
about the past or the future, that's

897
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
when we get like depressed or anxious.

898
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,799
The best moment in life is when you're

899
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,080
here right now, actually there. Let's

900
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,919
say we're having a conversation with

901
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,760
someone. We want to be present with

902
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
them, actually here with them. We don't

903
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,760
want our mind to be randomly kind of

904
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,120
thinking other memories whilst we're

905
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,480
speaking to this person. There was a

906
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,080
study that found that no matter what

907
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,440
you're thinking about, whatever memory

908
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,520
you have in your mind, even if it's a

909
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,360
bit of a pleasant memory, it's actually

910
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,360
worse for your happiness than if you're

911
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,960
just present here right now. Most people

912
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,159
are not very present people because a

913
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,240
lot of the [ __ ] that we do like you know

914
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
the phone stimulation it kind of

915
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,919
destroys a bit of your presence and you

916
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,760
start having all this mind wandering you

917
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,600
get random memories random insights

918
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,840
whatever you just want to be here where

919
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,760
you are right now so the way to get more

920
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
present is to meditate and you and every

921
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,240
time I tell someone to meditate by the

922
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
way they always tell me the same thing

923
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,279
they're like oh no well I tried it but

924
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,360
it doesn't work and I totally get that

925
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,200
but it's [ __ ] that's like saying oh

926
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,880
well I tried lifting weights but it it

927
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,880
didn't work you know I did like 10 reps

928
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,440
and then I couldn't do anymore. more.

929
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,600
So, you hit failure.

930
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,840
Yes,

931
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,279
that was the point. Like that was

932
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,399
literally the point. Like like if you're

933
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
not going to the gym, you might not

934
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,720
understand this, but people will say

935
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,159
like, "Oh, well, I tried to meditate,

936
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
but then I got a thought." You do

937
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,880
realize that was the point. Like that

938
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
you literally were meditating. If you

939
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,440
just kept on doing that, you would have

940
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,559
gotten the result. When you meditate,

941
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
look, this is how you meditate, right?

942
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,320
So, you just focus on your breath. Just

943
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,760
feel the sensation wherever. Just keep

944
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,279
it in one point. So, for example, I

945
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,360
always just choose this bit here. Right

946
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,520
there. I just feel whatever sensation I

947
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,520
can there.

948
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,880
Within a few seconds, your brain starts

949
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,480
to think about other stuff cuz it's

950
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,320
boring, right? Your brain starts to

951
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,919
think about this thing or this memory or

952
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,600
this to-do list, whatever. The moment

953
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,000
you catch your brain thinking about

954
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,200
anything else, all you have to do is

955
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,440
just focus back there again. It's like

956
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,679
your brain focuses here, then your brain

957
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,360
starts wandering away. You realize it's

958
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
wandering away and you just bring it

959
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,720
back here. Within a few seconds, your

960
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
brain starts wandering away again, and

961
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,279
you bring it back here over and over and

962
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,360
over again. Every time you bring it back

963
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,039
to this spot, you've leveled up the

964
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,440
skill of meditation. You'll get so good

965
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,760
at this that your speed of bringing it

966
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,440
back will be so quick that it'll feel as

967
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,679
if it never really left in the first

968
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
place and you're just there all the

969
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,480
time. That's how you train. So, if you

970
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,760
ever tried to meditate and you're like,

971
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
"Oh, you know, I started getting

972
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
thoughts. I couldn't stop thinking."

973
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
That's actually okay. That's actually

974
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,799
kind of even better because you noticed

975
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
you were thinking. So the next time you

976
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
try like and I would suggest you

977
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,360
meditate every morning by the way. As

978
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
soon as you wake up, set your pillows

979
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
upright so you can sit on the edge of

980
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,840
your bed. Set a timer on your phone. You

981
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,200
don't even have to download any app if

982
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
you don't want to. But I just set a

983
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,799
timer on your phone. 1 minute, 3

984
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,559
minutes. Just focus on your breath here.

985
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,159
The moment you notice, oh, I've been

986
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,159
thinking about high school or I've been

987
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,320
thinking about this guy or whatever,

988
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,919
just focus back there again. Every

989
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,600
single time you bring it back there,

990
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,600
it's like you've just done one bicep

991
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,039
curl for the brain. Every single time

992
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
you bring it back. So, it's a good thing

993
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,720
when you notice that your mind has

994
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,480
wandered. It's a good thing. That's part

995
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,399
of it. You just bring it back. When you

996
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,840
bring it back over and over again every

997
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,440
single day for a few minutes and, you

998
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,799
know, up to even 10 minutes, 20 minutes

999
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,559
eventually, but just start with 1

1000
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,840
minute. When you keep doing that, you'll

1001
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,279
notice that your brain will just

1002
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,960
naturally do that when you're in

1003
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,399
conversations. You'll notice sometimes

1004
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
you'll be in the gym, you maybe you'll

1005
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,440
be doing some push-ups and your brain

1006
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,440
will start to think about some other

1007
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,960
thing which is irrelevant like you know

1008
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,720
what you're going to eat later and your

1009
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,799
brain will just come back to the present

1010
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
moment and feel the push-up, feel your

1011
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,240
chest and you'll get like a way better

1012
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
pump. What you want throughout your

1013
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,000
entire life is you want to just be

1014
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
focused on what you're doing right now.

1015
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,760
Kind of like a pro alete would a pro

1016
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,760
athlete is about to perform. Imagine

1017
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,360
they're doing like a deadlift or they're

1018
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,559
about to box or something. They're not

1019
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,600
thinking about what to eat later.

1020
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,559
they're thinking about, okay, make sure

1021
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,559
you step like this. You know, they're

1022
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,679
just in a flow state, right? That's what

1023
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,960
you want to be in when you're speaking

1024
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,320
to a girl. You don't want to be thinking

1025
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,919
about what to do with my hands or

1026
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,120
whatever. You just want to be here in

1027
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,640
this moment. You don't basically, you

1028
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,159
don't want any thoughts in your mind.

1029
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,519
And the more you meditate, the less

1030
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,960
thoughts in your mind you'll have, which

1031
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,799
I know sounds a bit weird, but I promise

1032
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,080
you, it's actually so much better for

1033
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,159
your performance. Like, you'll perform

1034
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,320
so much better in everything. The more

1035
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,480
you meditate, the more present you are.

1036
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,399
So, make that one of your daily habits.

1037
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,919
Start meditating every morning. moment

1038
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,760
your eyes open, you know, you turn your

1039
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
alarm off, set your pillows upright, sit

1040
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,880
up straight, and just set an alarm for

1041
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,320
like 1 minute or something and just do

1042
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
it as best as you can. It's literally

1043
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,159
just one minute. It's so short that you

1044
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
could do this every single day for the

1045
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,399
rest of your life, right? Think about

1046
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
it. Every single day for the rest of

1047
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,039
your life, you could do one minute in

1048
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
the morning. I would recommend doing it

1049
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,679
first thing in the morning. I'm talking

1050
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
your eyes open. You've not even brushed

1051
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,080
your teeth. You've not checked your

1052
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,279
phone or anything. Grab your phone,

1053
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,640
maybe even use your watch or something

1054
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,919
if you can't resist like scrolling on

1055
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,760
your phone, checking your notifications,

1056
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,520
whatever. And just for one minute, just

1057
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,119
focus on your breath. Boom. After a

1058
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
week, maybe increase it to two minutes.

1059
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,720
Get up to like 20 minutes and that's

1060
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,399
[ __ ] awesome. Do that, you'll be more

1061
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,919
present, and that will stop you from

1062
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,639
getting all these random thoughts that

1063
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,240
just make the day-to-day life less fun.

1064
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,399
Then the other mental health habit you

1065
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,320
can do is gratitude journaling. So

1066
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,839
that's where you'll take some time right

1067
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,200
after you meditate, you know, you wake

1068
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,040
up, do the one minute of meditation,

1069
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,720
right after you've done that, grab a pen

1070
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,079
and a piece of paper or the notes app on

1071
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,919
your phone, but I really think writing

1072
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,159
it seems to work better. And just write,

1073
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,839
"Today I'm grateful for." and just sit

1074
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
for a second and think, okay, what can I

1075
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,960
be grateful for? What's something that

1076
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,280
if it was removed from my life, would I

1077
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,560
really miss?

1078
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,720
And the first thing that comes to your

1079
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,079
mind is your mother.

1080
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,280
You think about one of your friends

1081
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,560
who's lost their mothers recently, and

1082
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
you think to yourself, what would you do

1083
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,520
if one day you woke up and she was just

1084
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,040
dead?

1085
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,920
How would that feel? Imagine the the

1086
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,920
gut-wrenching pain.

1087
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,720
And now smile because she's still here

1088
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,920
and realize the last few weeks you've

1089
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,440
completely taken her for granted.

1090
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,280
Suddenly you just appreciate her more.

1091
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,440
How about like visualizing like just

1092
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,520
pretend for a second

1093
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,400
it's 60 years from now. Pretend we're

1094
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,760
all like 70, 80, 90 years old. We're

1095
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,720
getting close to dying. You know, we're

1096
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
like in a hospital. We can't even stand.

1097
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,520
We're getting dripfed [ __ ] nutrients.

1098
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,240
We're about to die. Just visualize that

1099
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,119
for a second and imagine somehow it's

1100
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,400
like a miracle. You're like 90 years old

1101
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
and you just press some magical button

1102
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
and you've been transported to where you

1103
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,920
are right now. Imagine we were just 90

1104
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,680
years old about to die. You look down,

1105
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,040
you're like, "Oh my god, holy [ __ ] I'm

1106
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,640
like I'm like 20 again." You know, it's

1107
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
like sometimes like there's like a movie

1108
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
plot that's like that, isn't there? like

1109
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,839
whether he's an old guy and then he

1110
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,040
comes back to his re like young life and

1111
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,800
he's about to change his life and

1112
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,079
everything. There's no reason why you

1113
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,000
can't behave like that right now and

1114
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,000
just be like, "Holy shit." Like I I'm

1115
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
young. I'm young. My legs [ __ ] work.

1116
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,680
I can jump. I can I can run. My My

1117
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
parents are still alive. Why don't you

1118
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,119
just act like that right now? Think

1119
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,000
about it. Like what's stopping you from

1120
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,760
acting like you were just 90 years old

1121
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,440
and you've just been transported back to

1122
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
like your 20-year-old version? What's

1123
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
stopping you from just pretending like

1124
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,119
your mother died and then snapping back

1125
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,040
and thinking, "Oh my god, she's still

1126
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,400
here." What's stopping you really from

1127
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240
going into your mom's room right now,

1128
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,800
going into the kitchen, wherever she is,

1129
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,640
and just giving her a hug as if you had

1130
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,079
lived a reality in which she had died

1131
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,440
and now she's here again. What's

1132
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,880
stopping you from doing that? And I know

1133
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,160
it feels a bit cringe, doesn't it? Let's

1134
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,839
be honest. It feels a bit cringe to like

1135
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,520
go and give your mom like an extra hug

1136
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,440
today or, you know, to do this. But I

1137
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,119
promise you, you will feel happier.

1138
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
Gratitude journaling. It's the act of

1139
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
you just sitting there and thinking,

1140
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,480
"Okay, if I lost something in my life

1141
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,560
and I just got it back, I would

1142
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,400
appreciate it so much more." So, look

1143
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,480
around your room. Think about the people

1144
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,760
and the things in your life and just

1145
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,000
think to yourself, what can you be

1146
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,920
grateful for?

1147
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Imagine you were in a car accident and

1148
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,720
you lost like your arm. Imagine it got

1149
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,160
crushed and they had to like sever it

1150
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,640
and you had to get one of those weird

1151
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,000
[ __ ] metal hands or whatever. And

1152
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
yeah, the technology is pretty good

1153
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,640
these days, but it's still not your

1154
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,079
[ __ ] hand, right? And imagine how

1155
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,599
much more new things you'd have to

1156
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,440
learn. You'd have to learn to walk again

1157
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,560
or to grab things, whatever. And now

1158
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
look at your hand and just be like,

1159
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,880
"Man, I've got my [ __ ] hand." Do you

1160
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,440
know anyone who's ever like sat there

1161
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,359
been like, "I'm so grateful for my

1162
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,280
hands.

1163
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm so grateful for like this clothing

1164
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
that I wear. I'm so grateful for the

1165
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,280
house we live in." We could have lived

1166
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,520
in a way [ __ ] house. I'm so grateful

1167
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
that both my parents are alive. I'm so

1168
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,880
grateful for these devices that I have

1169
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,160
where I can connect to others. I'm so

1170
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,640
grateful for my joints, the fact that I

1171
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,400
don't have extreme pain. I'm so grateful

1172
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,320
for the pen that I write with. I'm so

1173
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
grateful for the school that I go to for

1174
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,640
my teachers. I'm so grateful for my

1175
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,480
friend. You visualize each of these

1176
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,079
things just suddenly disappearing from

1177
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,520
your life. How much pain you'd be in if

1178
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,079
you went to school and you heard that

1179
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,200
your best friend had passed away. And

1180
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,119
then it's almost like you click your

1181
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,400
fingers and realize they're still alive.

1182
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,920
and all the things that you would have

1183
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,839
said at their funeral, you can say to

1184
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,920
them now. Do you see how powerful this

1185
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,480
practice can be? Because it makes you

1186
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,720
appreciate the things in your life. For

1187
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
all of our day-to-day life, we think

1188
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,920
about the things we don't have, the girl

1189
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,079
that we want, the money that we want to

1190
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,440
build, the physique that we want, the

1191
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,560
few minutes that you spend in this

1192
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,000
practice of gratitude, journaling.

1193
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,920
It's finally some time where you're

1194
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,440
thinking about the things you do have

1195
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,200
and asking yourself, what would life be

1196
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,359
like if you suddenly lost that thing? So

1197
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,880
this is like your new daily routine. You

1198
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,560
wake up and the moment you wake up, you

1199
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
do the one minute of meditation. Just

1200
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,240
focus on that one spot. When you notice

1201
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,079
your your mind's wandered, you bring it

1202
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,440
back. Boom. Do the one minute of that, 2

1203
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,720
minutes, 3 minutes, whatever. Straight

1204
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,240
after that, do some gratitude

1205
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
journaling. Sit there for a minute.

1206
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,119
Think about something in your life.

1207
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,040
Think about someone in your life and

1208
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,800
just write down how it would feel if you

1209
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,960
lost them. And then write down how nice

1210
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,640
it is that you still have them in your

1211
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,079
life. And I know it will feel cringe,

1212
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,359
but what if you just go and tell them

1213
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,119
how much you appreciate them?

1214
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,680
What if things were worse?

1215
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,079
What if you were someone who has like

1216
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,200
this random disease or this physical

1217
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,079
ailment and you don't?

1218
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,680
There's someone your age right now who's

1219
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,400
disabled. There's someone your age right

1220
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,720
now who's 10 times more poor than you

1221
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,240
and your family.

1222
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,079
So, it makes you appreciate the things

1223
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,240
you have. So imagine you've just spent

1224
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,280
the first five minutes of your day

1225
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,040
practicing your presence with meditation

1226
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,720
and now just being sat there thinking

1227
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,440
about the good things in your life that

1228
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,280
you appreciate so much.

1229
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,119
What a powerful way to start your day.

1230
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,599
The third mental health habit is

1231
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,680
exercise. And so the type of exercise I

1232
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,680
will always recommend to young men is

1233
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,040
going to the gym and lifting weights. So

1234
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
you've heard of exercise and most people

1235
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,920
when they think about exercise they

1236
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,520
think about just like running, whatever.

1237
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,760
And you can do that if you want. That's

1238
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,480
still nice for you. But I swear to God,

1239
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
I promise you the single best form of

1240
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,760
exercise that you can do when you're

1241
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,000
young and even when you're older is

1242
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,920
resistance training. Basically, lifting

1243
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,040
weights. You go to the gym, you go to

1244
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,800
the weight section, you know, where

1245
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,720
there's those dumbbells and the rack and

1246
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,119
there's like the barbell, the machines,

1247
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,400
and you train with those. When you train

1248
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,079
with those, it will hurt. You know,

1249
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
you'll like do like this chest press and

1250
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,000
it will hurt your chest. But after a

1251
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,760
while of doing that, you'll literally

1252
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,839
build some muscle and your physique will

1253
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,160
look better. And this is the sport of

1254
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,079
bodybuilding, weightlifting. And it I

1255
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,160
promise you, bro, it's so good for you.

1256
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,520
I started 11 years ago. I had like, you

1257
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,520
know, this normal kind of skinny

1258
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,320
physique with a bit of a fat stomach.

1259
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,400
I've built like such a good physique now

1260
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,240
where I get compliments from people all

1261
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,720
the time. I walk into buildings and I

1262
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,640
swear to God the staff who work there

1263
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,319
every single time like these days they

1264
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,640
call me handsome, you know, like they're

1265
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,160
so happy to see me. They ask me to flex

1266
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,880
whatever cuz I've got like a muscular

1267
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,119
physique. I'm 6'1. I weigh about 210 lbs

1268
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,640
now. So I'm [ __ ] big. I'm like a bit,

1269
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,920
you know, like a bulky like kind of high

1270
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,839
body fat right now. But like, you know,

1271
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm like big. It feels not just like for

1272
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,440
the vanity of how you look, but it's

1273
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
just such a good sport because when

1274
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
you're lifting weights, it's all about

1275
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,200
the number you can lift. like okay so I

1276
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,880
can do this bench press for like 20 kg

1277
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,880
for example but if you keep doing it you

1278
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,839
eat right you sleep and you train hard

1279
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,160
next week you can do it for 22.5 kg 25

1280
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,000
kg 30 kg you stick to the same exercise

1281
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,920
let's say it's like the barbell bench

1282
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
press right just like this when you

1283
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,359
first start off like when I did 20 kg

1284
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,480
was too heavy I could probably do about

1285
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,480
10 kg these days I can do about 124 reps

1286
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
so you have imagine it's it's kind of

1287
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,599
like like I'll try and explain this to

1288
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,880
you because I've been doing doing this

1289
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,720
for so long, but just imagine how nice

1290
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,480
this is. Imagine, let's say you're 18

1291
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
right now and you watch this and you

1292
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,760
start weightlifting and there's an

1293
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,319
exercise you can do right now like the

1294
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,119
barbell bench press and you can use 40

1295
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,440
kg on it. You'll still be doing the

1296
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,520
exact same exercise 10, 20 years from

1297
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
now and you'll remember the days where

1298
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,359
you could only do 40 kg but now you can

1299
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,640
do 140, 160 and it's like the exercise

1300
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,400
has like grown alongside you. I was 17

1301
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,040
years old when I first started

1302
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,200
weightlifting and like the the the

1303
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,560
barbell was too heavy for me to press

1304
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,400
like this. You know, I'm lying on my

1305
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,280
back. It was too heavy for me to press

1306
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,160
like this. I've bench pressed three

1307
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,760
plates 140 kg before. So, it's so it's

1308
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,599
like it's not just, you know, you you'll

1309
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,680
look sexy, which by the way is really

1310
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,079
[ __ ] nice. When you look sexy, bro,

1311
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,160
it's so easy to attract girls when

1312
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,359
you've got like a sexy physique and

1313
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,119
also, you know, the confidence that it

1314
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,800
gives you, but also it's just a sport

1315
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,920
that also makes you look forward for the

1316
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,760
future cuz you start and you're like,

1317
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,839
"Oh man, like maybe in like 6 months

1318
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,839
from now, I could bench press like 60 kg

1319
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,280
or 100 kg, you know, and it you start

1320
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,960
like hyping up for the future, thinking,

1321
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,200
oh man, like this sport is it's giving

1322
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,800
me a reason to work hard. You know, if I

1323
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,400
don't quit, I'm going to build like the

1324
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,560
10 out of 10 physique that I've always

1325
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,560
wanted." And it just, bro, it's it's so

1326
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,839
nice when you can walk around shirtless.

1327
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,119
Of course, you know, depending on where

1328
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,319
you live, maybe you live in like a cold

1329
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,560
country, but let's say in the future you

1330
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,319
move to somewhere tropical like Bali,

1331
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,480
you can just walk around shirtless. So,

1332
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,839
I'll I'll drive to the gym on my bike,

1333
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,440
like, and I'll literally just be

1334
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,280
shirtless when I drive. And I swear to

1335
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,560
God, the amount of girls and guys who

1336
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,400
will look over at me, cuz I'm like

1337
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,760
[ __ ] thick and jacked, right? The

1338
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,040
amount of people who look over at me,

1339
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,040
the amount of people who like flex

1340
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,119
whilst they drive past me, it makes me

1341
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,359
feel so [ __ ] nice, man. It's like

1342
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,880
such a great sport. So you start

1343
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,240
exercising, you start lifting weights,

1344
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,000
you start building this physique which

1345
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,599
makes you confident. You get physically

1346
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,280
strong which is so good for your health

1347
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,880
as well. Naturally when you get into

1348
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,000
this you start thinking, okay, I really

1349
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,839
want to make muscle. I want to look

1350
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,440
sexy. So I'll start to sleep better as

1351
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,560
well. I'll start to eat cleaner. I'll

1352
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,400
start to like, you know, like really

1353
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,319
take the gym seriously, conditioning or

1354
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,319
start to like like double down on

1355
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,480
hydration and mindset and everything.

1356
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,160
And so your entire life changes when you

1357
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,680
get into the sport of bodybuilding, like

1358
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,440
of building a physique that you're proud

1359
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,839
of. And remember I told you that having

1360
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,839
the right mindset was really important

1361
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,839
with your mental health habits. There's

1362
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,839
a book that you can read which I always

1363
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,359
recommend to people when they want to

1364
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,480
improve their mental health. And the

1365
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,200
book is called The Magic of Thinking Big

1366
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,280
by David Schwarz. Go and get that book.

1367
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,160
You can go find it online for free.

1368
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,839
Maybe go buy it on Amazon or whatever. I

1369
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,280
promise this is the book that every

1370
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,440
young man should read because it's like

1371
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,280
an old school success book. A lot of

1372
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,200
books these days are written by authors

1373
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,960
that are like left-wing skinny little

1374
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,160
[ __ ] that I'd [ __ ] slap. You know

1375
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,920
what I mean? Like these [ __ ] little

1376
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,359
cowards. And basically they'll write

1377
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,040
books that will tell you like, "Hey,

1378
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,640
don't be so ambitious. You know, live

1379
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
more of a balanced life. It's okay to be

1380
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,760
a loser." I [ __ ] hate books like

1381
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,359
that. This book that I'm recommending to

1382
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,960
you is like an old school book, which is

1383
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
the opposite. It's like this old school

1384
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,880
guy saying that, yeah, you can achieve

1385
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,319
the goal. Work hard. Work even harder.

1386
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,079
You can work harder. You can be

1387
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,599
ambitious. You can achieve any goal that

1388
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,359
you want. That's the kind of mindset

1389
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,960
that you want. Go get that book, The

1390
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,640
Magic of Thinking Big. Start reading it

1391
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,880
and it will really help you with your

1392
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,400
mental health journey. The third step to

1393
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,720
curing depression, and this is linked

1394
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,720
with our first step of setting goals, is

1395
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,319
to choose your purposeful work. So

1396
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,319
remember, we set goals. And one of the

1397
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,400
goals you probably set was, okay, at

1398
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,720
some point I want to make money so I can

1399
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,640
leave my family's home. I can move out.

1400
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,000
I can move to wherever I want. I can

1401
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,720
move to the place in the world where

1402
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,720
people like me are like Bali, Thailand,

1403
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,880
Dubai, these kinds of places where like

1404
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,680
young ambitious people are going. Now is

1405
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,160
the time for you to think about what the

1406
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,920
purposeful work that you could get into.

1407
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,680
What's the mission, the contribution? We

1408
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,599
want to make money. We don't just want

1409
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,440
the money. We want to make the money

1410
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,359
whilst feeling that we are contributing

1411
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,760
to the people that we care about or to

1412
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,280
the cause that we care about. So now is

1413
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,400
the time for you to think, okay, I'm

1414
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,319
going to make money. I'm going to get

1415
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,079
rich. But how do I want to get rich?

1416
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,839
It's not just that I want to make money.

1417
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,440
That's the basic level. The level above

1418
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,200
that is that I want to make money whilst

1419
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,880
I feel like I'm doing good work, that

1420
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,119
I'm helping the kind of people or the

1421
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,599
cause or the mission that I really feel

1422
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,319
is important. So ask yourself right now,

1423
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,560
if you were already a billionaire,

1424
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,800
who would you help? What kind of person

1425
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,119
could you help and do you want to help?

1426
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,599
What problem in the world pisses you off

1427
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,359
a lot? It could be porn addiction in

1428
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,119
men. It could be loneliness. It could be

1429
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,520
mental health like I'm doing here. It

1430
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,920
could be social skills or men's dating

1431
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,160
skills. It could be the environment. It

1432
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,160
could be microlastics like you know like

1433
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,400
recycling. It could be the climate. It

1434
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,160
could be animals. What is it that really

1435
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,000
like makes you so sad and you're like

1436
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,720
man I wish that problem went away in the

1437
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,400
world. Let's say for me it was helping

1438
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,079
young men. When I started this work 5

1439
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
years ago, I saw that young men were at

1440
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,680
such a disadvantage in society. Women

1441
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,440
have been hyped up for the last few

1442
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,440
decades told that you can do anything

1443
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,800
you want. You go girl, you can go get

1444
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,720
the degree. You can work. You can do

1445
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,119
anything that a man can. Men have been

1446
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,119
told, "Stop being violent. Stop

1447
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,720
mansplaining. Stop doing this. Stop

1448
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,000
doing that. Stop making women do this."

1449
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,720
And blah blah blah blah blah. We've been

1450
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,760
told all bad things about us. Men have

1451
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,599
been told to sit down, shut the [ __ ] up,

1452
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,119
and just sacrifice yourself when you're

1453
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,440
needed. But right now, you're not

1454
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,280
needed, so we don't like you. I saw this

1455
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,280
and it pissed me off. Even when I was

1456
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,040
like a teenager, men's issues would

1457
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,040
really get to me because every time it

1458
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,480
was spoke about, some [ __ ] girl in my

1459
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,440
class would hype up and say, "Yeah, but

1460
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,720
girls have got this other thing." And

1461
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,079
I'd be like, "Bitch, just let us [ __ ]

1462
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,520
like talk about the fact that men are

1463
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,280
killing themselves at four times the

1464
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,560
rate than women. Let us talk about the

1465
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
fact that most of the homeless in the

1466
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,079
world are men. Let us talk about the

1467
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,680
fact that most of the people who die in

1468
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,040
the workplace are men. Let us talk about

1469
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,720
the fact that most of the people who've

1470
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,040
got a terrible mental health, who are

1471
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,960
suicidal, are men." But we can't because

1472
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,640
the moment we speak about these things,

1473
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,920
we suddenly have to translate it into

1474
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,400
women and say, "Oh, yeah, but women have

1475
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,319
got shut the [ __ ] up." This like zero

1476
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,079
someum empathy. When we're speaking

1477
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,839
about men's issues, we have to say,

1478
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,520
"Yeah, but you know, women have it bad,

1479
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,359
too." No. How about we just [ __ ]

1480
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,440
focus on the men for once? Throughout

1481
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,720
our [ __ ] generation, men have been

1482
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,680
left behind. Did you know that men

1483
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,319
perform worse in every year of the

1484
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,160
education system? Women go to university

1485
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,480
and get degrees more. Did you know

1486
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,839
remember the the phrase the gender wage

1487
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,680
gap? Did you know that that was a

1488
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,800
[ __ ] lie that men earn more than

1489
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,040
women? Did you know that that was

1490
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,800
literally a lie and women literally earn

1491
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,640
more than men? And when the real

1492
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,720
statistics came out, when the real data

1493
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,560
came out, the feminists went quiet. They

1494
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,480
always told us that feminism was for

1495
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,160
equality. The moment it came out with

1496
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,839
real data that women make more money

1497
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,760
than men, feminists have just shut the

1498
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,119
[ __ ] up about the gender wage gap. If

1499
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,400
they care about men, they should be

1500
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,240
talking about the gender wage gap and

1501
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,760
saying, "Oh, women earn more than men.

1502
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
We've got to bring the men up. But they

1503
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,839
don't give a [ __ ] about men. Nobody

1504
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,440
does. They don't give a [ __ ] about us.

1505
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,119
So, I saw this as you can see right now

1506
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,880
and I get pissed. I see the [ __ ]

1507
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,640
inequality of the world. I see how how

1508
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,319
left behind men have been. And if you

1509
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,000
talk about men's issues, suddenly people

1510
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,920
just think you're like a misogynist. You

1511
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,880
hate women or some [ __ ] I saw this. It

1512
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,359
pissed me off and I was like, you know

1513
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,599
what? Look, you can get rich doing

1514
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,000
anything. but you may as well get rich

1515
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,240
whilst also focusing on the problem that

1516
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,319
you genuinely want to work on because

1517
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,760
you'll just work 10 times harder on it.

1518
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,119
So, I thought to myself, you know what?

1519
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,400
I'm going to take on the problems of

1520
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,839
young men. I'm going to try and help

1521
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
young men. I'm going to educate them.

1522
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,040
I'm going to be like a leader for young

1523
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,480
men. And I've worked so hard and I've

1524
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,559
been so dedicated to this that of course

1525
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,319
I got successful whilst doing this. So,

1526
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,079
you need to do something similar. You

1527
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,400
need to think to yourself, okay, what is

1528
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,800
the problem, the cause, the mission that

1529
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,720
spikes something inside of you? Focus on

1530
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,000
that. that is like your career, your

1531
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,079
business. That's the way that you can

1532
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,920
make money in the world. Just for now,

1533
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,280
you don't have to have the complete idea

1534
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,280
because it's something that you'll kind

1535
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,200
of discover over a few months of like

1536
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,200
getting into it. But just as a start,

1537
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
just think about what type of person you

1538
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,319
might want to help and just think about

1539
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,920
what type of problem you might want to

1540
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,280
help them with. And then just think,

1541
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,359
okay, well, what are the ways I can do

1542
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,280
that? I can educate the people who are

1543
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,960
going through that problem with social

1544
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,559
media content. Let's say your the

1545
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
problem that you want to get rid of in

1546
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,680
the world is like porn addiction in men.

1547
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,760
and you think, "Okay, well, I could

1548
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,280
become like a nofap YouTuber and after a

1549
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,880
few years, I might have like hundreds of

1550
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,559
thousands of subscribers and I've gotten

1551
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,240
like hundreds of thousands of guys to

1552
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,319
quit porn." That's like, bro, that's

1553
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,920
[ __ ] good contribution to the world

1554
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,000
that you've just done. And you'll get

1555
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,400
rich at the same time. Once you've got

1556
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,800
that, the fourth step to curing

1557
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,440
depression is such a simple one, but

1558
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,960
it's so powerful.

1559
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,200
Smile. This is such a powerful hack.

1560
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,800
Smile. When you go through your normal

1561
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,400
day, you wake up, you're about to

1562
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,079
meditate, you're about to work on

1563
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,520
something, you're going to go to school

1564
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,960
or work, you're going to the grocery

1565
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,800
store, going to the gym, whatever you're

1566
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,240
doing, we'll often just be in our mind.

1567
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,640
We'll just be thinking about what we

1568
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,079
have to do. Okay, I've got a chore, I've

1569
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,200
got to do this thing, okay, I'm going to

1570
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,599
get to the gym, I'm going to do this,

1571
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,760
whatever. I swear this is so powerful.

1572
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,000
As many times as possible in the day,

1573
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,839
just remind yourself to smile. And

1574
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,800
literally, even though there's no reason

1575
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,520
to smile, just force the muscles of your

1576
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,880
face to smile. Just force them like

1577
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,960
this. Within a few seconds, it will

1578
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,880
often turn to a real smile. You can do

1579
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,440
it right now. Just fake fake a big

1580
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,839
[ __ ] toothy smile right now. Just

1581
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,640
fake it for a second and allow it to

1582
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,720
just like kind of like introduce that

1583
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,319
feeling. There's real studies that have

1584
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,720
shown that if you just fake a smile,

1585
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,960
you're very likely to genuinely feel

1586
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,960
happier because it is actually the

1587
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,839
commands that we give to our body that

1588
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,079
changes how we feel inside. The biggest

1589
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,800
lie is thinking that you need to feel

1590
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,240
happy to smile. That's what most people

1591
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,760
think, right? They'll smile when there's

1592
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,119
something to smile about, so we need

1593
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,400
something to smile about first. No, no,

1594
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,760
no. I promise this is such an

1595
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,520
interesting mindset. That's not how it

1596
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,040
works. You don't smile because there's

1597
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,079
something to smile about. No, no, no.

1598
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,400
You smile and then you get things to

1599
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,160
smile about. You smile then someone like

1600
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,839
a girl smiles at you and then you've got

1601
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,920
something to actually smile about. You

1602
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,599
smile and everyone seems happier to you

1603
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,359
that day and now you're actually a

1604
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,800
happier person. You don't wait for

1605
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,400
something to happen to smile because

1606
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,599
then you just won't smile that much. You

1607
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,440
become the type of person who just

1608
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,960
smiles as much as possible and then

1609
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,240
people will smile back at you. Bro, when

1610
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,839
you're smiling through the day in the

1611
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,119
gym, whatever, you'll notice so many

1612
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,480
more people will smile at you rather

1613
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,079
than you being in like a normal kind of

1614
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,599
face. You know, it's so rare for someone

1615
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,800
to smile at you when you're in a normal

1616
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,559
face. You're kind of thinking about

1617
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,319
life, whatever. I promise if you become

1618
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,920
the type of person who just f like you

1619
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,160
remind yourself a hundred times every

1620
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,680
day to smile, smile, smile, smile. You

1621
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,880
have it on your phone and checklist like

1622
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,319
you have a checklist for getting ready

1623
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,520
for the gym, you have a checklist for

1624
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,720
getting ready for work, you have a

1625
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,319
checklist for getting ready for school,

1626
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,160
and you know, you take off each one. I

1627
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,079
promise if you have smile there like 10

1628
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,480
times and it's like, okay, history

1629
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,839
class, smile, gym, like you walk into

1630
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,599
the gym, smile. You know, it's like a

1631
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,760
little checklist you press on your phone

1632
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,280
notes app every day. I promise you start

1633
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,119
smiling more. More people will smile at

1634
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
you and you'll just get so many more

1635
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,559
opportunities. You'll have so many more

1636
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,200
reasons to smile. It's like one of the

1637
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,200
best hacks against feeling depressed is

1638
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,200
just forcing yourself to smile,

1639
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,880
reminding yourself to smile, even if

1640
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,720
there feels like there's nothing to

1641
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,000
smile about. There'll be some guy here

1642
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,520
who's watching this thinking, "Oh, well

1643
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,520
that's just stupid because you need a

1644
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,359
reason to smile." No, you don't. Smiling

1645
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,440
doesn't require a reason. It just

1646
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,680
requires contractions of your muscle, of

1647
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:05,040
your face. Do I need a reason to to flex

1648
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,800
my bicep like this? No, I can just flex

1649
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,720
it. How about can you move your eyebrows

1650
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,599
up? Can you do that? Right, do this with

1651
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,760
me. Right, you can do that. Right. So,

1652
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,559
just like we can move our eyebrows up,

1653
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,960
we can also just smile our lips. And it

1654
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,559
feels a bit silly, but just do it and

1655
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,559
just feel the goofiness of it, the

1656
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,400
absurdity of faking a smile. And it'll

1657
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,920
often just turn into a real [ __ ]

1658
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,359
smile. And then it'll get you into the

1659
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,119
moods where when I I by the way I do

1660
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,400
this. I smile as soon as I wake up,

1661
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,559
right? I try to like always remember

1662
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,079
that when I'm driving to the gym, I

1663
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,160
smile. What will happen is you'll start

1664
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,319
to actually get into a good mood because

1665
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,920
whatever we do to our body changes how

1666
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,680
we feel, right? Imagine if I told you to

1667
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,599
sit small like this. You'll start to

1668
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,760
feel more anxious and whatever. When you

1669
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,119
sit bigger and you take up more space,

1670
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,559
you start to feel better. You start to

1671
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,319
feel more confident. One, because your

1672
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,760
body starts getting this message of, oh

1673
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,680
yeah, he's a confident guy. But also

1674
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,680
two, people start treating you with more

1675
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,520
confidence. If if someone saw me sit

1676
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,040
like this, they'd think, "Oh, yeah, this

1677
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,800
guy's a bit more confident." Just in

1678
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,559
their subconscious mind, and they'd

1679
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,920
treat me like that. If I was like this,

1680
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,240
they'd treat me worse. If I'm like this,

1681
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,319
they'll treat me better. Likewise, if I

1682
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,240
smile, more people will smile back at

1683
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,160
me, which will give me a reason to smile

1684
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,440
again. So, as many times as possible,

1685
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,359
set like alarms on your phone,

1686
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,880
checklists on your phone, reminders,

1687
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,880
whatever. Get into the habit and just

1688
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,400
smile, smile, smile, smile. Get like a

1689
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,720
few people you see all the time, like

1690
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,400
this girl in school or this teacher or

1691
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,880
your mom, whatever. And always think to

1692
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,559
yourself, smile before they just about

1693
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,240
when they see you. Just be the guy who

1694
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,520
smiles so much more. And if by the way,

1695
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,280
you're going to the same environment,

1696
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,960
like school for example, and you're not

1697
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,400
really the smiley kind of guy, just

1698
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,599
start anyway. I know it might seem a bit

1699
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,760
weird. Oh, no, but you know, I've kind

1700
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,040
of set the the vibe that I don't smile

1701
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,880
when I open the door to like my

1702
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,240
classroom. But you can, and girls will

1703
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,440
be like, "Oh, you you look happy today."

1704
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,800
They'll literally speak to you. It's

1705
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,160
easy for you to speak to them and

1706
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,440
they'll say, "Oh, you're smiling. You've

1707
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,559
got a nice smile. You look happy today."

1708
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,079
And say, "Oh, thank you. Like, how was

1709
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,040
your weekend?" And just have a chitchat

1710
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,640
with them. You don't have to think like,

1711
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,720
"Oh, yeah, but you know, I've I've kept

1712
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,400
up the aura that I'm not the smiley guy.

1713
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm actually the nonchalant." Stop being

1714
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,760
[ __ ] gay, bro. I'm actually the

1715
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,520
nonchalant type of guy. Stop being a

1716
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,440
[ __ ] internet addict, bro. Oh, I'm

1717
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,480
nonchal Shut up. You look like a [ __ ]

1718
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,800
like the nonchalant guy who's trying to

1719
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,559
act serious. You You look like

1720
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,720
unwelcoming to people who want to speak

1721
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,720
to you. When you smile, it's so easy for

1722
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,640
other people to come up to you, to wave

1723
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,000
at you, and smile back at you. And also

1724
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,440
what helps by the way again the same

1725
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,119
thing when you move to the type of place

1726
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,720
where a lot of people are just smiling.

1727
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,559
I swear to God where I live is like the

1728
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,480
land of the smiles. You walk into a cafe

1729
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,480
all the staff are smiling like genuine

1730
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,640
not like commercial kind of American

1731
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,240
style but they're like genuinely happy

1732
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,839
people here. You go to the gym there'll

1733
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,240
be girls who walk past smiling and

1734
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,000
everything. Become so easy to talk to

1735
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,000
people. Now that you've got your goals,

1736
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,440
the mental health habits, you know the

1737
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,960
direction you're going to. You've got a

1738
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,359
bit of a mission to work on and you're

1739
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,760
smiling. The fifth step to curing

1740
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,760
depression is to get into more of a

1741
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,040
playful mood. This is why smiling is so

1742
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,960
important. Do you remember as children,

1743
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,040
we used to just have like this playful

1744
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,520
energy throughout the day. We'd see like

1745
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,680
a puddle on the floor and we wouldn't

1746
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,119
walk around it. We just randomly stomp

1747
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,599
through it and our pants would get a bit

1748
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,440
wet or we try and jump over the puddle.

1749
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,880
Imagine you were in like the the forest

1750
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,799
or the woods or whatever and there was a

1751
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,319
bit of a ditch like this. You and your

1752
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,240
friends would just like randomly just

1753
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,240
sprint and decide to jump over it rather

1754
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,000
than walk around it. You'd see a tree

1755
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,440
and you just climb it. You'd pick up

1756
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,119
something from the floor and you just

1757
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
randomly throw it to somewhere. You'd

1758
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,640
grab a leaf from the tree and look at it

1759
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,079
and tear it into little pieces,

1760
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,839
whatever. You do all these things. You'd

1761
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,839
play. You'd integrate with nature, with

1762
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,359
society. When we become older, we just

1763
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,280
kind of stop doing all that. We just put

1764
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,720
our AirPods in, we just walk to like

1765
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,640
school or work and we just don't

1766
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,319
interact with the world anymore. We see

1767
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,000
a puddle, we walk around it. We see a

1768
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,520
tree that would be great for climbing

1769
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,799
and we just walk straight past it. Why?

1770
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,799
You know, as adults, like we're supposed

1771
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,880
to still live the exact same life. Like,

1772
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,960
adults are still meant to play the exact

1773
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,720
same way that we were as children. Why

1774
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,319
don't we do those things anymore? Come

1775
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,160
on. It's embarrassing to admit because

1776
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,760
we're scared of being seen as corny, you

1777
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,520
know, by those same [ __ ] internet

1778
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,640
trolls who'd say that you're corny

1779
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,000
because you feel like you've got a

1780
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,079
mission in life. They'd be like, "Ah,

1781
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,680
that's so so corny. Bro, bro's got a

1782
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,520
purpose for his existence." Like,

1783
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,680
they'll be talking in memes. Bro's got a

1784
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,680
mission in life before GTA 6. They'll

1785
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,200
just be saying this cringe [ __ ] this

1786
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,119
internet [ __ ] the type of people who

1787
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,200
will comment like first on these [ __ ]

1788
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,960
videos, these [ __ ] like like come on

1789
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,599
internet [ __ ] retards, right, bro?

1790
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,799
We've got Hamza mental health guide

1791
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,720
before GTA 6. Bro, that [ __ ] meme

1792
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,160
comment has never been funny. And the

1793
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,359
type of people who comment like this,

1794
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,200
they've literally like they're so

1795
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,480
depressed and so not funny people,

1796
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,880
right? So the type of people who will

1797
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,319
judge you saying like ah Unks corn he

1798
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,880
was you know whatever [ __ ] that they'll

1799
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,319
say if they ever see you like climbing a

1800
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,839
tree they're depressed taking

1801
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,440
anti-depressant pills and their uncle

1802
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,880
probably rapes them so like who the [ __ ]

1803
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,400
cares about what some [ __ ] kid is

1804
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,599
going to say about you if he sees you

1805
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,079
like randomly you're walking and you

1806
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,480
jump over a puddle just jumped over the

1807
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,680
puddle. It's like

1808
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,960
you sound like a [ __ ] [ __ ] right?

1809
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,760
So don't worry about any of these

1810
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,680
[ __ ] dead rose emoji kids who judge

1811
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,280
you. That's the reason why we won't do

1812
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,720
these playful things anymore. That's the

1813
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,160
reason why when you see a tree that

1814
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,520
would be great for climbing, you

1815
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,880
wouldn't do it cuz you're scared that

1816
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,640
someone else from your school or some

1817
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,160
[ __ ] kid would see you and put like

1818
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,799
take a picture of you and say like, "Oh

1819
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,160
yeah, he's climbing a tree." Like

1820
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:20,079
enjoying nature.

1821
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,000
Okay. Why are you scared of these

1822
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,440
[ __ ] little trolls? Why are you

1823
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,880
scared of them? Rely, when you think

1824
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,400
about it, overall your life will be

1825
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,000
better. This is particularly, you know,

1826
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,280
to the generation Z or X or whatever,

1827
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,480
the kids who are watching this who are

1828
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,280
like under 18 years old. You guys are so

1829
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,040
scared of like getting publicly outed

1830
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,119
for doing anything that can be seen as

1831
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,359
cringe or corny. Like I feel so bad for

1832
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,240
the young generation cuz you're so

1833
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:48,480
scared of behaving in a way where people

1834
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,240
will like judge you. In my generation,

1835
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,720
like we got, you know, Snapchat and

1836
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,119
Instagram when we were like 16, 17 years

1837
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,160
old, but these days, kids are so like

1838
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,599
[ __ ] like they'll call, you know,

1839
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,520
they'll just [ __ ] chat [ __ ] about

1840
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,359
each other and say, "Oh, he's so corny.

1841
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,880
He's this, whatever." So now, every kid

1842
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,960
that I speak to who's like younger than

1843
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,319
16, they're so scared of being

1844
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,640
different. Like they all have the same

1845
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,240
like Tik Tok haircut. They all have the

1846
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,839
same taste in music. They're all like

1847
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,000
little sheep, like little bots going

1848
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,359
through the same [ __ ] NPC like hole

1849
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,280
in the wall. Because if you're different

1850
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,799
as a young person, everyone else will

1851
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,319
say like, "Oh, he's so corny. He's

1852
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,680
trying to be a content creator." But

1853
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,599
it's like, bro, like, what do you lose

1854
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,280
by some [ __ ] [ __ ] saying this about

1855
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,520
you? That guy's not getting his dick

1856
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,040
sucked. He's a [ __ ] little loser. So,

1857
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,400
like, who gives a [ __ ] about these

1858
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,440
[ __ ] kids who will say [ __ ] right?

1859
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,119
And if you're older, then you shouldn't

1860
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,400
even give a [ __ ] anyway. Like, and you

1861
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,000
know, I said before, you should care

1862
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,280
what people think about you. Obviously,

1863
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,799
what I meant was like you should care

1864
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,079
what like [ __ ] intelligent people

1865
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,599
think about you, what some high

1866
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,200
performers, some successful people, not

1867
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,200
some [ __ ] you know, some [ __ ] from

1868
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,880
your class who who's going to post about

1869
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,760
you on Snapchat saying like, "Oh, I saw

1870
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,200
him climbing a [ __ ] tree. That's so

1871
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,400
cringe or something. Who gives a [ __ ]

1872
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,680
about these kids, right? Who gives a

1873
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,359
[ __ ] about these little retards?" So,

1874
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,119
the fifth step of curing depression is

1875
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,599
for you to start acting like a child

1876
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,119
again in this playful energy. Go climb a

1877
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,559
tree. Like, seriously, imagine that was

1878
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,640
like a part of your daily habits, like

1879
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,720
your checklist. Climb a tree. You go on

1880
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,079
a walk or a bit of a run every day. You

1881
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,680
find a tree like you're looking around

1882
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,200
for a good tree to climb and you climb

1883
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,319
it as high as you possibly can. I

1884
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,680
promise you can't be depressed when

1885
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,680
you're climbing a tree. You just can't.

1886
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,799
I guarantee you'll start smiling. You'll

1887
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,319
start like, you know, breathing heavies

1888
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,760
like a little kid. Like you're trying to

1889
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,760
like figure out which which one to go on

1890
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,440
to next. I guarantee, bro, you go climb

1891
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,040
a tree today. It's better than taking

1892
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,799
anti-depressants. I guarantee you. All

1893
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,960
the decades of training that all these

1894
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,839
[ __ ] gay little therapists have

1895
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,200
trained for in university, all the

1896
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,880
billions of dollars that these like

1897
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,799
pharmaceutical companies have spent on

1898
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,559
anti-depressants and all this [ __ ] And

1899
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,319
climbing a tree is literally better than

1900
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,319
all of it put together. Just go climb a

1901
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,319
tree next time it's raining. Go for a

1902
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,240
[ __ ] run outside in the rain. Go

1903
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,839
shirtless. Whenever there's a puddle on

1904
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,359
the floor, jump over the puddle. I

1905
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,200
guarantee you do these. I know it sounds

1906
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,880
so silly. This is how you stop feeling

1907
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,040
depressed. you start having this

1908
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,400
childlike playful energy. You're like,

1909
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,160
you know, you're making noises. You're

1910
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,359
randomly playing games with yourself.

1911
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,880
Best case scenario, you've got someone

1912
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,559
else to do this with. If you've got some

1913
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,079
friends in the same vibe, you can

1914
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,440
randomly wrestle with them. Let's say

1915
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,960
you all go to the park to like play

1916
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,079
football together and you randomly just

1917
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,440
grab one of your friends and you start

1918
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,280
like wrestling each other and stuff. And

1919
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,040
again, it's like some [ __ ] kid who's

1920
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,559
depressed has to take anti-depressants

1921
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,760
and he gets raped by his uncle is like

1922
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,520
watching you guys taking like a little

1923
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,680
picture of you saying like so corny.

1924
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,000
These guys are wrestling before GTA 6

1925
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,760
came out. It's like just you're [ __ ]

1926
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,680
internet [ __ ] re GTA 6 oh corny dead

1927
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,760
ros like just shut up man all this

1928
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,839
shit's so gay now like the people who

1929
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,520
say corny the people who write in these

1930
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,200
memes are the corny [ __ ]

1931
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,280
themselves right we're getting to a nice

1932
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,440
part of society where basically there's

1933
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,799
the two splits of people there's the

1934
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,559
superhumans who are going to start to

1935
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,079
live in the ways that I'm describing and

1936
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,839
then there's the subhumans who whose

1937
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,920
entire personality is built of like the

1938
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:50,319
[ __ ] Tik Tok and Instagram comments

1939
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,880
and they know what to to call someone

1940
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,720
corny for or what meme is is popular

1941
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,480
these days or something like we had

1942
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,640
memes back in my time but it was like a

1943
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,480
[ __ ] like dog meme or some [ __ ] or

1944
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,480
like bad luck Brian or some [ __ ] you

1945
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,839
know it was like [ __ ] just a JPEG or

1946
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,359
something these days like there's just

1947
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,640
kids who are like so hyperconnected to

1948
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,160
the internet they'll try and mock you

1949
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,839
for like like you know the way you're

1950
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,160
living but these kids are [ __ ] like

1951
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,760
little weirdos anyway so why who gives a

1952
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,359
[ __ ] about what some [ __ ] kid

1953
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,440
comments so these days if I see a kid

1954
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,720
comment some [ __ ] like fell off I always

1955
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,960
just reply with the same thing I'm like

1956
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,799
grow up You're a [ __ ] sane on society.

1957
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,200
You're like a [ __ ] weird internet

1958
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,040
consumer. The gray matter in your brain

1959
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,880
is deteriorating from your consumption

1960
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,960
of of [ __ ] internet content. This

1961
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,400
culture online where someone will [ __ ]

1962
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,720
on you for being a productive human

1963
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,760
being. So cringe. I think the people who

1964
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,359
say cringe corny GTA 6 whatever the [ __ ]

1965
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,960
these kids are talking about. I think

1966
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,839
that's the corny thing. Like someone

1967
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,920
will trim this up. Unks angry about GTA.

1968
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:48,079
Like shut up. Stop this internet bro.

1969
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,680
It's so cringe the way people talk

1970
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,200
online. You know, if you go and live a

1971
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,880
healthy life, if you start going to the

1972
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,160
gym, there'll be someone in your school

1973
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,160
who'll start saying this about you.

1974
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,319
Like, ah, Unks going to the gym before

1975
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,839
G. Just shut up. You [ __ ] You get my

1976
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,280
point, right? I'm probably not using the

1977
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,599
lingo correctly, but you get my point.

1978
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:06,319
Like, you're so scared of what these

1979
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,000
genuine genuine mental disability people

1980
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,839
are going to say about you. Who gives a

1981
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,960
[ __ ] bro? If you go to the gym, they'll

1982
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,640
make fun of you. If you don't go to the

1983
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,920
gym, they'll make fun of you. If you're

1984
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,280
poor, they'll make fun of you. If you're

1985
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,880
rich, they'll make fun of you. So,

1986
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,640
clearly, their [ __ ] judgment of you

1987
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,160
is just [ __ ] useless. Like who gives

1988
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,680
a [ __ ] You should think about your own

1989
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,960
judgment of yourself. And also, this is

1990
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,880
what's controversial, but I think it's

1991
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,640
good. You should think about what some

1992
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,079
highlevel people would judge you on.

1993
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,680
Let's say me, right? Maybe I'm like a

1994
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,440
role model in your life. You should

1995
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,359
think to yourself, how would Hamza judge

1996
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,039
me if I go to the gym today? He'd nod

1997
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,400
his head and think, okay, sweet. He went

1998
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,079
to the gym. Respect. You should be,

1999
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,240
okay, well, I'll go to the gym. Not not

2000
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,680
just for Hamza, but because he's maybe

2001
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,160
like I may be someone that you kind of

2002
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,359
look up to. I'm 28 years old. I'm a

2003
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,200
millionaire. I've got millions of

2004
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,480
followers. I'm a happy guy. I've got a

2005
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,760
great physique. I've got good social

2006
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,520
life, good dating life, bro. I've

2007
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,680
achieved like basically every young

2008
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,119
man's dream in my [ __ ] 20ies. Most

2009
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,480
guys don't even become a millionaire in

2010
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,480
their life. I became a millionaire in

2011
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,760
like four years of trying, right? That's

2012
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,920
pretty like come on glaze. Just shut up,

2013
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,280
bro. [ __ ] hell. Oh, don't just shut

2014
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,480
up this [ __ ] internet. But you get my

2015
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,599
point, right? So, I've achieved a lot.

2016
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,520
So, you should be thinking to yourself

2017
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,440
like, okay, what would Hamza think if he

2018
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,640
saw me climbing a tree or if he saw me,

2019
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,480
you know, being like this happy guy

2020
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,000
who's speaking to like the elderly

2021
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,520
person you walk past having a

2022
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,440
conversation with them? Hamza would

2023
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,480
respect me for it. Okay, well then I'm

2024
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,559
going to do more of that. What would

2025
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,640
Hamza think if he heard that I went for

2026
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,400
a run in the rain? He'd respect me for

2027
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,240
it. When you think too much about your

2028
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,359
social circle and you know the internet,

2029
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,880
you'll be thinking, okay, what would

2030
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,559
they think if I went for a run in the

2031
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,480
rain? And you just kind of visualize the

2032
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,160
type of comments. Ah, bro thinks he's

2033
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,440
the main character cuz he went for a run

2034
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,640
in the rain or some [ __ ] And it's like,

2035
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,240
yeah, you'll start to get scared, but

2036
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,160
you've got to remember the people who

2037
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,720
will judge you for living like a playful

2038
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,280
life, they're all depressed. So don't

2039
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,400
allow their judgment to change your

2040
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,079
actions. Try not to think about their

2041
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,079
judgment at all. Try to think of the

2042
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,599
judgment of people who are at where you

2043
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,200
want to be in life. What would those

2044
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,960
retards say if you tried to make a

2045
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,480
business? They'd insult you and they'd

2046
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,319
call you names. What would the

2047
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,160
businessman say if you tried to make a

2048
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,680
business? He'd respect you and he'd want

2049
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,240
to help you. So even though this is such

2050
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,319
a simple step, step number five, be more

2051
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,160
playful. You can see it's quite a big

2052
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,160
thing because we are supposed to be

2053
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,400
playful creatures. We're supposed to be

2054
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,839
silly. We're supposed to goof around and

2055
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,319
play, fight, and wrestle, you know, just

2056
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,760
like lions do. Lion cubs, but also the

2057
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:21,520
big lions, they'll just playfully

2058
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,359
wrestle each other. Dogs do this. All

2059
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,440
kinds of animals do this. We're supposed

2060
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,720
to just play. But people will judge you

2061
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,400
for this. And I'm telling you, the big

2062
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,480
reason why a lot of us feel depressed is

2063
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,480
we're so restrained in our behavior

2064
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,799
because we're so scared of how people

2065
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,039
will judge us. Step number six to curing

2066
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,880
depression is to improve your social and

2067
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,880
your dating life. When you are socially

2068
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,039
isolated from other guys and when you're

2069
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,799
not good at like flirting with girls,

2070
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,799
you start to get quite reserved in

2071
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,200
inside of yourself, you start to feel

2072
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,520
really bad. You overthink. You get

2073
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,599
anxiety when you've got a great social

2074
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,440
circle around you. And when you're good

2075
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,680
with women, you get this extra level of

2076
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,520
confidence that really makes like life

2077
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,640
so much more enjoyable. And I know what

2078
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,400
you're probably thinking is like, "Oh,

2079
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,000
well, you know, girls are a distraction.

2080
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,520
I don't really care right now." You and

2081
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,280
I both know that's [ __ ] You and I

2082
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,119
both know that if there was a girl who

2083
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,400
was genuinely into you, you'd be so

2084
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,680
happy. So don't [ __ ] and say like,

2085
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,039
"Oh, well, I don't care about girls.

2086
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,640
They're just a distraction." Because if

2087
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,160
you're actually honest, you'd love to

2088
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,680
like go on a date with a funny girl

2089
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,039
right now. You'd You'd actually love it,

2090
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,559
right? It's so easy for us to say like,

2091
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,000
"Yeah, I don't care about girls." What

2092
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,680
we really mean is like, "Yeah, I'm not

2093
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,280
really attracting girls right now, so

2094
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,119
I'll just pretend that I don't care

2095
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,960
about them." When actually I do. I'm

2096
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,160
just not very good at like attracting a

2097
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,200
girl right now. And there's nothing

2098
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,359
wrong with saying that, right? If

2099
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,799
anything, admitting to yourself that you

2100
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,559
do want a girlfriend or you do want to

2101
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:38,240
go and flirt with some girls and you

2102
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,680
want to make some friends is actually

2103
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,280
such a positive thing because then

2104
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,880
you'll actually have the desire for it

2105
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,119
more and more and more. So to make

2106
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,359
progress here, you've got to become the

2107
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,280
kind of guy who girls are actually

2108
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,640
attracted to. And it's not as simple as

2109
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,559
just like, you know, build a physique

2110
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,400
and do some looks maxing and get some

2111
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,799
nice hair or anything. A lot of it is

2112
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,119
about understanding female nature and

2113
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,720
becoming the the bad boy that girls

2114
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,799
actually want. It's like girls want two

2115
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,640
kinds of guys. They want the bad boy and

2116
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,200
they want the nice guy. They want the

2117
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,480
nice guy to text to become more like a

2118
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,559
friend with. You know, the nice guy,

2119
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,640
you've probably been him, is the one who

2120
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,720
the girl will text and Snapchat and get

2121
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,240
like Snapchat streaks with, but she

2122
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,839
won't suck his dick. You probably have a

2123
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,920
couple girls who actually see you as a

2124
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,920
nice guy right now. They'll text you.

2125
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,920
They appreciate the friendship that you

2126
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,520
have, but they're actually getting

2127
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,720
[ __ ] by someone else. You might be

2128
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,760
thinking, "No, no, not the girl I'm

2129
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,680
speaking to." Yes, bro. Yes, they want

2130
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,039
the nice guy and the bad boy. And if

2131
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,079
we're being honest, most guys when I

2132
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,440
tell them this, they're like, "Okay,

2133
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,880
Hamster, tell me how to be the bad boy.

2134
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,240
I completely get what you mean. I've

2135
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,000
been the nice guy before. I've been like

2136
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,839
the friend." And it's like, I don't want

2137
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,119
to be in that [ __ ] role. I'd rather

2138
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:45,200
be the guy that these girls are coming

2139
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,559
to to [ __ ] right? That you know that

2140
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,240
they're really obsessed with. How do you

2141
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,680
be the bad boy? You've got to understand

2142
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,680
female nature. You've got to understand

2143
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,119
how to flirt and how to carry that sort

2144
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:58,720
of whole personality. This is why I made

2145
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,559
a entire like sixh hour course on how to

2146
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,760
be the bad boy. I'll put it as the top

2147
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,960
link in the description. It's like my

2148
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,280
program where you get like a ton of

2149
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,440
courses. But one of the courses in there

2150
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,960
is a full guide. It's called like the

2151
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,799
red pill course. It's a full guide on

2152
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,720
becoming the bad boy that the girls

2153
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,160
actually want to [ __ ] So you take that

2154
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,680
course, you learn and you start getting

2155
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,640
way better in your dating life. And

2156
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,920
again, this is kind of like the

2157
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,440
weightlifting, you know, the exercise

2158
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,880
that I told you where it makes you kind

2159
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,400
of happy for the future because you see

2160
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,319
yourself in the future getting better

2161
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,799
and better with girls. And now the

2162
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,560
seventh and the final step to curing

2163
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,600
depression, putting this all together.

2164
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,279
You know, we've covered a bunch of

2165
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,839
steps, but it's time to put it all

2166
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,960
together. The seventh step is to write

2167
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:38,799
down a timetable, a daily routine,

2168
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,799
putting everything that we spoke about

2169
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,319
into one place, and then you can stick

2170
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,640
to it as best as possible. Do you

2171
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,480
remember in school we had like a timet

2172
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,359
where you would see okay 9:00 a.m. we

2173
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,600
start 10:00 a.m. we have maths 11:30 we

2174
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,359
have lunch 12 we have science whatever

2175
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,239
it was like a timet right you should

2176
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,159
have a timet for your dayto-day life so

2177
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:00,960
for example you might write down 5:00

2178
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:04,719
a.m. wake up and morning routine 5:30

2179
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,759
meditate 6 a.m. read 7 a.m. gym 9:00

2180
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,120
a.m. school 400 p.m. come home and eat

2181
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,799
5:00 p.m. gym, whatever. You get my

2182
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,199
point. You But just plot out the

2183
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,120
dayto-day life of what we're going to do

2184
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,480
on the best day possible. So, you can do

2185
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,239
this on your phone where you can just

2186
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,159
have like a, you know, wrote it down

2187
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:22,000
5:00 a.m., 6 a.m., whatever. You can do

2188
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,359
this on like Google calendar. You can do

2189
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,120
this on a piece of paper, but just

2190
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,960
somewhere you should have your daily

2191
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,080
routine written out. So, you know that,

2192
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,520
for example, you're going to wake up and

2193
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,560
do that morning routine, which I told

2194
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,400
you about where you're going to meditate

2195
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,839
and do the gratitude journaling first

2196
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,199
thing when you wake up. Then you might

2197
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,560
need to get ready for school or work and

2198
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,159
you're there for a good few hours. Then

2199
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,080
you'll come back. What time will you go

2200
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:41,759
to the gym? What time will you eat? You

2201
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,679
plot all this out, writing like the

2202
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,359
hours of the day down. And you have this

2203
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,960
timetable, this routine as if it's like

2204
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,040
the best day possible. The big thing,

2205
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,319
the big mindset here is knowing that

2206
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,440
this is the best day possible. And

2207
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,159
you're probably not going to stick to it

2208
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:57,440
like 100%. And that's okay. If you stick

2209
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:59,199
to this timetable, even 30 to 40%,

2210
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,040
you'll actually be like living a way

2211
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,239
better life than you usually are anyway.

2212
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,520
Right? Most times when I when I'm

2213
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,199
helping a young guy and I tell them to

2214
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,480
write this timetable, they'll come to me

2215
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,880
and be like, "Oh, Hamza, I kind of

2216
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,560
messed up today. I was in school longer

2217
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,920
than I thought, so it kind of took away

2218
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,840
the time that I had for the thing

2219
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,199
afterwards and you know, I I the gym

2220
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,719
took me longer and I couldn't go

2221
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:18,080
whatever. The time table got messed up."

2222
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,440
And to that I always say, "Bro, the day

2223
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,400
you had today was still better than your

2224
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,679
normal day, wasn't it?" And he goes,

2225
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,360
"Yeah." And I says, "See, the time

2226
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,120
table's so powerful, you write down the

2227
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,719
perfect timetable, the perfect daily

2228
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,880
routine. And if you end up following it

2229
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,880
even 30 to 40%, it's usually better than

2230
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,239
your normal days anyway. But some days,

2231
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,199
because you've got the timetable in

2232
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,440
front of you, because you've already

2233
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:37,280
wrote 7 a.m. exercise, the decisions

2234
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,600
already been made, you end up having a

2235
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,760
way better day than your normal days.

2236
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,120
So, write down the timetable somewhere.

2237
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,040
So, this could be on your notes. You

2238
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,440
just write down 6:00 a.m. wake up and

2239
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,760
morning routine, 7:00 a.m. school, 3:00

2240
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,120
p.m. come home and eat, 400 p.m. gym,

2241
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,400
whatever. Just write it out somewhere,

2242
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,080
Google calendar, whatever. Just write

2243
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,320
down the daily time table you try and

2244
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,520
stick to as best as you can. slotting in

2245
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,199
all the things that we spoke about

2246
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,960
today. So, you might have some reminders

2247
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,480
for smiling. You might have a block of

2248
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,679
time for reading that book that I told

2249
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,120
you about. You'll have a block of time

2250
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,800
for going to the gym and lifting

2251
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,480
weights. You'll have a block of time for

2252
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,920
working on that purposeful mission that

2253
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,840
we spoke about. You'll have reminders

2254
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,000
for smiling. You'll have a block of time

2255
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,679
for learning how to be the the bad boy

2256
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,679
that girls want. You'll block all these

2257
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,520
times into your daily schedule. And once

2258
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,120
it's set, you just keep your schedule

2259
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,880
open as much as possible. You look at

2260
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,000
that on your phone instead of scrolling.

2261
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,360
So, you know how sometimes when you're

2262
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,880
on the bus or you're having a [ __ ] you

2263
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,199
just end up like scrolling? Instead of

2264
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,760
that, just keep the same page open on

2265
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:33,440
your phone, just stare at the timet. And

2266
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,280
what you'll do is you'll stick to it way

2267
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,120
better than your normal days. It'll be

2268
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,280
right there in your face. Okay, after

2269
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,199
this, I'm going to go and do that. After

2270
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,199
that, I'm going to go do that. And it's

2271
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,800
just so good for you to just remind

2272
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:46,960
yourself. You know, there's a reason why

2273
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,760
schools and the military have their

2274
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,520
people on timets because after a while,

2275
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,239
you start to kind of know what you're

2276
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,239
supposed to do after the current thing,

2277
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:58,080
right? It's about 9:00 a.m. right now as

2278
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,520
I record this, and my body is getting

2279
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,360
ready to go to the gym because I go

2280
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,679
always go to the gym about the same time

2281
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,400
every single day. So, it's almost like a

2282
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:08,320
habit, but for your entire day. Do you

2283
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,679
see how powerful that is? Those are the

2284
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,880
seven simple steps to curing depression.

2285
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,560
And I just want you to do a

2286
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,960
visualization right now, just like we

2287
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,239
did for Jeffrey.

2288
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,679
If you think about the life you're

2289
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,360
living right now where you felt

2290
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,679
depressed,

2291
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,880
you're living with your parents, you

2292
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:29,360
have no purposeful work, you have like a

2293
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,719
shitty social life, non-existent real

2294
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,920
dating life. You know, you're messaging

2295
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,920
a few girls, but it doesn't really

2296
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,920
count.

2297
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,600
That's the reason why you're depressed.

2298
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,159
Because your life is [ __ ] If I was you,

2299
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,239
I'd be depressed, too.

2300
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:47,120
Now, I just want you to visualize what I

2301
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:50,000
genuinely believe is the ultimate life

2302
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,800
for men. I promise you this is so true.

2303
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,640
It's where you move to a place where

2304
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,080
there's other people like you, where

2305
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:59,120
there's other people who are switched

2306
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,120
on, who are ambitious. Barley right now,

2307
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,040
as of me recording this, is such an

2308
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,640
amazing place to move to for young men.

2309
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,400
You make a few thousand dollars a month

2310
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,800
and then you can travel the world just

2311
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,040
working on your laptop. You know, I

2312
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,679
actually set this goal for myself back

2313
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,520
in 2019. I went on a holiday to Thailand

2314
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,520
with like an ex-girlfriend of mine. And

2315
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,640
this was when the phrase digital nomad,

2316
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,080
which basically means you make money

2317
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,760
online and you travel the world whilst

2318
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,840
working online. I traveled to Thailand

2319
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,520
and I was so hyped. Things were so cheap

2320
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,800
and you know, you got a motorbike and it

2321
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,719
was so much freedom and you're not in

2322
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,239
your hometown. No one knows you. So, you

2323
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,760
can be whoever you want to be. And when

2324
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,679
I came home from that holiday, I

2325
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,080
literally wrote down the goal. I wanted

2326
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,840
to make $2,000 a month online so that I

2327
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,199
could be a digital nomad and travel the

2328
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,960
world. And that's exactly what I

2329
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,360
achieved. So that's like the I tell you

2330
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,600
that is like the lifestyle. You make

2331
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,600
money online. You move to a place like

2332
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,120
Bali. You get your own place. You live

2333
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,719
by yourself. The best case scenario is

2334
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,159
that you connect with other guys who are

2335
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,679
on the same level as you right now.

2336
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,560
You're both trying to make money online.

2337
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,719
You're both, you know, on

2338
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,560
self-improvement, leveling up so that in

2339
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,760
a year from now, you can move to Bali

2340
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,360
together and you can literally share

2341
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,120
like a villa together. You've got that

2342
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,080
masculine vibe. And right now if you're

2343
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,080
thinking like, "Yeah, but I don't know

2344
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,360
anyone who'd even do that." That's

2345
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,120
remember I just mentioned that that

2346
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,280
course that you can join in, you know,

2347
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,719
my paid community. Not only do you get

2348
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,000
the courses as part of that program

2349
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,360
that's linked in the description, you

2350
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,199
get this community of guys who are

2351
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,480
serious about self-improvement. So so

2352
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,000
many of the guys there have connected

2353
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,920
with each other saying, "Oh yeah, like

2354
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,679
we're all working on this goal to be

2355
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,520
able to make a few,000 a month online

2356
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,960
and we can go live together and travel

2357
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
the world together." That's like the

2358
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,920
life for your men. You make money

2359
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,280
online. You can travel the world with

2360
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,199
your boys. You can hit the gym with

2361
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,560
them. You end up flirting with girls in

2362
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,920
all these different countries. You get a

2363
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,679
motorbike here. You fly over to this

2364
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,679
place. You get a villa here. You go to

2365
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,440
the gym. It's sunny. It's beautiful.

2366
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,280
There's good people here. You're you're

2367
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,719
far away from your family, your hometown

2368
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,040
so you can be who you want to be. You

2369
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,640
step into like this best version of you.

2370
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,080
You're training together. You're eating

2371
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,400
good food. It's almost like you're in

2372
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,640
this kind of like university kind of

2373
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,040
college kind of experience. But now

2374
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,480
outside of the education system with an

2375
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,840
online business, you're on

2376
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,199
self-improvement. You've developed

2377
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,719
yourself. There's attractive women

2378
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,239
everywhere. You're cold approaching.

2379
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,000
You're meeting new guys. You're training

2380
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,360
together. It's a [ __ ] beautiful life.

2381
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,760
I've been telling so many of my

2382
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,600
followers to set their sights on moving

2383
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,600
to exactly where I live, which is

2384
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,520
Barley. And a bunch of guys have a bunch

2385
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,199
of my followers have literally moved

2386
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,120
here and they all train in the same gym

2387
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,480
as me. So imagine like like bro, every

2388
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,159
day you go to the gym, there's other

2389
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,679
guys who have watched videos like this,

2390
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,800
who have quit the bad habits, who

2391
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,239
understand, you know, the addictions

2392
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,000
that we all went through, who are now

2393
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:29,840
eating clean, lifting weights together,

2394
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,199
being competitive, talking about the

2395
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,960
same things that we talk about. We've

2396
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,480
all got like inside jokes. We call each

2397
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,679
other Jeffrey, whatever. And it's like

2398
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,280
we've got like a [ __ ] little

2399
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,120
community here and every guy who's here

2400
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,800
has got massive smile on their face.

2401
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,480
It's so easy to meet women and meet

2402
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,320
other guys and you're making money on,

2403
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,560
bro. It's [ __ ] awesome. There's a

2404
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,000
whole world out here for you to explore.

2405
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,159
You don't need to just stay in your

2406
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,239
hometown and stay like, you know, this

2407
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:54,000
small little traumatized boy as you've

2408
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:55,920
been this entire time. There's a world

2409
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,600
out here for you to enjoy, right? To

2410
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,440
think about how beautiful it would be

2411
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,600
for you to like speak to a few guys

2412
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,280
right now who are on the same path as

2413
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,679
you who have got the same goal as you

2414
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,159
and for you guys to work together to to

2415
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,400
maybe get here later this year or next

2416
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:11,840
year at the same time. You rent a villa

2417
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,000
together. How [ __ ] cool would that

2418
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,440
be? That's why I made that community,

2419
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,199
Library of Adonis. That's where like the

2420
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,280
guys who are the most serious, the ones

2421
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,360
who like are my followers, the ones who

2422
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,040
are most serious about their growth, we

2423
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,960
join there as a community. And there's

2424
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,480
guys that you can meet who even who are

2425
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,719
inside of your hometown. Like you can

2426
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,800
see the map of our members and you can

2427
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:33,280
start to like actually get onto this

2428
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,040
path with other guys which checks off

2429
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,760
that need of your brotherhood, of your

2430
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,760
social life. There's a whole world out

2431
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,679
here. One where it's sunny and you're

2432
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,760
riding around on a [ __ ] motorbike

2433
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,360
shirtless. The type of stories that you

2434
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,920
will literally tell your future

2435
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,719
children. Life's too short to be just

2436
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,199
sat in your little childhood bedroom

2437
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,760
depressed, consuming.

2438
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:58,159
It all starts with you taking action on

2439
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,480
what I've given you here of you mixing

2440
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,480
with other men who are on this path who

2441
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,920
are going upwards in life. Not downwards

2442
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,800
like the Jeffre that you know, but

2443
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,480
upwards. You integrate really, really as

2444
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,239
best as you can in this like masculine

2445
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,159
self-improvement space that you are

2446
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:14,640
watching me for. And I promise you the

2447
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,480
life that you want, I promise you it's

2448
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,159
as good as I'm hyping it up to be. I

2449
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,840
promise you it's achievable. I've done

2450
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:22,640
it in a few years. I see a bunch of

2451
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,320
young guys as well, 18, 19, 20 years

2452
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,120
old, who have achieved it, and they they

2453
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,679
look so happy. They're so productive, in

2454
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,159
great shape, meeting girls and hyping up

2455
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:34,960
with the boys and and training hard and

2456
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:37,600
building businesses. There's such a good

2457
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,360
life out here. And I really I wish that

2458
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,199
for you cuz I've been in those days

2459
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,560
where I was depressed and I hated my

2460
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,880
life and I was just working some [ __ ]

2461
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,800
job that was like expected of me. I went

2462
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,239
to university, got the degree. I lived a

2463
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,560
life that was expected of me and I was

2464
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:54,320
so depressed and I changed up

2465
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,239
everything. And I'm so happy now. So

2466
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,560
happy. And I know that it is possible

2467
01:17:56,239 --> 01:18:00,159
for you to do the exact same thing. I

2468
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,760
want this transformation for you. I want

2469
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:04,000
more of our boys to start like, you

2470
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,280
know, living like the real life. Maybe

2471
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,719
moving out here. I know that's a big

2472
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,719
move to, you know, move up across the

2473
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,159
world to somewhere like Bali, but like

2474
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,760
that's something that you can set as a

2475
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:14,800
goal for the next like couple years when

2476
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:19,640
you can achieve it.

2477
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,640
I really hope that this helps you.

2478
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,960
Do the hard work, especially when you

2479
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,920
don't feel like it.

2480
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,920
Woo!
