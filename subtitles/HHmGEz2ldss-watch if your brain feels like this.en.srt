1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,759
if your brain feels like this then you

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,919
have brain rot you struggle to focus on

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,000
productive things but very easily slip

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,480
into bad habits I'm telling you this

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,160
right now you will lose years of your

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,639
youth if you don't fix this right now I

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,720
will give you an ancient technique that

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,039
I unlocked by reading old text and the

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,560
biographies of snipers there are more

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,359
than 150 guys who are doing this

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,400
technique daily and they are seeing some

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,880
really cool results so this will work

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,640
for you 100% of the time I have used

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,200
this technique as a an engineering

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,040
student to increase my focus to get

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,399
better grades I've used it to Do

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,040
genetics research as a biosciences PhD

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,200
student and I've even used this to be

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,760
more accurate with the M4 rifle as a

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,360
soldier in training at Ford Benning

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
Georgia this technique shows results

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,280
from day one and it is not like the

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,520
standard meditation techniques that

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,000
takes weeks to get into the best part is

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,239
it's kind of fun to do and it has a

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
clear way to track your progress I will

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,600
provide you all the resources you need

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm not going to be gatekeeping any of

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
my knowledge brain Rod happens when your

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,199
brain circuitry is compromised by

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,400
external over stimulation porn video

32
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,640
games and doom scrolling can do this

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,600
every time you do an action the neural

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
circuit Tre associated with that action

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,360
are strengthened so there's this vicious

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
cycle that keeps you trapped forever you

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,640
can literally observe your ability to

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,000
concentrate go down you can feel the

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,159
level of self-respect you have go down

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,600
you can even feel your intelligence and

41
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,439
creativity fall off a cliff but there is

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,840
a way out not only can you push through

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,759
all this [ __ ] you can actually

44
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,079
strengthen your brain in the process and

45
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,280
come out smarter and more more

46
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
intelligent more creative and more

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,079
resilient you can come out with better

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
control of your behavior and even the

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,840
manner of your speech you can emerge

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
from this with creativity and

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
productivity that you need to change

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
your life the human brain is the most

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
complex single entity in the known

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,640
universe and perhaps the most remarkable

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
thing about it is its ability to change

56
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,560
the most common advice given to guys who

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
are stuck is just go to the gym bro and

58
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,159
you know what that's actually really

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
good advice physical effort cuts to the

60
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,759
mental [ __ ] going to the gym and

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
seeing your body transformed shows you a

62
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,880
new way plus when you start going to the

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,640
gym you want to optimize your diet to

64
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,920
maintain your gains so you start eating

65
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,000
cleaner this further declutters your

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,959
brain however there's a weakness in this

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,760
method and I've seen this in myself and

68
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,959
clients and friends and the weakness is

69
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,640
that the ego built upon just physical

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,800
growth is fragile and a small setback

71
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,000
can send you back to your old Baseline

72
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,000
I've experienced this myself getting fit

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
does wonders for the mind but the

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
progress can be set back by even a small

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,200
failure one girl Rejects you and you

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,080
feel inadequate again not only that but

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
you start getting new anxieties what if

78
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,640
I'm not big enough and you'll start even

79
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,200
creating new copes I'll ask her out next

80
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,280
month when I'm bigger you never get big

81
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,480
enough to match your self-image this is

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,599
body dismorphia what you want is a

83
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,560
robust mind the kind of mind that does

84
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,760
not take damage from failure in the

85
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,120
ideal case we want an anti- fragile mind

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,840
that actually get stronger with failure

87
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,440
I don't think you can get there with the

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
gym alone another popular approach is

89
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,519
that of meditation meditation also works

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,400
the benefits are legit you get

91
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,120
measurable results you can feel your

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,680
mind becoming immune to setbacks you

93
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,799
start making better decisions as a

94
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,120
strategist and the most fun part is you

95
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,840
gain new social skills well technically

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,360
you don't gain social skills it's more

97
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,879
that you can actually apply the skills

98
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,200
that you already had because you're more

99
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,040
present but I mean you get the point

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
right but even meditation has a weakness

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,840
well the first weakness is that it takes

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,080
so long to get results you can go months

103
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,920
without feeling like you're making any

104
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,560
progress but the other is if you force

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,959
yourself to meditate you'll quickly

106
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,720
associate meditation with pain and soon

107
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,799
as life gets in the way you'll just quit

108
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,360
because you haven't got any you know

109
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,840
positive feedback from it we all know

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,280
that meditation works but how many

111
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,840
actually do this on a daily basis not

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
many and that's because it's a hard

113
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,200
habit to get into and an easy Habit to

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,640
fall out of I believe this is because

115
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,079
meditation Focus entirely on the mental

116
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,879
and I disagree with this approach one of

117
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,840
the key principles of esoteric health is

118
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,480
that the mind and the body are one it

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,480
follows that training one without the

120
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,720
other is flawed it is from this

121
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,200
realization that I started experimenting

122
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,000
I needed a technique that could see

123
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
results from day one so there's no

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,360
chance of quitting before I see results

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
I needed a technique that doesn't take

126
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,799
more than 10 minutes per day and will

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
give me a tangible power boost

128
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,919
throughout the day I got this technique

129
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
by studying military history and tactics

130
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
in almost every biography I read about

131
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,360
The Life and Adventures of elite modern

132
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,479
soldiers there's one commonality the

133
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,280
importance of controlling heart rate and

134
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,080
bread and this makes sense because the

135
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,560
modern Battlefield is not a place place

136
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
where you need to be the most physically

137
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,560
aggressive it's about Precision movement

138
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
and communication it requires clear

139
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
thinking and overall awareness think

140
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
about modern Weaponry even with a

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,680
standard issue M4 even with a simple Red

142
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Dot site you can reliably get rounds On

143
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Target from 300 M away and it's not

144
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
about how hard you squeeze the trigger

145
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,840
obviously it's about how stable you can

146
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,919
keep the Red Dot on the Target and this

147
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,840
requires breath control if you don't

148
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,440
have control over your body your own

149
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,560
physiology then you're going to miss

150
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,600
your Target because even a millimeter of

151
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,400
deviation of the Gun Barrel can cause

152
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,840
several meters of deviation at range the

153
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,440
second component is spatial awareness

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
you need to be aware of the peripheral

155
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,479
vision to be able to detect new targets

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,880
so the fundamentals of Modern Combat are

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,160
breath and spatial awareness so it

158
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
should be a zero surprise that the

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,280
military trained soldiers especially

160
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
snipers and operators on these aspects

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
this is the technique that I'm going to

162
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,720
share with you right now I'm going to

163
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
present to you the esoteric meditation

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,319
protocol I'm going to explain how it

165
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,520
works and provide you the exact guidance

166
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,319
you need to see results as you know one

167
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,520
of the core esoteric Health principles

168
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,319
is that the mind and body are one this

169
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,639
means the protocol must train both in

170
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,639
the same session so how does this work

171
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,240
we divide our 10-minute session into two

172
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,440
parts the first is the stress test and

173
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,919
the remaining 9 minutes are minutes of

174
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
spherical awareness the stress test is

175
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,199
to activate your sympathetic nervous

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
system your fight or flight response and

177
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,360
the spherical awareness part rapidly

178
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,560
cools you down into the parasympathetic

179
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,800
state which is your relaxed State this

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,720
process is similar to what a swordsmith

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,240
uses to temper his blade first the blade

182
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,440
is red hot but you immediately plunge it

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,319
into cold water this rapid cooling is

184
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,599
what actually strengthens the blade and

185
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,800
so it is with your mind so we heat up

186
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,000
the Mind using this stress test and then

187
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,759
we rapidly cool it down using spherical

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,120
awareness in order to strengthen the

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,080
mind let me explain in more detail so

190
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,759
what is this stress test it's is doing

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,800
the maximum amount of push-ups that you

192
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,599
can do in 1 minute why push-ups well

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,160
easily you can do push-ups basically

194
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,440
anywhere your room the airport School

195
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,120
literally anywhere you don't need any

196
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,720
kind of equipment to do it but here's

197
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,440
the catch it's not the specific number

198
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,840
of push-ups that you need to do it's

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
that you need to do as many push-ups as

200
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,479
you can in 60 seconds this means that

201
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,400
the difficulty scales with your level of

202
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,400
experience for a beginner maybe you can

203
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,879
only push out like 10 push-ups right but

204
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,680
those 10 push-ups would be challenging

205
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,879
if you're an expert maybe you can get 50

206
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,440
push-ups total but I guarantee you the

207
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,280
last 10 push-ups are still going to be

208
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,520
very painful and challenging so it's an

209
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,319
equalizer the last few reps are always

210
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,639
going to be a mental Challenge and

211
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,160
that's the point the the pain and the

212
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,560
honesty of hard physical work is just

213
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,800
what cleanses the mind and removes any

214
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,680
silly little depression or anxiety that

215
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,160
might be residing in your brain but

216
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
naturally this calisthenic workout is

217
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,879
going to give you a stressed state which

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
is the point your breathing will be

219
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,440
heavy your heart rate will be elevated

220
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,280
and that kind of state is not associated

221
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,599
with meditation at all traditional

222
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,280
meditation is all about the mind it's

223
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,319
all about relaxation and being calm

224
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,000
however the stress state is the kind of

225
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,919
condition you'd be expecting if you were

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,440
in combat a sniper would need to be able

227
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,960
to rapidly bring himself from the stress

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,440
State back into this parasympathetic

229
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,120
relaxed state in order to take the shot

230
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,720
and that's what we're going to be doing

231
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,879
the second phase of the esoteric

232
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,720
meditation protocol is spherical

233
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,919
awareness spherical awareness is a

234
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,360
technique that trains spatial

235
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,479
intelligence gymnasts and martial

236
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,960
artists use this technique to increase

237
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,840
their canes thesia which is um it's a

238
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,479
fancy word for the awareness of your

239
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,440
body in 3D space very cool technique

240
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,840
especially for self-defense with or

241
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,479
without weapons also very beneficial in

242
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
Social environments because allows you

243
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,759
to read micro Expressions at a

244
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
subconscious level and get the feel of

245
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,599
the room if you know what that means the

246
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,560
spherical meditation part is difficult

247
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
to explain with words it's a more

248
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,680
experienced thing it's like it's like

249
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
trying to explain how to ride a bike by

250
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,680
just talking about it it's not feasible

251
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,479
there's a part of it which you kind have

252
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,599
to do in order to experience in order to

253
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,519
learn so I will upload another video

254
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,000
which is a full guided meditation on how

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
to do spherical awareness so after you

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
finish this video go to that and

257
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,480
practice it for yourself to see the

258
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,600
benefits the esoteric meditation

259
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
protocol gives you results from day one

260
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,440
but the results only compound and you

261
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,680
can see a step change in the benefits

262
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,399
after the first week for this reason

263
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,959
I've created this 30-day challenge in

264
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,760
order to keep you consistent a

265
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,959
day-by-day training that will guide you

266
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,480
at every step I will do the push-ups

267
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,399
with you I'll will guide you through the

268
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,200
spherical awareness process I've built

269
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,760
out this course to deliver a new module

270
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
every day so you can maintain your

271
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,120
consistency it's like a video game that

272
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
unlocks new levels as you finish the

273
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
previous one it will be as though I'm

274
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
with you training and meditating it's a

275
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,680
challenge to do any good habit for 30

276
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,839
days but having a new module drop every

277
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
single day gives you a sense of

278
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,320
progression you can see in this

279
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,480
community that people are sharing photos

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
of their progress tracker there's even a

281
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,200
7-Day Hall of Fame for those who have

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
been consistent for 7 Days the last time

283
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,160
I showed this off there was only 60 guys

284
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
in here now there's more than double

285
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,720
many new members have started to engage

286
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
in this weird but simple meditation

287
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,399
protocol right now it's practically free

288
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,720
