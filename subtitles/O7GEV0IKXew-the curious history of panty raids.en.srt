1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,460
run to the girls dorm almost naked and

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,379
they would start singing songs serenades

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,120
some of the girls would play along take

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,559
off their pennies swing it around their

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,519
fingers and then toss it across the

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
courtyard

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,039
life has gotten objectively more boring

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,900
since we all started carrying around a

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
high resolution camera in the form of

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,039
our iPhone in our pocket every day about

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,840
a week ago a friend invited me over for

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,820
lunch and he had his family there his

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,380
father was there his father is about 60

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,000
years old that he attended the same

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,740
University that I did he was telling me

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
about his experiences in my University

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,280
some of the things that you said just

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,140
blew my mind like things that he

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
mentioned could never happen in today's

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,280
climate I fact checked all of these so I

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,260
went back and looked at Old School

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,300
newspaper records he wasn't making it up

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,160
so there used to be this culture in my

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,140
University a group of guys maybe like 15

25
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,940
guys they were all stripped down to

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,219
their underpants they'll run to the

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,719
girls dorms with a courtyard in the

28
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,699
middle so these guys would go into the

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,579
courtyard almost naked and they would

30
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,260
start singing songs doing serenades just

31
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,780
making a whole Ruckus and being being

32
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,519
annoying being funny doing stupid things

33
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,439
to impress these girls and they would

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,000
ask them for their panties now obviously

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,740
like some of the girls would just hate

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,360
this whole thing and stay indoors but

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,880
some of the girls were would play along

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,619
they would walk onto the balcony do a

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
dance do like the whole show and

40
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,220
everything make it interesting and take

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,659
off their pennies swing it around their

42
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,340
fingers and then toss it across the

43
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,020
courtyard and these things would just

44
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,759
like you know fly and then float down

45
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,619
like parachutes and the guys would go

46
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,420
wild like they would jump and try to

47
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,159
catch these that would be their trophy

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,540
and people would fight over these and

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
you know they'll get bloody nose and

50
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,500
everything so can you imagine something

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,820
like that even remotely like that

52
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,220
happening in today's University

53
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,720
environment impossible it would be

54
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,659
Crackdown like they people would call

55
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,360
the cops on these guys guaranteed but

56
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,860
even leaving aside the administration

57
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,540
side of things you know even the

58
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,299
University Administration coming in

59
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,000
people would still not do crazy things

60
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,439
like this nowadays simply because if it

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,939
was done somebody would have their phone

62
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,100
on them everything which happens would

63
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,200
be online the next day or the same day

64
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,380
like on Tick Tock or something and this

65
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,280
causes us to not have these crazy

66
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,259
experiences and looking at these crazy

67
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,420
things happen because no one is gonna do

68
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,060
him and instead if crazy things are done

69
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,580
they're done solely for the purpose of

70
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,980
tick tock slash social media so if

71
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,480
something fun and crazy like this was to

72
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,400
happen it would be done with an

73
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,500
intention in mind not just the fun but

74
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,120
the clout on social media and that just

75
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,860
changes things somehow and and other

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
experiences with this father of my

77
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,220
friend was talking about they used to do

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,720
this thing called The Naked Mile and I

79
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,180
know you've probably seen that stupid

80
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,400
absolutely stupid movie well it was kind

81
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
of fun though American Pie Naked Mile I

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
think it's like a decade ago this movie

83
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,379
came out yeah but that's a real thing

84
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,120
like people used to actually do that so

85
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,739
in the coldest winter night in my

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,140
University these guys they would strip

87
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,360
down to barely nothing they would run

88
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,819
across campus on this well-known path

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,860
butt naked and then they would go back

90
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,260
to their dorm so at this time there was

91
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,879
this all-male dorm in my University also

92
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,860
had this Courtyard in the center so they

93
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,379
would do something called the authentic

94
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,000
Olympics and it is as bizarre as it

95
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,500
sounds get this right these guys would

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,060
strip down to nothing I don't know why

97
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,620
nudity was a part of all these stories

98
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,540
but anyway they've still done basically

99
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,180
nothing and they were do the entire

100
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,640
Olympic Games in the privacy of their

101
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,040
all-male Dawn they'd have like discus

102
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,900
throw long jump running and printing all

103
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,159
those Olympic events they would just

104
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,560
have fun you know they have a whole

105
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,900
sports day and I see nothing like that

106
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,220
in the modern University system and let

107
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,680
me be very specific I'm not talking

108
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,480
about the nudity and the craziness of

109
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
this I'm talking more about the sense of

110
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,379
community that existed among these guys

111
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,940
which doesn't exist now well first thing

112
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,440
if anybody tried to do this obviously

113
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,900
there'll be you know videoed and put

114
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,480
online but besides that I have never in

115
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,940
my many years in University seen a whole

116
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,159
dorm come together to do anything unless

117
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,440
it's University mandated most of the

118
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,420
time guys don't even know other guys on

119
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
their same floor they'll only know their

120
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,780
roommate because they have to and

121
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,780
there's no sense of fraternity and

122
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,760
co-mingling friendships forming across a

123
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,860
group of 100 guys I've never seen that

124
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,959
the maximum friend circle of guys I've

125
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,700
seen is like three four fraternities are

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,980
different of course the fraternities are

127
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,480
essentially 100 dies hopefully you know

128
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,680
living together and well that's a

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,760
different most people most guys don't

130
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,220
join fraternities and another

131
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,320
interesting story was the fights

132
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,000
apparently back in the day the Freshman

133
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,100
Class sophomore class would literally

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,840
fight like the whole class of course the

135
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,280
University was a smaller place back then

136
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,540
but it must have been at least a couple

137
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,699
hundred guys maybe like 200 guys

138
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,259
everybody would meet at this water tower

139
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,360
that we have they would just go at it

140
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,340
like complete brawling like whole mosh

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,600
biting it out and the reason was so

142
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
usually the sophomores would kind of

143
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,500
pick on the freshmen but if they could

144
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,880
win the respect of their Elders then the

145
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,199
bullying would stop and that's why they

146
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,120
would do these fights it's also another

147
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,440
reason to weed out the week if you

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,880
didn't show up for the fight for your

149
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,380
class you know represent your class and

150
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,540
fight for your class then you would

151
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,280
immediately be singled out as the guy

152
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,139
who didn't show up for the fight and

153
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,479
then you would be bullied by your own

154
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,220
class now this all seems very crass it

155
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,380
almost seems as though it's a good thing

156
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,840
we left these things behind I strongly

157
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,360
disagree fighting especially as a part

158
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,979
of a tribal unit like your class a

159
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,320
university class even there's something

160
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,180
important that we've lost when all these

161
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
Traditions fell away we know with the

162
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Advent of more administrative pressure

163
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,040
and also the Advent of the smartphone

164
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,780
it's hard to put my finger on it but I

165
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,699
think you feel the Nostalgia that I do

166
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,440
it would be fun wouldn't it to just go

167
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,180
with all your boys and fight this other

168
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,680
huge group of guys and then maybe you

169
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,539
come back to your dorms kind of bruised

170
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,220
but proud that you did what you did I

171
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,720
missed that even though I haven't

172
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,520
experienced that in college strange

173
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
strange feeling but now the question

174
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,639
becomes Well you aren't going to get rid

175
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,960
of smartphones anytime soon like

176
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,699
smartphones are not going anywhere so

177
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
what do you do you are never going to

178
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,320
see a panty raid you're likely never

179
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,960
going to see a whole on war between

180
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,280
classes you're never going to see you

181
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,259
know any of these things which our

182
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,360
father's generation got to see however

183
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,580
we can still reclaim some of that

184
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,919
spontaneity spontaneity how do you say

185
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,380
the word and love for life that these
