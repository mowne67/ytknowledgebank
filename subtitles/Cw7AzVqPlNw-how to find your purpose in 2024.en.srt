1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,640
me quite a few times why I join the Army

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,480
if I'm so against big government well

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,320
easy answer to that is have you heard

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,559
this phrase when a girl

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,039
says um you know when a girl's in Rock

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,960
Bottom she'll say f it I'll be a hooker

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,840
when a guy hits Rock Bottom he says f it

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,439
I'll join the Army it's an old joke but

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,640
it's true so what happened was I had

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,439
just finished well I was in the PHD

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,599
program and I

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,320
had found out that the PhD wasn't for me

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,320
and this was very disappointing to my

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,760
parents I disappointed my parents twice

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,360
in a row so what happened was I was

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
during my PhD program I realized that

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,320
what I was doing it for was for that

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,160
steady paycheck and for the status that

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,600
it conveyed if you were a university

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,039
Professor you would have status you

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,920
would have a steady paycheck I would

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,480
have made my parents proud if you know

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,680
anything about Asian parenting it's a

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
lot of comparison like oh your kid did

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
this you know my kid actually did this

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,359
my kid Works in Microsoft my kid Works

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
in Amazon and when I told my parents

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,720
like I didn't want to be a professor I

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,799
didn't want to do a science job that was

30
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,280
a second blow to them the first time I

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,280
was like I don't want to be an engineer

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,920
second time I was like I don't even want

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,360
to be a scientist and I dropped out of

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
the PHD

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
program and what I found was I didn't

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,439
know what to do I was looking for

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,880
Brotherhood I was looking for meaning I

38
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,479
was looking for purpose I wanted to

39
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,640
belong to something greater I wanted to

40
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,360
have a greater

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,720
purpose and

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,720
I looked at the options that I had I was

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,040
like you know soldiers get a lot of

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,520
respect they're not the highest paid but

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,479
they get a lot of

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,360
respect they get a lot of status and I

47
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,520
always love the idea of surgery because

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm very much into military history I

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,600
like you know I could do this I'm

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,799
physically strong enough to be a soldier

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,079
I can surely track the code and I signed

52
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,360
up I enlisted and you know what it

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
actually worked it's the thing for the

54
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,000
first three months of training I loved

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,640
it I genuinely enjoyed basic training

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,560
which is a weird thing to say for

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,000
anybody who has been through that I

58
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,399
genuinely enjoyed the first three months

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,800
CU I actually had status I had status

60
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,760
because I was one of the older guys in

61
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,560
my platoon and a platoon is 50 soldiers

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,120
more or less I had status in my platoon

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,239
and I had status because I was a little

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,959
bit older I had more you know Real World

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,000
experience as it was and I kind of knew

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
what was going on and I was like a solid

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,239
you know four years older so of course I

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,120
had a bit of respect right even the

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,480
drills like the drill sergeant even they

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,440
treated me a little bit differently than

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,599
the average 17y old 18yar old who was

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,040
trying to

73
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,159
enlist and I let it get into my head I

74
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,200
wanted to be a leader and I was I was

75
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,239
actually good at that job I was able to

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,760
control and command and lead from the

77
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,680
front and I remember this with extreme

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
detail there was a obstacle course so of

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
course there was an obstacle course

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,959
right so they divided the platoon into

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,519
two halves and the side of them who got

82
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,400
me they rejoiced and the side who didn't

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,799
get me they were in despair because I

84
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,879
was seen as an asset literally the guys

85
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,920
wanted my presence there not because I

86
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,360
was the fastest or strongest or biggest

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,040
or the meanest but because they knew

88
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,760
that I could lead them to Victory and I

89
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,720
did I loved it man I had status I had

90
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,959
respect of my peers and it was going

91
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,200
great and I wanted the PG position so PG

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
is Platoon guide it's just a fake

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
position to be honest it's basically

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,480
you're the leader of the platoon for the

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,840
duration of training and the drill

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,519
sergeant appointed me as a PG about 3

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,519
months in that's exactly what I wanted I

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
made the wow to make my platoon the best

99
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,760
performing platoon in the entire company

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,239
company is for platoon

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,760
usually and on the same day that I got

102
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,480
appointed PG Platoon guide I was fired

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,920
from the job for the stupidest reason I

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
I don't remember what it was I think

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,519
like my flag patch was like slightly

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,079
crooked or something stupid like that

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
and I was fired from the position that I

108
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,599
had worked so hard to get and I had so

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,599
many Big Dreams

110
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:23,080
for I resented that genuinely I resented

111
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,800
that I I hated the arbitrariness of the

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,160
army so much and you know that wore off

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
after a couple days but I had to look at

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
the Army's training protocol in more

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,039
detail and I realized it was a terrible

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,080
protocol the Army does not want Warriors

117
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,680
doesn't want to train Knights doesn't

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,800
want to train leaders because if you

119
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,759
wanted that kind of system what you

120
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,680
would do is You' have a caraan stick

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
type system right you would incentivize

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
good behavior and you would punish bad

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,000
behavior that's not what happens in Army

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,840
basic training what happens is arbitrary

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,520
punishment you do the right thing get

126
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,919
punished you do the wrong thing you get

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,600
punished you don't do anything anything

128
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,880
you get punished you try to put your

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,479
best foot forward you get punished there

130
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,240
is no Rhyme or Reason it's just the

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,400
whims of the drill sergeant who's in

132
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,280
charge on that day and I realized this

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,000
is not a mistake this is by Design This

134
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,319
is not a bug in the system this is the

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,720
feature because the US doesn't want

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,080
Warriors they want peasant soldiers they

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,919
want mindless ctors who would just do

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,160
their bidding and fight Banker Wars and

139
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,880
bleed for the Saudis they don't want the

140
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
soldiers to think for thems they don't

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,319
want to have incentives for

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,479
self-improvement they just

143
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,319
want punishment given arbitrarily to

144
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,120
break the Mind down such that it's just

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,440
Mindless obedience that's what they

146
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,680
really want and I realized this I was

147
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,680
like God damn it I signed a contract now

148
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,240
I'm stuck in

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,039
this and you know I had joined the army

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,600
for many good many good reasons but I

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,479
had joined the it also for the sense of

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Duty Brotherhood you know

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,520
masculinity and truly a bit of status

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,440
and I didn't have any of those

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,880
things I like did I just make the worst

156
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:19,520
mistake of my life but it wasn't all bad

157
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,919
wasn't all bad it's because of

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
this had these little notebooks not

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,240
exactly this one but it looked kind of

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,759
like that it's these waterproof

161
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,199
notebooks called right in the rain

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,639
notebooks anybody in the military knows

163
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,759
exactly what I'm talking about these are

164
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,160
notebooks which are waterproof so you

165
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,319
can write in them even if it's like

166
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,840
pouring outside so these little

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,520
notebooks I carried them everywhere I

168
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,039
went and if you know anything about the

169
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,039
military there's this concept called

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,599
hurry up and wait the idea is man it's

171
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,280
annoying as hell the idea is there's

172
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:52,080
periods of intense activity where it's

173
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,639
go go go there's periods of absolute

174
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,759
boredom where they're given no commands

175
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
and you don't know what to do you're

176
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,199
just sitting there most people wasted

177
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,879
that time but not me I use that time I

178
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,400
was journaling I was writing I didn't

179
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,039
know how to journal at the time it's a

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,840
skill that you can Master but I didn't

181
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:12,039
do that right but I had time on my side

182
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,599
I had 8 months of absolute monk mode on

183
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,960
my side nobody has this luxury but I had

184
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,360
this luxury I had eight months of my

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,759
life where I had zero internet zero

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,120
Instagram Zero YouTube zero Tik Tok zero

187
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,919
anything I didn't have the news I didn't

188
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,879
have the phone call to call anybody

189
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,039
including my parents I didn't have any

190
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,520
kind of internet and

191
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,400
complete isolation right only thing I

192
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,720
was allowed to have was one religious

193
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,120
text I chose the bhagwad Gita to take

194
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
with me which is an ancient religious

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,840
text and of course other guys had Bibles

196
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,720
I borrowed their Bible there are some

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,080
guys with Quran I borrowed the Quran as

198
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,560
well and what I learned was you must

199
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,080
find your duty and do that Duty and

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Destiny takes care of itself and it's

201
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,919
written in different ways but all the

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,599
religious text have this message I was

203
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,479
like okay fine that's well and good but

204
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,000
how do you find your duty how do you you

205
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:07,039
find your purpose and that brings us to

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,080
the topic of today the LSD method which

207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,840
I shall instruct to you which is the

208
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,199
literal method which I used while in

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,520
training to figure out my purpose and

210
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,639
really when I came back out of training

211
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,680
that was my comeback you know till then

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,000
I was I was stalled I did my engineering

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,479
degree didn't go anywhere I didn't want

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,759
to be an engineer started my bio Master

215
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,639
bio PhD actually and that didn't go

216
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
anywhere got a masters and you can't do

217
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,839
really anything with the biom Masters

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,159
biop PhD is prestigious right but biom

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
Masters like you can be a community

220
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,159
college

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,560
professor what is that pay no

222
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,519
status who wants that right what my

223
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,600
thing so until that point it was just a

224
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,240
bunch of false starts and stops and

225
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,720
failures I'll call them that I'll call

226
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,080
them failures but not after that you

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,080
know after I got done with training it

228
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,160
was different life and I'm going to show

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,760
you this exact method find your purpose

230
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,360
find your duty after that you cannot

231
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
fail because even if you're failing at

232
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,480
your duty but you're making the attempt

233
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,800
that's still a success it's only a

234
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,800
failure when you're doing the wrong

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
thing even if you do the wrong thing

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,839
well it's still the wrong thing so what

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,200
happened exactly in my story so I was in

238
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,360
basic training I was you know

239
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,200
disappointed in my ability to be a

240
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,680
leader I was kicked out of that position

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,200
and I had to be sat there contemplating

242
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,079
what to do how to improve because I knew

243
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,079
that if if I at the end of basic

244
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,040
training I didn't have a vision for

245
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,640
myself then I would be in the same exact

246
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,320
position as before I joined no vision no

247
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,600
Direction

248
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,560
nothing so I started journaling with a

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,320
specific intent of making my vision my

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,680
dream future that's how I came up with

251
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,600
that 9f framework so you might have seen

252
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,600
that video the 9f framework is the best

253
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,399
Vision framework to create a high

254
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,000
definition image of what you want the

255
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
future to look like such that you

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,240
actually achieve it so if you haven't

257
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,720
watched that video it's a requirement go

258
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,800
and check out the 9f framework video

259
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,440
it's

260
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,079
entitled I don't know I'll put in the

261
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,120
description right so it's basically a

262
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,800
video which Paints the picture of what

263
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,279
you want your life to look like and

264
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
after doing that framework I was like

265
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,399
you know Army is never going to get me

266
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,000
there it's not Army is not about freedom

267
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,560
and time Freedom Travel Freedom it's not

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,519
about abundance of money it's about

269
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,279
obedience and that wasn't

270
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,959
me so I realized my path was going to be

271
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,800
different I had to do something

272
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,640
different I wanted to

273
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,519
create something create products sell

274
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,720
useful products and make a difference in

275
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,639
people's lives I realized this but I

276
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,800
didn't really know how to do it but

277
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,680
that's the good thing about this method

278
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,440
is you don't have to be perfect in

279
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,200
finding your duty and your purpose you

280
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,120
could be kind of right and you can

281
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,240
course correct to eventually find that

282
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,320
thing which is correct perfect for you

283
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,839
so once I got done with basic training I

284
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,560
created my first business it's not this

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
business and I'll talk about that later

286
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll give you first the actionable STP

287
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,920
the straight up exact actionable steps

288
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,279
and the protocol which is the

289
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,440
LSD method so this is a 3-we framework

290
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:14,320
all right L is week one s week 2 and D

291
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,880
is week three L stands for listen so who

292
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,440
are you listening to you are

293
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,279
listening for divine inspiration you are

294
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,880
listening for divine inspiration but the

295
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,240
problem is your mind is blocked your

296
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,839
mind is blocked by conditioning and

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,200
there are three kinds of conditioning

298
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
the first is Parental conditioning I've

299
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,399
talked about this a little bit before my

300
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,800
parents vision for me was to be an

301
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,440
engineer their Vision was so powerful

302
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,160
and so real in their hearts and Minds

303
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,760
that I absorbed it I didn't even think

304
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
twice I didn't have

305
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,720
to but it wasn't the vision for me it

306
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
wasn't the vision for me so at some

307
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,639
point I had to have that difficult

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,880
conversation be like hey Mom I don't

309
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,680
want to do this this is not my thing Hey

310
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,680
Dad I can't I don't want to this is not

311
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,480
my destiny and I want you to have this

312
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,440
difficult conversation especially if you

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,519
are from any kind of Asian household you

314
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,720
probably have a strong bit of Parental

315
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,680
conditioning I want you to have the

316
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
difficult conversation before you have

317
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,440
to have it right at some point you're

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,760
going to break and you're going to be

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,440
like I need to have the conversation

320
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,519
right now don't wait for that go and

321
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,360
have that conversation as soon as you

322
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,600
can to chart your path for the future

323
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,320
tell them that their vision for you is

324
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
not your vision for you and that you

325
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,920
have to go your own way the second kind

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,959
of conditioning is social conditioning

327
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
and what's going on here

328
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,000
is depending on your race or gender

329
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,920
there are expectations placed on you if

330
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,519
you are brown expect you to work in like

331
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,839
Microsoft or Amazon Google or if you're

332
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,880
lower income gas station right gas

333
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
station is the

334
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,199
common

335
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,279
stereotype or they have other

336
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,079
expectation if you are white they'll say

337
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,120
you're privileged anything you achieve

338
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,160
is because of systemic injustices on

339
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,519
other races you're privileged if you're

340
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,959
black they'll say oh you poor oppressed

341
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
Soul we have to coddle you and and we

342
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,440
have to give you all this free stuff

343
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,800
that's the only way you're going to

344
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,839
succeed there's no opportunity for you

345
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,279
if you're women they'll say Hey you have

346
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,560
to be a girl boss you know you have to

347
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,440
make six figures if you want to be a mom

348
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,120
you're being oppressed you're being

349
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,519
brainwashed by your husband imagine

350
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,440
you're a woman all right you're a girl

351
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,720
and in your heart you want to have kids

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,399
you want to be a

353
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,160
wife if you try to do that you'll be

354
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,480
ridiculed for that and I have a lot of

355
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,320
compassion for women in our society

356
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,680
all these stupid stupid podcasts try to

357
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,160
antagonize men versus women women are

358
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,199
 and men are this and that's not

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,120
true most women have a duty and a

360
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,320
purpose just like you and I but they're

361
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,279
even more brainwashed even more

362
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
societally conditioned than we are it's

363
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,680
actually harder for them to find their

364
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,320
purpose than it is for us so I have a

365
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,600
deep well of empathy for all women

366
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
either in my life or just strangers I

367
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,720
encourage you to see it from their point

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
of view as well

369
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,079
at least for us as men you know money

370
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,040
status property that's what Society

371
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,480
wants us to get and that's kind of what

372
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,519
we want anyway so at least there's

373
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,519
some Parallels for women it's the

374
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,839
opposite what they truly want and what

375
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,480
Society wants them to want are going in

376
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,480
opposite directions it's worse for them

377
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,279
than it is for us that's two kinds of

378
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,800
conditioning there's another one but

379
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,959
before that I want to talk about how you

380
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,839
can destroy this conditioning and this

381
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,920
is the part of the contemplative walk so

382
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,920
gentlemen of older times they had this

383
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,160
habit of going on leisurely strolls in

384
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,160
the park all right it wasn't for cardio

385
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
wasn't for exercise wasn't for Fitness

386
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,639
it was for the mind it was

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,199
cognition I want you to be outside if

388
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,880
possible if it's too cold then I

389
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,279
understand you can walk inside indoors

390
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,600
instead you can pace around your room

391
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,079
you can pace around your hall when you

392
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,720
are walking especially in nature when

393
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,600
you don't have an agenda in mind you you

394
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,920
don't have your phone on you you just

395
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,160
have a notebook and a pencil you are

396
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,440
going to be receptive to divine

397
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,600
inspiration also you're going to be

398
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,959
receptive to the conditioning the

399
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,160
aspects of your conditioning are going

400
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,000
to pop out at you and that's when you

401
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,199
can confront them and you can trace them

402
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,199
back to how you got that thought or that

403
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,000
conditioning and when you trace it back

404
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,600
that's how you destroy it if you have a

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,800
limiting belief of you know I'm ugly I

406
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,480
can't get GRS all right you have that

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,480
belief creat it back so like oh that one

408
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,639
girl in like sixth grade she said

409
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,839
something funny about my face and that's

410
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,600
the reason I have this insecurity

411
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,639
destroyed right contemplative walks is

412
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,720
for contemplation you are going about

413
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,600
your stroll without an agenda in mind

414
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,680
specifically so that when thoughts come

415
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,040
up you are able to address them as a

416
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,160
mature

417
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,800
adult the Third Kind of conditioning is

418
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,000
chemical conditioning and you are not

419
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,040
going to be able to solve this with

420
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,360
contemplative walks chemical

421
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,399
conditioning is the effect of parasites

422
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,959
emfs of course estrogenics on the human

423
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,480
nervous system you know there's a study

424
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,319
which shows

425
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,920
that as testosterone levels increase in

426
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:22,720
men their political beliefs change how

427
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,120
bizarre is that why should

428
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,000
political inclinations have anything to

429
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,480
do with a hormone in the body what's

430
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,120
going on over there is the way your

431
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
hormones interact with your brain

432
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,000
determines your Big Five personality

433
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,680
traits and your Big Five personality

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,880
traits have a huge impact on what your

435
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,639
self-perception is and that has a huge

436
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,720
impact on what your political leaning is

437
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
but also just in general what you think

438
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,440
you're going to be successful at so now

439
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,079
that's a big topic onto itself like how

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,959
do you avoid estrogenics and everything

441
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,920
so I will keep that topic aside for a

442
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,000
later

443
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,519
lecture but just make sure you're

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,880
cognizant of that aspect

445
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,600
once you do that that's the week one

446
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,760
that's the homework for week one

447
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,679
basically and then you go onto week two

448
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,720
which is search so when you're in the

449
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
search phase which is week two you are

450
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,520
going to actively be Plumbing the depths

451
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,880
of your mind to find out your core

452
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,039
memories I want you to ask the question

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,400
when you are left unsupervised as a kid

454
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,799
what is it that you spent your time on

455
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,120
for me answer is easy reading I loved

456
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,520
reading then I loved stories I loved

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,640
learning new words I enjoyed the art of

458
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,120
reading I read anything Science History

459
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I I wouldn't even understand it half the

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
time right I was a kid but I would read

461
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,840
it for the pleasure of reading and

462
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,520
different kids have different

463
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,640
inclinations some love to draw some love

464
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,600
music some like to run around for no

465
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,880
godamn reason they just like to run the

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,039
reason I bring that up is because I'm

467
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,240
going to share with you the five types

468
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,840
six types of intelligence and you're

469
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,760
going to be able to relate your core

470
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,360
memories as a child with what kind of

471
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,600
intelligence you have and that's going

472
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,000
to give you a hint as to what your duty

473
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,039
might be the five kinds of intelligence

474
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,600
first one is linguistic or word-based

475
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,520
intelligence that's me I have a

476
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,000
word-based intelligence I am good with

477
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,240
words either speaking them or writing

478
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,159
them reading them that's my thing and a

479
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,320
example of a Duty for people with a

480
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:26,280
linguistic intelligence would be

481
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,520
something like I want to write

482
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,480
life-changing essays which improve

483
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,440
people's Soul an example of somebody in

484
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,480
the public domain who has a linguistic

485
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,720
based intelligence is Jordan Peterson

486
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,520
very good with

487
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,520
words another type of intelligence is

488
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,240
logical and mathematical

489
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,480
reasoning this I have it to some extent

490
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,960
but it's not really my main form of

491
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,320
intelligence so logical and mathematical

492
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,520
reasoning an example of a Duty for this

493
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,520
kind of person would be I want to solve

494
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
challenging mathematical problems to

495
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,799
improve the advanced ment of science and

496
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,240
technology that could be a possible Duty

497
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,640
for that kind of person example of

498
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,640
somebody in the public space doing

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,080
this Ben Shapiro to be honest I don't

500
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,280
like him I don't like his message I

501
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,440
think he's regardless he is good at

502
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,159
logic though he's very good at taking an

503
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,679
argument breaking down into competent

504
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,360
parts and disproving them that's his

505
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,360
whole thing so that's an example

506
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,480
of logical or mathematical reasoning

507
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,480
another type of intelligence is musical

508
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,480
and for example we have people whose

509
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,640
duty is

510
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,360
to improve the human soul or Elevate the

511
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,760
human soul using Music These are people

512
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,880
who get Melody tune Harmony this is not

513
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,919
me at all like I'm not that skilled at

514
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,600
music can't keep a beat for to save my

515
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,080
life right it's not my thing but it

516
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,080
might be for you another type of

517
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,080
intelligence

518
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,640
is spatial Visual and

519
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,039
spatial visual spatial intelligence is

520
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,120
basically when you can take a 3D object

521
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,280
and you can manipulate it in 3D space an

522
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,200
application of this is like fighter

523
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
pilots when a fighter pilot is flying

524
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,720
his plane he needs to have a

525
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,799
threedimensional

526
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,520
understanding of of the space otherwise

527
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,039
going to get killed that is one example

528
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,280
Joo willing has extreme spatial

529
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,240
intelligence he was a a Navy SEAL

530
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,919
operator right so you need to know you

531
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,280
know where your fire team is in real

532
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:37,400
time in 3D space that's visual

533
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,799
intelligence so find out which kind of

534
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,640
intelligence you have and that's going

535
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,600
to give you a hint as to what kind of

536
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Duty you might be given because

537
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,679
everybody has a different type of

538
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,720
intelligence and they're uniquely suited

539
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,080
to doing one job better than everybody

540
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,240
else to find that it helpful to know

541
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,960
what kind of intelligence you do have

542
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,480
all right so that's your search phase

543
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,200
once you've destroyed your conditioning

544
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,520
you're going to go and search for your

545
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,720
duty your meaning in life and that's

546
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,640
your week two main task once you are

547
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,480
done with that you're going to go on to

548
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
week three and of course I forgot to

549
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,000
mention one of the most important types

550
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,880
of intelligence is social intelligence

551
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,760
and a great example of this is

552
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,080
Hamza so an example of a purpose you can

553
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,640
have if you have social intelligence

554
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:28,320
is I want to end men's addictions with

555
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,799
pornography by having empathy and

556
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,720
understanding of their condition Hamza

557
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,240
has this and even though it may not seem

558
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,960
like the most monetizable form of

559
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,480
intelligence you know clearly it hasn't

560
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,200
stopped him so any kind of intelligence

561
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,760
that you have can lead to amazing

562
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,600
results so long as you give it the

563
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,000
chance and you actually apply yourself

564
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,919
to your duty apply yourself to your duty

565
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,679
and Destiny takes care of itself then we

566
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,600
move on to the third week which is do so

567
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,320
you found what potential purpose you

568
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,360
could have you have to actually execute

569
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,039

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,120

579
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,120
all right so don't be stressed allow

580
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,039
inspiration to find you where when

581
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,720
you're in the DU phase you are actually

582
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,919
taking action if you chosen

583
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,760
entrepreneurship of any kind to be your

584
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,400
vocation that's what you want to do cool

585
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
if you have chosen entrepreneurship

586
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,360
solve a problem that you have in real

587
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,000
life could be something dumb the first

588
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,880
business I started was a robe business

589
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,760
you know how like Hamza wears bath robes

590
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,159
right so this was before

591
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,919
Hamza my first business so the problem

592
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,760
which I was having was I would I would

593
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,799
like wearing robes in Winter I thought

594
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
there really cozy really comfortable

595
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,000
enjoyed them

596
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,919
right but when you try to go and do

597
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,080
dishes or something the sleeves always

598
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,279
get wet and if you're too warm you can't

599
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,080
really roll up the sleeves of your robe

600
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,120
because they'll just flop down so I was

601
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,200
like you know what if I had a robe which

602
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,360
I had a a loop and a button I just pull

603
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,039
the sleeve up and then Loop and button

604
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
it in place so that it stays up and you

605
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,000
have a sleeveless

606
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,559
robe not a great Innovation right but I

607
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,520
was like you know I really want this

608
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,400
product and I made the product it was

609
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,440
kind of a product cuz I just got it

610
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
you know cheaply made in China it was

611
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,200
completely 100% polyester so I didn't

612
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,799
even use it myself wasn't the product

613
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,480
which I envisioned but all that I could

614
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,919
afford so when I got done with Army

615
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,919
basic training I had a bonus the Army

616
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,880
gives you a bonus so I had 16,000 cuz

617
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,159
it's actually a $220,000 bonus but they

618
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,159
taxed it to bits and it's just 16,000

619
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,880
did you get in your hand and I took

620
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,320
5,000 off that I was like I with this

621
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,320
$5,000 I will either transform it into

622
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,480
$50,000 or I will burn it

623
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,919
completely and I burnt it that business

624
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,360
was a flop all right didn't go anywhere

625
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,279
I ran Facebook ads I ran Instagram ads I

626
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,679
made sales on Shopify and when you get

627
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,919
that first ding on Shopify as a

628
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,360
notification that somebody bought your

629
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,760
stuff man it's a dopamine Rush unlike

630
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,320
anything else so I was selling these

631
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,200
things and then of course Co happened so

632
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,760
the shipping times expanded from 3 weeks

633
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,960
to like 3 months so that in itself was a

634
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,200
death blow to my business but another

635
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,880
thing happened the iOS update so anybody

636
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,360
who's listening who has an Ecom business

637
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,480
probably had PTSD flashbacks from the

638
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,880
iOS update so in one day the ad costs

639
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,000
went like 3x or 4X because of this

640
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,320
update and yeah business freaking died

641
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,279
all right died I didn't lose money but I

642
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,520
didn't like at the end I didn't have any

643
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,399
to show for it right I didn't have

644
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,320
product I didn't have money

645
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,960
it a dead business but I loved it I

646
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,720
wouldn't change a thing about it the

647
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
things I learned making that business

648
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,760
showed me something about myself I enjoy

649
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,840
creation I enjoy creating products I

650
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,120
enjoy marketing them and that's what set

651
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,840
me up gave me the confidence to actually

652
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,720
create this content so so long as you're

653
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,600
in the right direction of your duty

654
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,919
you're always winning there's no way to

655
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,520
lose cuz if you lose it's just data that

656
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,799
you can use for the next win so that's

657
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,120
why finding a purpose is that important

658
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:36,520
you stop losing once you find

659
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,679
it then of course I start the YouTube

660
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,039
channel KCC which is my private

661
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:45,720
Community launched to $30,000 in profit

662
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:49,520
in the first month of creation

663
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,399
so all that came from those difficult

664
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,200
months in Army basic training you don't

665
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:57,200
have to join the Army in order to find

666
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,640
your purpose I've given you the exact

667
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,159
system which I had to learn through that

668
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,919
challenge through that struggle through

669
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,440
being the wrong place the wrong

670
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,240
time with those struggles which I had to

671
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,799
deal with you don't have to do any of

672
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,080
that I'm giving you the wisdom free of

673
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:17,240
cost but even so once you complete these

674
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,799
three weeks of finding your purpose you

675
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,679
have begun to execute that's week three

676
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,919
you begun to execute on what you think

677
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,240
your purposes so in your search phase

678
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,399
you might come up with two or three

679
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,919
things which you think is your purpose

680
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:32,279
in week three you choose one of them and

681
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,320
proceed with it if you don't like it you

682
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,080
have to give it 21 days all right 21

683
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,200
days to make your decision as to whether

684
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,480
you're going to pursue this thing or not

685
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,120
for example this live streaming I don't

686
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,679
know if it's going to succeed I have no

687
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,440
way of knowing but I'm going to do it at

688
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,480
least for 21 days right at the end of 21

689
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,600
days I'll have the actual data do I like

690
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,520
it do I enjoy it do I wake up in the

691
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
morning excited to do this and of course

692
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,760
the audience reception that's important

693
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,520
too I'll only learn this if I do 21 days

694
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,559
off it so that's your du phase it could

695
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,960
be 2 3 weeks could be more if you decide

696
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,000
that you haven't found the right thing

697
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,880
that's not your purpose that's not your

698
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,679
duty that's fine just repeat listen

699
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,399
search and do again and you do this

700
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,320
again and again until you find something

701
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,960
that's actually clicking with you

702
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,679
because For the First Time in human

703
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,480
2024 is about to begin you have 365 days

729
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,880
in that year Well actually 366 I believe

730
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,519
because it's a leap

731
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,919
year you 12 months in that year I want

732
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,320
you to sacrifice well not even sacrifice

733
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:47,000
but utilize 3 weeks off that year which

734
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,720
has 52 weeks in all to really dig into

735
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,640
this method I want you to listen for

736
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
divine inspiration I want you to search

737
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,120
your childhood memories for the kind of

738
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,159
intelligence that you have from that I

739
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,919
want you to create three to five

740
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,519
different different purposes or duties

741
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,679
that you think you might have and then I

742
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,600
want you to execute on one of them to

743
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,360
see if it's the right one if it's not

744
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,279
that's fine you move on and you repeat

745
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,760
the cycle again and you try different

746
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,480
things until you find your thing I said

747
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,080
before that 18 to 25 is the search phase

748
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,960
you have unlimited opportunity to search

749
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,000
for the right thing even if you're older

750
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,399
doesn't matter it's never too late to

751
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,240
find out what your purpose is in fact

752
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:25,360
I'd go so far as to say the older you

753
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,440
are the more important it is to find

754
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,480
your duty because you have less time to

755
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,440
fulfill it now all right kind of morbid

756
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,880
but that's the case if you're older and

757
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,360
you're watching this is more important

758
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,039
than if you're younger that's the

759
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,240
hardcore truth of it you have less time

760
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,159
you don't have much time left bro all

761
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,320
right next

762
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,600
thing there's a concept of resistance

763
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
all right this is a concept which I

764
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,000
haven't really discussed much it's a

765
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,039
concept which I came across in the war

766
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,720
of art by Steven pressfield which is a

767
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:57,080
book that we as a collective in col's

768
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,799
country club we read this and the idea

769
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,039
behind behind this book is there's a

770
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,320
force called resistance there is the

771
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,039
divine inspiration which pulls you

772
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,960
forward to your destiny to your duty

773
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,840
there's an opposing Force called

774
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,159
resistance which wants to thwart you

775
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,240
wants to stop you wants to push you away

776
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,399
from your

777
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,440
duty and you know you can use that to

778
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,279
your advantage how it's because

779
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,519
resistance only appears when you are

780
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,360
trying to pursue something that actually

781
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,960
matters to you if you don't actually

782
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,320
care about something there's going to be

783
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,159
no resistance for example Le if you're

784
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,559
trying

785
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,279
to work in a coding job because you want

786
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,399
to have money resistance will give you a

787
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,080
free pass you won't feel any kind of

788
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:42,760
compulsion to not do it you'll be bribed

789
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,399
into doing it that was me I wouldn't

790
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,399
feel a lot of resistance doing

791
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:49,279
Engineering in the first few years

792
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,720
because I was just going with the flow I

793
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,760
was just doing what my parents told me

794
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,159
resistance occurs when you're doing

795
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,919
something which you actually called to

796
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,120
do for example

797
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,480
starting on YouTube I wanted to do this

798
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,639
for years and I was working with Hamza

799
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,600
right I realized he was following his

800
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:09,679
purpose and making a beautiful business

801
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,159
for himself and I could surely do the

802
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,279
same but took me a year or so since then

803
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,360
to actually get started why because of

804
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,960
resistance the resistance was telling me

805
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,039
that my parents will you know watch

806
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,480
these videos and they'll say something

807
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,360
about it my friends from high school or

808
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,919
friends from college are going to know

809
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,360
that you're on YouTube and that put me

810
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,159
off for the longest time so what made me

811
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,760
change that is because I realized that

812
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,440
the performance of your duty overrides

813
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,279
everything for two reasons first is when

814
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
you're following your duty and you're

815
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,039
doing the thing which gives you purpose

816
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
you're going to be the best at it and

817
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,440
it's likely that you're going to make

818
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,080
more money in a month than they make in

819
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,080
a year following something which is not

820
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,159
their purpose and the second piece of

821
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,360
this is of course a deeper reason when

822
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,679
you're fulfilling your purpose purpose

823
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,080
you're doing your duty on a day-to-day

824
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,880
basis doesn't really matter doesn't it

825
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,720
doesn't sting you the resistance happens

826
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,159
before you make the plunge after you

827
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,840
take the plunge there's no more

828
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,399
resistance because you've crossed the

829
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,440
Threshold at this point I'm not afraid

830
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,720
of anybody stumbling across my YouTube

831
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,639
channel even if they know me from like

832
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,200
childhood or something I don't care if

833
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:20,840
they have something to say about it

834
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,559
doesn't matter to me I'll make more than

835
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,279
them I'll live a more fulfilled life I'm

836
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,440
more freedom than then I can do what I

837
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:30,559
please it's my duty and my destiny it's

838
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,799
not anybody concerned apart from mine

839
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,840
all right so I want you to have that

840
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,760
kind of mindset do your duty at the cost

841
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,440
of anything and anybody all right your

842
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,639
duty comes first

843
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,960
the other thing which I wanted to

844
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:47,960
mention is the idea of

845
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,480
self-perception all right there's this

846
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,519
idea that success is a lag indicator of

847
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,679
self-image that is to say your

848
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,159
self-image is always going to lead your

849
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,919
success so if your self-image is behind

850
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,279
your success you're going to fail so the

851
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
question is how do you improve your

852
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,519
self-image it's a good it's a good

853
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,919
question the answer is you brainwash

854
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,720
yourself and I've been brainwashing

855
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,880
myself I've been reading this book

856
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,480
called psycho cybernetics and I've been

857
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,919
incorporating those techniques into my

858
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,480
daily life in order to be able to do

859
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:25,559
this very live lecture I've also use the

860
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,279
method of Mind rehearsals to try to do

861
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,320
these things so I had this limiting

862
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,519
belief that I needed editing right I

863
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,919
needed editing I needed to make a couple

864
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,799
edits for the videos worth watching and

865
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,480
I had this limiting belief that I would

866
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,799
have to say a sentence three or four

867
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,679
times to get it right and then chop out

868
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,880
all the bad takes and then I would have

869
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,200
a good video but when you're on live

870
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,080
call like this you don't have that

871
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,919
luxury I'm doing YouTube on hard mode

872
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,679
right now there is no background music

873
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,440
in order to boost average view duration

874
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,039
there's no cool little AI images to hit

875
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,120
you with dopamine in order to make you

876
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,919
stay the only thing I have right now is

877
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,280
my presence whatever Charisma that I can

878
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:12,679
muster my storytelling skills and of

879
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,760
course the content and the value that

880
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm providing in the video if any of

881
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,200
these core things are failing then I'm

882
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,560
not going to get the viewership that I

883
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
want it's literally that simple there's

884
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,919
no crutch that I can rely on and I had

885
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,960
this limiting belief that you know it's

886
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,599
not for me guys like Hamza he can talk

887
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,560
for like 3 4 hours and he still makes

888
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,720
sense he's still coherent he's still you

889
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,280
know making a good video like you know I

890
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,399
couldn't do that I couldn't do that but

891
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,040
I started to brainwash myself into the

892
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,960
version that I will manifest into in 3

893
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,359
years time so I I visualize what I would

894
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,040
be like in 3 years when I've already

895
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,200
done a whole bunch of live streams so

896
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,159
what's going on is let's say live

897
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,159
streaming or even speaking in public

898
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,079
right because this is public speaking I

899
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,760
am speaking in front of at least 10 10

900
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,400
people surely

901
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,480
so I have a certain skill level at

902
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,240
public speaking all right and that skill

903
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,359
level might be a six out of 10 but the

904
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,599
future version of me is going to have a

905
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:14,119
skill level of nine out of 10 if I

906
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,400
visualize and act as though I am that

907
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,880
person then my 6 out of 10 becomes seven

908
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,560
out of 10 why is that it's because I'm

909
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,280
more receptive more relaxed I am more at

910
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,240
ease with myself I'm okay with making

911
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,560
mistakes why because if I believe myself

912
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,119
to be a 9 out of 10 public speaker I

913
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,240
know I have the fundamentals I know I

914
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,560
have the skills if I mess up it's just a

915
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,800
one-off occurrence it's not going to

916
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,480
break my flow it's not going to impede

917
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,000
on my ability to

918
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,119
speak believing myself to be a 9 out of

919
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,079
10 speaker makes me a seven out of 10

920
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,000
speaker rather than a six but now the

921
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,480
question is like how do you actually

922
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
brainwash yourself what's the exact

923
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,440
actionable step autistic level detail

924
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,920
and that is going to be the topic of

925
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,760
tomorrow's video I'm going to make a

926
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,760
video tomorrow exactly same time it's

927
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,920
going to be live streamed it's also

928
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,480
going to be available as a recording of

929
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,240
how to brainwash yourself for success in

930
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,880
2024 so here's the thing I'm aware that

931
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm making mistakes in this call which

932
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,760
is fine I'm 100% okay with it it's

933
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,960
literally my second attempt I'm not

934
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,359
going to give myself a hard time about

935
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,720
it because I feel like or I am embodying

936
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:20,000
the spirit of a nine out of 10 speaker a

937
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,359
nine out of 10 speaker isn't thrown off

938
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,839
by one word misspoken or one story which

939
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,119
didn't hit the point as hard as it

940
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,079
should doesn't matter n out of 10

941
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,599
speaker has that kind of confidence so

942
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,560
tomorrow I'm going to teach you how to

943
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,800
brainwash yourself for success of course

944
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,880
it doesn't have to be public speaking it

945
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,280
could be literally anything I don't know

946
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,839
playing the guitar talking to women so

947
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,920
brainwashing yourself is the elite

948
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,800
technique on how to talk to

949
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,640
women without these thoughts these

950
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,119
nagging thoughts which sabotage you but

951
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,760
of course you know that's tomorrow's

952
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,480
topic so let's not get into it too

953
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,800
deeply today today I have homework for

954
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,839
you so you think these lectures are free

955
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,160
no sir I demand a fee I demand a fee for

956
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,680
these lectures that fee is the homework

957
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,079
which I'm going to give you right now I

958
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,680
want you to go for a contemplative walk

959
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,000
like I described earlier in this lecture

960
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,520
I want you to go for a contemplative

961
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,079
walk ideally it's outdoors but of course

962
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,599
not everybody has a luxury of living in

963
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,720
beautiful Hawaii like I do so I

964
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,560
understand it may not be possible but go

965
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,040
for a walk inside your own room

966
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,119
literally Pace in your own room and I

967
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,960
want you to have zero distractions no

968
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,640
phone no Internet your computer switched

969
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,839
off your phone Switched Off you have

970
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,680
something to write with you have your

971
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,680
pencil and your paper and you're going

972
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,680
to write down any thoughts which come to

973
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,839
you if they're negative thoughts they're

974
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,040
limiting beliefs I want you to trace

975
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:47,319
back where they came from so that you

976
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:49,720
can destroy them and if if if you feel

977
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,520
the divine inspiration then that is a

978
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,280
blessing take it

979
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,119
seriously write down that feeling of

980
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,720
divine inspiration you might just get an

981
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,760
idea just out of the blue like a

982
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,079
lightning bolt it's just going to shock

983
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,200
you it's going to be like damn that's a

984
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,680
good idea I can do that I can succeed at

985
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
that write that down as well I want you

986
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,000

995
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,560
thought from divine inspiration and you

1000
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:38,680
in the comment section when I upload

1001
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,560
this record this live stream as a

1002
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,839
recording that is your homework for

1003
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,520
today tomorrow's lecture is going to be

1004
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:47,960
how to brainwash yourself for success in

1005
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,760
2024 and if you missed yesterday's

1006
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,400
lecture that was a lecture on how to

1007
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,480
master any skill I have a system called

1008
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,359
the magic hourglass method teaches you

1009
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,319
how to master literally anything so once

1010
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,480
you you have your purpose good how do

1011
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,800
you actually get good at that purpose

1012
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,480
right for for for that content

1013
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,760
yesterday's lecture I'll have the tile

1014
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,720
pop up for that tomorrow's lecture is

1015
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,839
how to brainwash yourself so the idea

1016
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,359
behind these lecture videos is basically

1017
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:16,480
give you a tool set a tool kit

1018
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,240
of success in general right I'll of

1019
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,359
course go doing lectures on health I'll

1020
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,240
do stuff on supplements I'll do stuff on

1021
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,640
nutrition as well but all that is

1022
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,400
peripheral to the Core

1023
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,280
importance of Duty and purpose so I'm

1024
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,640
going to go grab my camera I'm flip it

1025
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,760
around I'm going to look at your

1026
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,400
questions and see if I can't answer them

1027
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,800
for the next 5 minutes and then we'll

1028
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,480
close out for today appreciate your time

1029
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
and I will see you

1030
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,079
tomorrow let's see if I can't turn this

1031
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,079
around all right

1032
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:58,000
bet I can't see the chat did I not

1033
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,040
enable chat today

1034
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,760
yeah okay you saw here boys 100% proof

1035
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,160
that I am actually yeah I don't

1036
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,040
think chat are

1037
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,920
enabled or maybe I just don't know what

1038
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,880
I'm doing

1039
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,359
no I I I can okay so alza says my

1040
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,520
mission struck me like a lightning

1041
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,359
recently took me 3 months to finally

1042
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,240
find it what was your mission

1043
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:25,640
man you can't just leave us like that

1044
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,760
Bernie sandal says will you be bringing

1045
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,359
back cooking to tutorials I will but

1046
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,000
likely on my second channel so

1047
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,640
immediately after this lecture is given

1048
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
right I'm going to jump onto my second

1049
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,359
Channel and I'm going to work out I'm

1050
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,000
going to do it on live stream so that my

1051
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,599
intensity is held accountable and I will

1052
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,880
also be doing cooking and other stuff

1053
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:47,359
like that on live chat all right so

1054
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,359
that's the answer for that and then we

1055
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,160
have

1056
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,160
Andreas Killa asks how old are you 28

1057
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,319
all right so getting close to 30 at this

1058
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,319
point

1059
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,079
ala also says even if your duty won't

1060
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,200
make you money fast it's still more

1061
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,800
worth overall that's true and it's quite

1062
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
likely that you will make money all

1063
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,720
right don't have the limiting belief

1064
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,160
that if you're following your duty that

1065
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,280
you're not going to make money quite

1066
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:20,400
often the opposite is true all right

1067
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,880
keep that in mind cool I will of course

1068
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,880
answer questions in the comments as well

1069
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,920
so when this is uploaded as an actual

1070
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,160
video feel free to ask it there all

1071
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,960
right boys I'll see you in the next one

1072
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,960
have a nice day
