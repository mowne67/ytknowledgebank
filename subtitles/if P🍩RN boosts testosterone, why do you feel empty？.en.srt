1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
Porn actually boosts your testosterone.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,120
However, the boost is only 10% and the

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,920
prolactin spike that you will inevitably

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,160
receive will crush any testosterone

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,799
boost. So, prolactin is the hormone of

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,960
postnut clarity. It releases right after

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,039
your nut to shut down your sex drive.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,760
So, prolactin is actually designed for

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,920
this. It's literally designed to clamp

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
down your ambition, clamp down your

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,400
energy, and destroy your momentum. This

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
is the hormone that makes you feel

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,760
empty. Why would such a hormone even

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,600
exist? It's because it serves a valuable

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,520
purpose. If you're with your wife or a

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,879
woman who you can expect to be your

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,399
wife, then this is the chemical of pair

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,120
bonding. It makes you feel empty because

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,160
it allows her to fill you up with her

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,800
presence and warmth. But of course, the

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,719
problem is if you're with somebody who's

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,280
a rando who you're just hooking up with,

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,000
or worse, what if she's just pixels on a

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
screen? then the emptiness will not be

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
satiated. The emptiness will not be

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
filled. Instead, the emptiness will

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
consume you. People think that the

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
opposite of testosterone is estrogen.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,360
But this is not true. The opposite of

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,439
testosterone is prolactin. Just as

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,479
testosterone makes effort and taking

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,680
risks feel rewarding, prolactin makes

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,600
effort and risk feel painful. If you

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
spike your prolactin without anybody to

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,360
attach to, then it leads to a cascade of

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,000
negative emotion and a depressed hormone

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,880
engine. So, here's the rules. Zero

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,920
tolerance policy on porn. You need to

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,320
release some steam. I get it. Just don't

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,119
use porn. Use your imaginations like

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,840
your ancestors did. If you are married

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
or have a girl, consciously reduce sex

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
to two to three times a week. Now, that

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
is to say, you're making yourself the

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
scarce resource. You will have a better

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,720
sex life and so will she. If you decide

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
to abstain completely, you will

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,360
experience nocturnal emission. It means

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
that you you're going to have dreams

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
which will take care of business. This

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
is normal and should happen once a month

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
or more. Generally speaking, you want to

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
minimize prolactin unless you are in the

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,599
special circumstance where you are

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
expecting to be a father. This is one of

56
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,200
those times where testosterone should

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
not be the dominant hormone and instead

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
the peaceful hormones like serotonin,

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,560
oxytocin and prolactin should take over.

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,680
In fact, prolactin does this. It nukes

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,760
dopamine and it nukes testosterone. Why?

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
Because in combination, these two

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,640
hormones can cause a man to seek out a

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,599
new partner. Not ideal behavior for a

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,840
new father. Prolactin also upregulates

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,920
serotonin, which causes a relaxed and

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
blissed out state. quite common to see

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,280
in new parents. Now, I'm going to make a

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,000
controversial scientific hypothesis. My

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,040
belief is that people can tell if you

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,760
watch porn or engage in meaningless sex.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,400
We know that we have as humans a

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,560
pheromone system. They did an experiment

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,080
with which took a large number of men

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,080
and women who were in long-term

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,159
relationships. They wanted to see if

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
these women could identify the t-shirts

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,360
of their partners using their nose.

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,760
Turns out they absolutely could. And the

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,560
crazy thing is women could identify the

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
correct t-shirt even without the smell.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,720
So what they did was they they washed

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,200
these t-shirts multiple times to destroy

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,760
the actual smell molecules. So indeed

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
the women didn't say they smelt the

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
t-shirt to be like their partner. They

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
just said they felt an inner voice or

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
feeling that it was the case. In other

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
words, women could detect their mate at

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,280
a subconscious level. We also know that

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,920
chemical signaling is all too common in

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,680
nature. The mere presence of a sexually

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
mature male in the presence of young

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
females of a given species will cause

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
the young females to reach puberty

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
faster. The presence of a novel male

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,120
near a pregnant female can cause a

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,599
spontaneous miscarriage. So I make the

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,840
following hypothesis. If a man has a

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,159
high prolactin spike paired with low

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,120
dopamine and low testosterone and high

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,239
cortisol, this hormone profile signals

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
to a human female that he is well, he's

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
already pair bonded. He's going to be a

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
father, so there's no point in her being

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
attracted to him. So essentially, if you

107
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
are consuming porn, if you're jacking

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,639
off a lot, to be more blunt, you are

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,199
telling your females around you that you

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
are not receptive to them. Essentially,

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
you'd be putting out signals of a

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
stressed, pair-bonded father rather than

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
a stud actively looking for a mate. So

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,800
if you want a real woman in your life,

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
you must reject the virtual ones.
