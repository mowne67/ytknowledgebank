1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,279
making decisions in life is hard most

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,560
people are indecisive and they're filled

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,760
with self-doubt if we are able to make

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,639
decisions with confidence and follow

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,880
through with conviction then this gives

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,000
us an asymmetric advantage over the rest

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,680
of society people suck at

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,039
decision-making because they're taught

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,760
that logic and reason always lead to the

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,599
correct choice but here's the reality

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,560
that most people never realize

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,439
rationality just leads to

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,519
rationalizations half the time we've

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
already made up the decision in our

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
minds and we're just using logic to

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,320
justify it this is stupid this is stupid

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
because you're not getting the benefits

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,039
of cold hard logic nor are you embracing

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,320
the power of human intuition you're

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,559
losing on on both sides in this video

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm going to show you how to make better

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,320
choices because we all have choices to

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,320
make should you start a business should

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
you stay in school should you ask her on

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,120
a date or wait till you do more looks

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,359
maxing or should you quit your job now

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,000
should you wait till you have more

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,840
savings there's so many decisions each

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
decision has pros and cons in real life

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,519
there are no Solutions there's only

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
trade-offs and even if you make the

32
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,320
perfect decision after making this full

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,759
pros and cons list the outcome is often

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,280
outside your control on top of this if

35
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,000
you avoid making decisions you lose

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,040
because others will make that decision

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,360
for you and if you constantly doubt your

38
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,119
decision you still lose because

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,240
circumstances will make the decision for

40
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,600
you so you have to make decisions and

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
you have to have the confidence that

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,040
it'll work out in the end so what do we

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
do no human has perfect knowledge no no

44
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,399
human can predict the future and all

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,680
humans have limited time on this Earth

46
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,040
how do we stop having regrets at what

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,200
could have been how do we stop wasting

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
years of our life on stuff that doesn't

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,079
really matter I'm going to give you a

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,520
tool that's helped me make decisions

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,159
quickly that leave me with zero regret

52
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,360
this tool has given me the peace of mind

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,560
to see a decision through to its

54
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,240
conclusion and not have regret even if

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
the outcome isn't exactly what I

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,000
expected it to be this tool is called

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,640
the eudemonic compass here I must

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,240
confess that it took me a decade to find

59
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,439
my identity my ethos and what I wanted

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,599
to do for a living I don't want you to

61
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,599
go through the same unnecessary

62
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,160
sacrifices and avoidable pains I jumped

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,239
around a lot in life I went to one of

64
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,959
the top American engineering colleges

65
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,840
and at the end I felt crushing

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,560
depression because I never really cared

67
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,080
about thermodynamics or turbulent flow I

68
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,200
did it because my parents vision for me

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
until going to engineering school then I

70
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,319
joined the PHD program in biosciences

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
because it would give me a very fine

72
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,120
road towards success it give me Prestige

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,360
among my peers to have a PhD then I quit

74
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,720
and I joined the army hoping to get as

75
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,000
far from Academia and the traditional

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,000
career path as possible luckily this was

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
the start of my self-mastery journey

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
because I was able to dedicate eight

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,879
months of my life to physical effort in

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,000
the form of getting smoked every day and

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,560
the mental effort of writing and

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,080
thinking oh I should show you so there's

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,080
three journals right here I don't know

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,400
if you can see it I don't know if it's

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,400
within frame but these three journals

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,640
are completely full every single line is

87
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,840
filled by my thoughts and inpections

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
that I wrote down during basic training

89
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,920
and to this day these journals provide

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,799
insights that I use to make videos I

91
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,519
used to carry these journals everywhere

92
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,959
I used to go during training I used to

93
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,280
carry them to the M4 range during Rock

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,560
marches wherever I went one of these

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
journals came with me whenever there was

96
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,799
downtime I'd be riding so many guys

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,280
would be asking me you know what are you

98
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,560
writing in there well one of the things

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,000
I was writing was my problems in life

100
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,200
basically I was doing a self-analysis

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,480
one of my problems in life I

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,000
triangulated was that I wasn't able to

103
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,760
make or stick to decisions when I was a

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,920
kid I was decisive I was curious I was

105
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,599
driven I was Fearless but with time the

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,159
education system just ground me into the

107
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,920
dirt and shaped me into the Cog they

108
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,879
wanted me to be there are all these

109
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,760
pressures man what would my parents

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,439
think how would I make money how would

111
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,680
it look on the resume May what would

112
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,640
girls think all this [ __ ] without

113
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,319
asking the main question of what would

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,599
future me think would I be proud of my

115
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,120
past decisions or would I feel guilty it

116
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,799
was then that I created this tool this

117
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,440
emonic compass that has never failed me

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,400
there are two types of situations in

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,400
life situations that are within your

120
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,639
control and situations which are outside

121
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,840
your control I'm going to give you a

122
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,360
prayer that I like give me the courage

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,280
to control that which I can give me the

124
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,280
stoicism to accept that which I cannot

125
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
give me the wisdom to tell the

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,440
difference in some cases we don't have

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,039
control the death of a loved one famine

128
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,120
disease all these things right but in

129
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,520
most things we do have control over our

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,600
destiny and when we make choices it

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,840
matters luckily we have deep intuitions

132
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,160
within us to help us make decisions I

133
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,240
used to think that good decisions are

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,199
made with cold logic and brutal

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,039
reasoning now I have more trust in my

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,000
intuition now I'm going to teach you

137
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,199
exactly how to develop that this does

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,479
not mean I just do whatever I feel like

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,320
doing there's a structure to this most

140
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,759
modern people make decisions based on

141
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,680
perceived pleasure humans are actually

142
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,880
terrible at predicting how much pleasure

143
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
and action will give them we've all felt

144
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,560
the pull of Temptation we've all yielded

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,240
to the pull of Temptation there's no

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
need for me to give examples because

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,280
every one of us has yielded to the

148
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,039
weakness of the flesh at some point but

149
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,000
in the aftermath the pleasure is nowhere

150
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,160
to be found replaced by emptiness the

151
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,319
pleasure never lasts and our prediction

152
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,080
about how much pleasure we're going to

153
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,039
get is always a miscalculation so what

154
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,160
have we stopped using pleasure as the

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,880
North Star what have we got off the

156
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,960
honic treadmill the honic treadmill is

157
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,160
when you continue to walk and walk and

158
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,160
never really get anywhere because the

159
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,960
pleasures start fading away and you keep

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,639
walking forward seeking for more

161
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,560
Pleasures which in turn Fade Away there

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,400
is a better way we can use this emonic

163
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,319
Compass UD demonic is the opposite of

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,479
hedonic emonic is pursuing happiness

165
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,560
through actions that give you a sense of

166
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:08,000
Pride and accomplishment rather than

167
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,560
pleasure Pride Stacks pleasure decays

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
and that's the chief difference between

169
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,400
the two a good gym session brings you

170
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,120
pride pride and accomplishment but in

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,919
the same gym session if you slacked off

172
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,919
and you knew you could have gone harder

173
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,520
you bring a sense of guilt if you

174
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,120
prepare a highly testosterone's meal of

175
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,319
lamb and carrots you feel Pride but if

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
you Chow Down some seed oil slop then

177
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,039
you will feel guilt if you resist

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,319
watching porn you will feel Pride if you

179
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,520
fall to weakness you'll feel guilt

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,160
humans are good at predicting Pride but

181
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,720
they're amazing at predicting guilt

182
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,880
whenever you're making a complex

183
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
decision or you're in a new situation

184
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,520
you can predict which decision will

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,960
leave you with a sense of guilt seeking

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,840
pleasure is always an unreliable North

187
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Star but avoiding guilt will not lead

188
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,080
you astray I spoke about Pride but isn't

189
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,960
Pride bad I don't think so is it wrong

190
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,800
to work for years to have a phys that

191
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,479
you're proud of is it wrong for your

192
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,960
parents to be proud of you when you

193
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,759
finally retire them when you have kids

194
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,599
and they grow into strong independent

195
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,720
men and women with their own missions

196
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,879
would it be wrong to feel pride in their

197
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,599
achievements would it be wrong to have

198
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,879
pride in a job well done a day's honest

199
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,120
labor Victory won by the strength of

200
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,319
your hand of course not from all this

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,120
and more we know that Pride as such is

202
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,879
not bad yet the ancient texts warn us of

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Pride but if you read deeper these texts

204
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,440
aren't talking about the type of Pride

205
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,319
that I described they're talking about

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,240
hubris or egotism that's when you think

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,280
you're Flawless and perfect that's when

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
you have pride without gratitude for

209
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,479
example there's nothing wrong with

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,400
having pride in an aesthetic physique

211
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,919
however when the ego gets too attach to

212
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,840
the physique then you're setting up

213
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,400
yourself for failure Chris Williamson

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,639
talks about this with Tim Ferris how

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Chris even though he's an amazing shape

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,639
he started to see the signs of aging at

217
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,319
some point he's not going to get better

218
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,280
physically he's going to start slowing

219
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,560
down Chris talks about how if all his

220
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,960
ego is invested into his physique he'd

221
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,599
be going into depression you can see

222
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,199
egotism when influencers Turn On Their

223
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,879
audience when they start losing traction

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,000
you can see hubris when corrupt

225
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,199
politicians thinks that they deserve

226
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,840
power or when Bankers leverage

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,560
everything for more returns egotism is

228
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
when a businessman has no gratitude

229
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,720
towards his employees his customers or

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,199
his advisers I think you can see the

231
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,519
difference from having a healthy level

232
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,039
of pride in oneself versus being

233
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,919
hubristic or egotistical I think the

234
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
word pride is confusing because it's

235
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,519
changed meaning over the years and this

236
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
happens all the time happens in all

237
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,720
languages Jordan Peterson actually gives

238
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
an example of the word meek there's a

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,040
famous phrase the meek shall inherit the

240
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,560
earth in today's English Meek means

241
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,560
submissive but in older times actually

242
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,480
the word meant being peaceful until

243
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,640
provoked so don't get stuck on the

244
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,120
language language is just a tool of

245
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,360
communication and it's not perfect focus

246
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,279
on the terrain not the map focus on the

247
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,680
concepts rather than the exact words

248
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,880
that I'm using when I'm talking about

249
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,240
pride in this video I'm obviously

250
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
talking about Good Pride not hubris not

251
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,760
arrogance not egotism now let's discuss

252
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,720
how to use this y demonic Compass when

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
you're confronted with a fork in the

254
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,560
road you often know which road will lead

255
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,120
to guilt and which one leads to Pride

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,320
even in a complicated situation where

257
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,320
you don't know what the outcome will be

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
you can ask yourself the question which

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,959
option leads to Pride and which one is

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,800
going to give me guilt literally cannot

261
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,440
make a bad decision if you do this

262
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,519
instead of asking how much money will I

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,000
make or how much Prestige will I get or

264
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,760
what will my parents think what will the

265
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,720
girls think what would the resume look

266
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,800
like ask yourself would I feel good

267
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,040
about this in the future the interesting

268
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,760
thing is even if you have a less than

269
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,240
optimal outcome you won't feel guilty

270
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,800
because that was the best decision you

271
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,640
could have made given your current

272
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,680
knowledge if you focus on stacking pride

273
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,760
and reducing the level of guilt then you

274
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,680
win in the long term in fact you win in

275
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,320
the short term as well as the longterm

276
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,920
I'll explain the exact mechanism why

277
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,200
that's the case if you follow this

278
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,839
principle of Pride stacking even over a

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,640
week it will change your self-perception

280
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,880
in some sense you're winning your own

281
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,640
respect and you should start small every

282
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,760
day we have small choices to make should

283
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,800
you wake up and step out into the Sun or

284
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
should stay scrolling on your phone on

285
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,800
your bed should you go for a walk

286
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
outside or play video games should you

287
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,800
call your parents should you study for

288
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,200
your exams should you be honest should

289
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,079
you lie if you make the the choice based

290
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,839
on which road leads to Pride and

291
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
accomplishment then you're winning your

292
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,160
own respect when I was making the

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
decision to show my face on camera and

294
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,320
stand by my beliefs I earned my respect

295
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
by doing what I believed was right when

296
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,120
I quit the biosciences PHD program

297
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,440
despite working so hard to get in I won

298
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,720
my respect by willing to bet on myself

299
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,120
when I defeated my addictions I won my

300
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
respect by proving to myself that I am a

301
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,399
man who keeps his promises when I got

302
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
through the Infantry Warfare school I

303
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,440
won my respect by proving that I had

304
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,000
what it took this Pride stacking concept

305
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,240
has changed the way I see decision-

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,880
making it's no longer a matter of pros

307
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
and cons and Min maxing it's no longer a

308
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
matter of just optimization it's a

309
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,959
matter of building my psyche that's what

310
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,800
every single decision point in life is

311
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,839
it's not the actual outcomes which stack

312
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,279
it's how you build your psyche because

313
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,120
every time your psyche is built and

314
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,120
becomes more antifragile becomes

315
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,320
stronger your strength of character has

316
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,959
improved you'll just have a higher and

317
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,000
higher chance of making the right call

318
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,639
in the next decision that you make

319
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,279
that's how you really stack success

320
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,959
that's what I've recently learned it's

321
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,000
not like I'm some wise old guy who's

322
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,399
lived you know 30 years doing this this

323
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,399
is something I learned in the last few

324
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,120
years it served me well and so I'm

325
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,959
communicating this with you you're

326
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,480
teaching your subconscious that you are

327
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,399
a person worthy of your own trust and

328
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,360
respect they say that you can't force or

329
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
buy respect and that's true and

330
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,880
certainly it is true when you're talking

331
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,279
about self-respect you can only earn

332
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,959
respect and especially self-respect

333
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,320
because there can be no deception or

334
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,079
trickery you know all your dirty secrets

335
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,320
you know when you fail you know when you

336
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,839
lie to yourself you cannot trick the

337
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,399
subconscious it's always looking at you

338
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,639
and there is no shortcut to be had when

339
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,639
you choose the guilty option versus

340
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
Pride you're chipping away at your

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
psyche eventually you'll have a

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,279
fragmented psyche this is the kind of

343
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
psyche that most modern people have

344
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,800
people have a disconnect between what

345
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
they think they should do and what they

346
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,079
actually do this gap between what you

347
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,639
think should be done and what you

348
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,880
actually do is the source of pain I

349
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,720
found that as I shrink this Gap nice and

350
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
slowly every year I've been just more

351
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,160
content with the person that I am the

352
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,600
things that I'm doing I'm making better

353
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,760
decisions and that's translating in all

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
kinds of success relationships money

355
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,040
everything most people don't know this

356
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,040
but the most valuable asset you have is

357
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,360
your character nobody's talking about

358
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,560
how to train the character and what I'm

359
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,320
describing so far is really Progressive

360
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,160
overload for your psyche people go to

361
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,199
the gym to get big they go to college to

362
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,639
appear smart but size and intelligence

363
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,079
don't correlate with making better

364
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,959
decisions the strength of character is

365
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,079
the only thing that correlates with

366
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,680
better decision-making and sadly this is

367
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,760
the metric on which the modern society

368
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,800
fails this is the metric which I want to

369
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,399
strengthen because at the end of the day

370
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,680
character is Destiny not genetics not

371
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,720
height not education not IQ character is

372
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,920
Destiny above all else if you don't

373
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
train your psyche when you are young and

374
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,440
you have less responsibility then when

375
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,639
you grow older and you have really big

376
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,600
decisions later in life having kids

377
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,040
getting married buying a house selling

378
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,839
your business starting a business

379
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,079
whatever right then you're going to be

380
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,800
unprepared another reason to use the ud

381
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,519
demonic Compass over the honic treadmill

382
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,360
is that it forces morality and morality

383
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,320
is a strategic advantage in the long run

384
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,720
should you cheat on your exam or just

385
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,759
take the L should you lie on your resume

386
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,800
to get the job should you mislead your

387
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,160
business partner should you exaggerate

388
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,040
your products to get more sales the

389
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,720
dishonest answer will give you better

390
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,600
results in the short term but You' be

391
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,440
teaching your subconscious that you are

392
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
fundamentally dishonest if your

393
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,279
subconscious cannot trust you then it

394
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,839
will sabotage you no man can feel pride

395
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,320
and dishonesty only guilt by making

396
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,480
decisions to minimize long-term guilt

397
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,199
you're actually maximizing long-term

398
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,639
profit and you're doing this by building

399
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,320
a reputation of honesty and quality that

400
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,320
others can see but also your own

401
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,759
subconscious can see this y demonic

402
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,279
compass works great when you're making

403
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,720
strategic decisions my third ever

404
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,639
YouTube video got 400,000 views in just

405
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,279
3 weeks absolute Black Swan event

406
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,959
unpredictable right completely

407
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,279
unpredictable that's what Black Swan

408
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,839
events are they can be life-changing but

409
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,079
not repeatable so I had to make a choice

410
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,079
I had a good job at the time I was doing

411
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,759
well I landed an engineering job with a

412
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,199
startup that made food preservation

413
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,440
systems it is fairly meaningful worked I

414
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,720
enjoyed it to some extent I had decent

415
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,040
freedom I had a good paycheck and I was

416
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,399
on track to even gain equity in the

417
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,800
company my parents were happy I was

418
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,600
making similar money to other

419
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
engineering friends I was on track man I

420
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,800
was finally on track after so many

421
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,320
different trials and testing and doing

422
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,480
different things on one hand I had the

423
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
safety of the job which I understood on

424
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,000
the other hand YouTube is fickle yes I

425
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
had one video take off but that's not a

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,800
guarantee of income I had to make a

427
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,040
decision and the decision boiled down to

428
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,560
B basically the tides of Fortune had

429
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,920
handed me this prize in the form of this

430
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,920
video just randomly taking off if I

431
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,360
didn't grab this opportunity I would

432
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,519
feel guilty forever because my dream was

433
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,440
always to be a creative businessman not

434
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,040
an engineer if I commit to

435
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,800
entrepreneurship and take a chance of

436
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,839
myself then I would feel Pride

437
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,759
regardless of the outcome on the other

438
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
hand if I chose the path of safety

439
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,279
despite the opportunity falling into my

440
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,480
lap then I would feel guilt forever

441
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,759
framing it like that it became a less

442
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,360
hard dis I choose the thing that made me

443
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,120
feel self accomplishment and pride and

444
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,519
don't choose a thing that I knew would

445
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,800
make me feel guilty Forever by the way

446
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,079
if you're in a position in life where

447
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,279
you're trying to strategize and look

448
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,800
towards the future trying to make

449
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,120
decisions or if you're trying to do

450
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,920
Health optimization especially hormonal

451
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,920
and testosterone optimization I've

452
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,519
recently opened up one-on-one coaching

453
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,160
very temporary you should look in the

454
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,720
description for the scheduling link and

455
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
also I should say this is actually part

456
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,399
two of a two-part series part one

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,279
discusses Chad flation how competition

458
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,839
is speeding up and what you can do about

459
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,680
it you should watch that video to

460
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,240
complete your knowledge and closing out

461
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
I want to tell you one thing if you

462
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,759
remember nothing else from this video I

463
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,839
want you to remember this one sentence

464
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,000
we all make choices but in the end our

465
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,000
choices make us
