1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
you took me from 25 Subs to 800 Subs in

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,500
one day and then to 1300 Subs overnight

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,200
and you'd think I was extremely happy

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,240
about this which I am however there was

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,519
this undercurrent of nervousness which

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,740
is bothering me I read every single

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,660
comment that was left all hundreds of

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,699
them and every comment I was always

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,320
thinking the next comment is going to be

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,359
the racist one it's going to be the one

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,279
which kind of ruins my day and affects

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,779
my mood but that never happened so you

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,760
have to understand I'm not one of these

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,740
like liberal types I'm not looking for

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,239
racism I'm not a feminist none of that

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,739
in fact I'd probably consider myself

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,180
more of a conservative than anything

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,620
else I don't even mean that in a

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,660
political sense because both parties in

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,579
the US kind of suck I just mean that I

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,780
always assumed I was the thick-skinned

22
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,340
kind of guy and I wouldn't care about

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,320
things like this so I was on the lookout

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,579
for comments you know calling out my

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,020
accent or my appearance or something

26
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,760
like this and that just never happened

27
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,379
and by the way guys this is how you tell

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,180
if your bread is good or not all it

29
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,399
should have is enriched flour water

30
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,840
olive oil sea salt and herbs if that's

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,219
all the ingredients you have you have a

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,780
good piece of bread that's when I

33
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,840
realized it wasn't a fear of racism for

34
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,119
me it was internal self-limiting beliefs

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,460
that manifested themselves as this

36
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,380
irrational fear every comment I read has

37
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,360
been overwhelmingly positive my boys

38
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,340
were in India were just so thrilled that

39
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,080
I was using ghee instead of oil to make

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,939
my omelette this just goes to show you

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,860
that perhaps the demons are not always

42
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,380
out there but sometimes the demons are

43
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,180
in here they were for me for the longest

44
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,439
time I put off YouTube I put off you

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,000
know making videos and all this because

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,040
I always assumed that people would be

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,840
terrible to me online and this is such a

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
weird topic for me to discuss because I

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,320
don't have a victim mindset or anything

50
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,820
like this I go about my life in real

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,220
life full of confidence I don't

52
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,020
necessarily fear exposure so where is

53
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,479
this coming from so there's this book

54
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,460
called The War of art written by Stephen

55
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
pressfield and Stephen pressfield is an

56
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,360
author of Epic War literature and he

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
writes this book which is very popular

58
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,659
among creative types and business types

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,060
and by the way guys you should always

60
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,979
purchase extra virgin olive oil and

61
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,780
ideally not Blended this is the stuff

62
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,579
which has a lot of antioxidants and it's

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,740
really good for healthy fats that it

64
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,180
contains and in this book The War of art

65
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,100
Stephen pressfield talks about

66
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,420
resistance resistance not just

67
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,220
resistance doing something but

68
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
resistance with the capital r like a

69
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,940
proper noun resistance and he talks

70
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,200
about how for every single person who

71
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,580
ever tries to create something whether

72
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,620
it be content or whether it be a

73
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,420
business every single person has a

74
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,280
resistance within them which takes the

75
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,540
shape of their worst insecurity but the

76
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,580
fact is this video is not even actually

77
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,500
about racism this video is about one

78
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,300
man's journey through his insecurities

79
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,400
and emerging on the other side A Little

80
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,080
Bit Stronger thanks to you everybody who

81
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,879
left comments encouraging me to create

82
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,260
more content I think I might now coming

83
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,879
back to the more important thing this

84
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,980
amazing breakfast that I'm preparing I

85
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,680
have high quality bread high quality

86
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,959
olive oil and all my middle eastern boys

87
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,060
out there you know how nutritious dates

88
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,739
are also everybody has this thing

89
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,720
against chocolate but if you have even

90
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,340
70 above dark chocolate it's actually

91
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,260
really good for you in fact I prefer

92
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,180
dark chocolate over coffee both of them

93
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,040
contain caffeine but this is combined

94
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,300
with healthy fats and so it kind of

95
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,099
modifies the effect of caffeine and

96
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,080
doesn't make you jittery or doesn't have

97
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,879
the caffeine crash effect this is the

98
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,180
good stuff a block of chocolate and then

99
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,560
this right here is a egg milkshake crazy

100
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,720
right you never think you would make an

101
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,879
egg milkshake it's amazing it has two

102
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,840
eggs a whole bunch of milk extremely

103
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,580
good extremely good nutritious breakfast

104
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,319
so here's your homework think about the

105
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,420
thing that you have been wanting to do

106
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,220
or wanting to try but you haven't been

107
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,200
able to because you've had this internal

108
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,239
resistance within you write down what

109
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
shape that resistance is taking and then

110
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,739
test the assumptions I assume that the

111
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,659
internet was a bad place full of bad

112
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,340
people who would seek to insult and

113
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,379
bring me down this assumption was born

114
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,659
to be false each of you left a comment

115
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,580
had nothing but praise and encouragement

116
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,799
for me you have helped me realize that

117
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,480
the pursuit of one's purpose is as much

118
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,340
an internal Journey as an external one

119
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,200
and for that I thank you and of course

120
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,560
thank you to my editor Jan for editing

121
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,560
