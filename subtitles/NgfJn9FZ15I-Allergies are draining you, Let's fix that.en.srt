00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,359
This box contains the legendary Navage

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,440
device. One of the most effective tools

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,080
against allergies. So, what is this

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,360
thing? How did I come buy it? And how do

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
you actually use it? That's what I'm

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
going to discuss. So, I found this

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,840
randomly in a CVS store and I purchased

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
it and I tried it and it was actually

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
life-changing. How it works is it has

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,880
two containers. What you do is you fill

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,760
the top container with water, clean

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,160
water, so filtered or boiled. And what

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
it does, it has a pump inside and it

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
passes water through one nostril and out

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,559
the other and it collects the water in

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
this bottom container. This is

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,120
essentially a way to clean your airways

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,879
and remove allergens. So I know this is

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,879
effective. In fact, I this is so

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,640
effective that whenever I travel, I

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,920
still carry it with me despite being

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
kind of heavy and bulky. This is

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
something which I suggest to almost

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
everybody in Crusade Labs. One of the

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
members, Teemo, he tried it recently and

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
he reported that when he tried the first

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,879
time, this thing, the bottom container,

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,199
just collected a bunch of fleg, mucus,

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,840
and even blood. And this is actually a

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
common thing. Many people will find that

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
the first time they use it is almost

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,920
unpleasant, but also a relief because

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
think about it, there's so much junk in

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
the airways of your skull. If you have

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
allergies, it's better out than in. This

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
is a common thing which happens. The

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
first time you use it, hell, the first

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,520
week you use it, you'll collect so much

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,159
mucus like infection like tissue and

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,640
even blood, clotted blood in this thing,

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
but once it's out of the body, you feel

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
amazing. So, I've been using it for more

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
than 6 months at this point and nowadays

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
it's almost clear water which comes out.

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
But in the start, yeah, it wasn't that

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,600
way. This is essentially like a ni pot.

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
It performs a similar function. However,

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,479
because it has a pump and it pulls water

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
through. It just works way better. So,

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,280
when you're actually using this, here

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,880
are some tactical things that I found

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,640
which make the experience better. It's

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
very important that you use clean water.

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,759
You do not want to be passing just

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,520
straight tap water through your airways.

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
That's just a recipe for disaster. So,

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439
you want to be using RO filter or

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,439
boiled. I still add methylene blue to

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
this because methylene blue is a

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,879
disinfectant. It destroys bacteria. It

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
destroys bofilms. It destroys viruses.

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,360
It destroys fungus. So that makes sure

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
that the water that I pass through is

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
free of those things. But also the same

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
benefits inside the airways of course

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,239
destroys fungus, destroys bacteria of

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,640
course and the water removes the

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
allergens. So really nice if you have

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
any of these symptoms. And for

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
maintenance this is also important.

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,879
Every month at least one time you have

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
to put in couple drops of alcohol with

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,400
your water and just run it through like

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
obviously not run it through your nose.

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Just run it through such that the

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
alcohol passes through the pipes within

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
this thing. That just makes sure that

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
any kind of bacteria or infection which

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
is growing inside will be destroyed.

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
This honestly might be one of the best

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
$100 purchases I've ever made. If I had

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,160
this device when I was younger, 3 4

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
years ago, 5 years ago, I would have not

84
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,920
had these symptoms. I would not have had

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
to get surgery and I would be years

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,840
ahead of where I am right now. Just as a

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
good intervention can get you years

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,000
ahead, a bad intervention can actually

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
put you years behind. And that is what

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,159
happened to me. So when I first had

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
allergies back in undergraduate in

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
college, I I did the natural thing which

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
is I went to the doctor and I told him,

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
"Hey, my nose is inflamed. I can't

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
breathe. Um, what do I do?" And this is

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,440
what the doctor did. He prescribed me

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,560
something called Cinex. It's a nasal

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,799
spray. And this was the wrong thing to

99
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,720
prescribe. What Cinex is is it's a

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,640
decongestion. So you spray it into your

101
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,799
nose and immediately your congestion

102
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
vanishes like literally within 30

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
seconds. And it was a godsend because I

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
could become confident again. I could go

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,799
to the gym. I could make gains. I could

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
live my life as normal using the Cinex.

107
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
So, in the first few months, I loved it.

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
It was great. But Cinex is actually

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,519
quite a dangerous prescription. It's

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
it's quite a dangerous drug to use. And

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,920
the reason is the more you use Cinex,

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
the less effective it becomes. And

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
eventually it's going to cause your

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
turbinets and I'll explain what that is

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
to enlarge to the point at which you

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,519
need surgical intervention to remove

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
them. So everybody has turbinets.

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
Turbinets are projections which come

119
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
from the outside of your nose to the

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,600
inside. They literally look like like

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
finger projections on the inside of your

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
nose. And what they're designed to do is

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
slow down the air intake as it goes to

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,639
the lungs and also increase the humidity

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
of the air as it goes in so that when it

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
goes to the lungs it's not very dry.

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
That's what turbines are supposed to do.

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
That's why they can enlarge and reduce

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,680
in size depending on the situation,

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
depending on the humidity. But also if

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,960
inflamed, if there's a histamine

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
reaction going on, they will become

133
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,639
overenlarged. So coming back to cinex,

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,720
what sinex does is it acts on these

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,960
turbinets to reduce their size, which is

136
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
why it acts as a decongestion. You can

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
actually find out if you have enlarged

138
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,560
turbinets. Right. Now, the way you do

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,600
this, I'll show you, is take your

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,520
fingers and press it on the bone of your

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,960
nose. Like at the top, of course, the

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,160
nose has a bone. So, just feel the bone

143
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,840
go down. And as soon as the bone ends,

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,400
squeeze in. If you squeeze in and you

145
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,400
feel that one side is significantly

146
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
bumpier, like if you have some kind of a

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,520
bony um feeling like there's a bead

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,479
stuck in your nose, that's an enlarged

149
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,479
turbinet. Can happen because of many

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,880
reasons, but if you have this, you'd

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,199
want to talk to your ENT to see what can

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,600
be done about this. This is why I needed

153
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
surgery is because I overused the sinex.

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
Sinex is addictive. The doctors didn't

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,000
tell me about it. And because of the

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,560
overuse, the only option left to me was

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
surgery. In fact, I have pictures of the

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,280
surgery that I did. The before and

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
afters looks pretty messed up, but I

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
wanted to show you. So, if you look at

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,039
this, you can see after the surgery,

162
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,919
after they cut the turbanet off, there's

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,240
so much air space compared to in the

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,840
beginning. So, don't use Cinex. Sinex is

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,320
just a terrible product overall. Don't

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,240
use Afrin. Terrible product. Instead,

167
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,639
use if you have to use a product to

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
clear up your congestion, use fluonise

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,440
or just zerek tablets. Much better for

170
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,440
you than sinex orphan. If you have these

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
symptoms and you go to a doctor and he

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,880
doesn't help you, he's not able to help

173
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,800
you. I know that feeling cuz I've been

174
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,120
there. Instead of the doctor helping me

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,560
get better, he actually helped me get

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
worse. And that's the reason I'm making

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
this video and giving you all this

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
knowledge is because I want to give you

179
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
the story without the scar. Speaking of

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,960
doctors, another weakness that they have

181
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
is they're not so good at interpreting

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,639
blood work. So if you give a doctor your

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
blood work, he's just going to see if

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,840
your markers fall within the reference

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
range. If it falls within the reference

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
range, he's going to say that you're

187
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,759
good. This is not the way I see it. The

188
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,479
way I see it is blood work is a map, a

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,880
map towards optimal health, not just

190
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,880
reference ranges, not just the averages.

191
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,039
But there's problems with getting blood

192
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
work done on your own. The first is you

193
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,560
don't know what biomarkers to get.

194
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
there's literally thousands of them that

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
you can choose from. And the second is

196
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
once you get your results back, you

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
don't know what to do with it because

198
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
there's like dozens of numbers and you

199
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
don't know what the actionable steps

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
are. You don't know what the numbers

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
actually mean. And that's why I started

202
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,759
Crusade Labs. If you fill out the form

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,599
in the description, either myself or a

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
certified functional blood chemistry

205
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,599
analyst is going to speak with you, give

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,479
you guidance on what biomarkers make

207
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,639
sense for you to get and provide you

208
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,599
interpretation as well. And all this at

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,560
this time is completely for free. We

210
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,160
could talk forever about blood work, but

211
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,479
this video is not about blood work. It's

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,680
about allergies. Speaking of, turns out

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm allergic to cockroaches. So, what I

214
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,720
have in front of me is the allergy skin

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
prick test. What this test is is a

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
comprehensive test of all the allergies

217
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
that you have. The way it works is you

218
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,479
go into the lab and they will prick your

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,240
skin in a dozen spots with different

220
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,319
allergens. They have the concentrated

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
versions of each of these allergens. And

222
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,160
the way your skin reacts is going to

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
inform how allergic you are to each of

224
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
these allergen species. So if you look

225
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,080
at my report, you'll see a lot of threes

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,879
and fours. Threes and fours indicate

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,360
quite a high level of allergy. Something

228
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
like a one or two, not so much. So you

229
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,319
can see there's grasses, trees, weeds,

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,599
environmental, and molds. And in this

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
video, I'm going to talk about each of

232
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,160
these classes of allergens and how to

233
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,240
fight them. So at the end, you'll have

234
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,840
methods to destroy any of these. When

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
the allergy specialist looked at my

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,879
report, the first suggestion he made to

237
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,279
me was to change my bedding because I

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,279
was highly allergic to mites. And

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,039
there's a very good chance that you too

240
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,560
are allergic to mites. Because one of

241
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,399
the reasons why this reaction even

242
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,880
happens in the first place is to fight

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
off parasites. Mice would be one example

244
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,800
of that. Mites are these tiny insects

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,519
which like to live on fabric. Solution

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,800
number two is changing your bedding.

247
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,360
Let's draw some

248
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,600
pillows and a

249
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,959
nice bed. In terms of order of priority,

250
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
the first thing you need to change is

251
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,760
the pillow covers. Pillow covers. Think

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,160
about it. onethird of your life in bed

253
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,279
sleeping. Your face and your nose by

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,200
extension is very near near the pillows.

255
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
So if you change your pillow cover to be

256
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,279
a mightfree pillow cover, then you're

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
going to save yourself from direct

258
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,880
exposure to mites and their body parts

259
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,080
which both cause inflammation. So what

260
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,040
are these might fabrics? It's just

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,640
cotton. It's just cotton, but they weave

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,440
it extremely tightly. And what this does

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,920
it it leaves no space for these mites to

264
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,640
build their homes and live making the

265
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,800
fabric essentially might resistant. So

266
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,320
you can actually find might resistant

267
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
pillowcases. You can find might

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600
resistant pillows, might resistant

269
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
blankets, bed sheets, mattresses, and

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
comforters. All these things exist, and

271
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
I'll link to them in the description.

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Even if you change none of the bedding

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,200
and none of the fabrics, you could just

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,040
use a mightkilling detergent and wash

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,120
your bedding in that which will just

276
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
kill all the mites in the fabric. To get

277
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,880
into solution number three, we got to go

278
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,200
all the way back to the college

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
dormitories. This is when my allergies

280
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
first started in the first place. This

281
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,720
was prior to me seeing the doctor for

282
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
the first time for this purpose. What

283
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,440
was happening and I didn't know this at

284
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,160
the time was my dorm had mold growing in

285
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
it and I had an allergy towards mold.

286
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
That's what was causing the

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
inflammation, the runny nose and all the

288
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,040
symptoms that we discussed in the start.

289
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,600
So mold releases spores and these spores

290
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,680
cause allergy cause inflammation and

291
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
also have ZA which is a xenoestrogen

292
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
which reduces your testosterone. So here

293
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,519
we're essentially speaking of airborne

294
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,240
allergens from mold and this is

295
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,880
generally indoors. So just as pollen is

296
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,399
an airborne outdoor allergen, mold

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,079
spores are an indoor airborne allergen.

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,040
So how do you fight this? You need to

299
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,880
improve your indoor air quality. And the

300
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
biggest reason why most people have bad

301
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
indoor air quality is because they have

302
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,440
carpets. If you have a carpet in your

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
floor on your floor, very likely that

304
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
the indoor air quality in your living

305
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,600
space is garbage because carpets, they

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,320
are the perfect breeding ground for

307
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,480
mites, cockroaches, all kinds of pests,

308
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,720
but also release microplastics into the

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
air. So, if at all possible, you'd want

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
to get rid of carpets and move towards

311
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,800
having a tile or wooden floor. But

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,399
sometimes that's just not possible

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,399
because you live in an apartment, you

314
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
live in the dorms, and carpets are what

315
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,279
you have. So, what can you do? You can

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,160
use filters and off filters. There are

317
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,800
three kinds. The first is using a a HEPA

318
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,120
filter that you can just buy on Amazon.

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,000
And the way these things work is they

320
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,880
take in air through the sides and

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,120
release air from the top and they have a

322
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,079
filtration system on the sides.

323
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
Basically, it purifies your air. And

324
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,200
well, that's one thing you can do.

325
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
That's one clear solution. So these

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,800
things they capture dust, airborne

327
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,200
mites, captures pollen, captures mold

328
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,519
spores. We have another filter which is

329
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
a vent filter. So if you have an air

330
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,040
conditioning system in your home, you

331
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,120
have these vents in your rooms, in your

332
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
living spaces. So this is a vent and

333
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,000
there are filters which kind of go on

334
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,920
top and prevent the mold spores which

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,120
are growing in the vent system from

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,040
entering your breathing space. So that's

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
filter number two. And the third kind of

338
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,920
filter that you can use is the actual

339
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,959
HVAC filter itself. So if you live in a

340
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,600
home which has central heating, central

341
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,480
cooling, there is an HVAC system likely

342
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
in your basement. That system has a

343
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,160
filter that needs to be changed at least

344
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,760
once every month and a half. Usually

345
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,920
they suggest 3 months, but if you have

346
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,880
allergies, you would want to change it

347
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,800
at a faster cadence. Those filters look

348
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,079
kind of like a big cardboard sheet but

349
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,920
with uh perforations. So you want to

350
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,920
change your HVAC filters. That's how you

351
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480
fix your indoor air quality. And in

352
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,480
addition to this, you would want to be

353
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,440
vacuuming. That's a vacuum cleaner. You

354
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,360
want to be vacuuming your home every

355
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,880
week absolutely minimum. And another

356
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
option is just to use a

357
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,079
Swiffer. This works great as well.

358
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
Captures all the allergens. So you

359
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,000
essentially hygiene, right? Solution set

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,480
number four directly attacking the mold

361
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,160
situation. So what you can do here is

362
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
you need to actually find this stuff. So

363
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,160
sometimes it can be quite tricky cuz you

364
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,240
don't know where it grows. So the easy

365
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,800
hint is wherever there's moisture,

366
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,560
there's a chance of mold growth. So

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,279
bathrooms, kitchens, basements, attics,

368
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
high spots for mold growth. So where are

369
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,120
you looking? You're looking under the

370
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
sink. If there's wood paneling, you're

371
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
looking at the wood and you're looking

372
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,920
for green or black spots or patches. If

373
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,000
you see that, that's mold and you need

374
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
to get rid of it yesterday. I'm going to

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,279
attach some pictures of mold and

376
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
locations and I'm also going to give you

377
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,279
a kind of a guideline or places to check

378
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,880
in the description. But now, how do you

379
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,480
get rid of the mold? Here are some

380
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,839
important steps. First, if you're going

381
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
to attack the mold, you need to be

382
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,600
wearing protective equipment. You need

383
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,240
to be wearing at least an N95 mask and

384
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,880
also gloves to prevent the skin contact

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,959
with the mold. Highly important. Do not

386
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,240
skip this step. Do not clean the mold if

387
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,240
you don't have the protective gear

388
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,680
needed to do so. The second thing is you

389
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,680
need bleach. You can either get bleach

390
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,240
and you mix it in the ratio of one cup

391
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,480
per gallon and just use that to scrub

392
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,800
this mold or you can actually buy

393
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,399
specific chemicals which are designed to

394
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,320
kill mold. That's what I will actually

395
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,160
suggest. There's two two chemicals, two

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,000
sprays really, which I will put in the

397
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
description. The first one is going to

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
be designed to destroy the mold and the

399
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
second one is a sealant. So, it's going

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
to make it so that the mold does not

401
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,920
regrow. If you have a mystery allergy,

402
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
it's quite likely that it's actually

403
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,760
mold. So, if you have an allergy which

404
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
just appears out of nowhere, like you

405
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,920
feel like garbage, you feel like this

406
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,560
guy just randomly at different parts of

407
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,560
the year. It might not be pollen, not

408
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,399
might not be animals. It could be mold

409
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
because whenever there's a mold flare up

410
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,360
in your home, you're suddenly going to

411
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,279
feel like And you're going to feel

412
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,639
like it's random, but it's not random.

413
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,120
It's just that you didn't know what the

414
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,000
causing factor was. And the fifth

415
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,240
solution set is how do you prevent mold

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,320
from growing in the first place? Mold

417
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
grows great where there's high humidity.

418
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
Well, and that means that you need to

419
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
maintain or measure the humidity in your

420
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,760
home. So, there's two things which can

421
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,800
happen. One is there's too much

422
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,199
humidity. Any humidity above 60% is

423
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,079
perfect for mold growth. So, you would

424
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,040
want in this case to have a

425
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,760
dehumidifier. Very important. If you

426
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,560
happen to be living in a basement or a a

427
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,279
dank or damp location, you absolutely

428
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,199
need a dehumidifier. So, here's the

429
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,199
thing. In the winter when it gets super

430
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,680
dry, you'd want to get a humidifier. And

431
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:03,519
specifically, you want to get a cool

432
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,360
mist humidifier. and Wix makes good

433
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,519
ones. Essentially, there's two types of

434
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,959
humidifiers. The first kind is has a

435
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,920
wick and the wick basically suctions up

436
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,880
the water using osmosis, has a fan which

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,880
then produces the humidity. Don't get

438
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,440
this kind. This kind is bad because the

439
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,399
wick is usually saturated with water and

440
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,160
it can be a substrate for mold to grow

441
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,440
on. Not good. The other kind uses a

442
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,279
vibration to make the water essentially

443
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
into its gaseous form. He's looking for

444
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
cool mist vaporizer. So look for that.

445
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,639
If you do all these, you can go from

446
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,639
being this guy to being him. Before we

447
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,680
close out, I want to remind you that

448
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,040
being healthy in a sick society gives

449
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
you an unfair advantage.
