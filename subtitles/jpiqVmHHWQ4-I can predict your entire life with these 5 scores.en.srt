1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
I can predict your entire life with

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,160
these five scores. You were never taught

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,240
to understand yourself. Every device

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
comes with a manual. Every occupation

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
comes with a job description. But we

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,759
have never been taught how to understand

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,360
and use the mind that we've been given.

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
This is my biology lab where I spent

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,119
every day studying frog samples. On the

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,119
outside, I was succeeding. I was on

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,960
track to a secure career. My parents

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,560
were happy and I was literally paid to

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
study biology, which is what I was

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
passionate about. And yet, on the

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
inside, I was failing. I was lost. It

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
was about this time that I discovered

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,640
Jordan Peterson. I trusted him

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,559
immediately because of his credentials,

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
but also because he was willingly risk

20
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,800
his career for what he believed in. He

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
talked about this widely studied

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
personality model called the big five

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,239
matrix. He described how this model

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
would predict how much money you would

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
make, how long you'd live, how healthy

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,239
you'd live, and even how successful your

27
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,000
marriage would be, and what jobs you'd

28
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
be proficient at. So, when he launched

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
his Big Five personality assessment, I

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
was one of the first to purchase it. I

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
finished the assessment in about 20

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
minutes and I took it outside to read. I

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
read this test under that tree and it

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
changed my life forever. Within a week

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,799
of that test, I had quit my PhD program

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
which I had invested 3 years into. I had

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
walked into the recruiter's office and

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
began the process of enlistment. And all

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
this because of the power of that one

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
test. This is my understand assessment

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
from 6 years ago. The number that scared

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
me into action was my conscientiousness

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
score. This number meant that it would

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,960
be destined to be unfit, poor,

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
unmaraged, and basically end up a loser.

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,920
According to the psychological

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
literature, it's practically impossible

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
to change these scores. But I was

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
determined to take control of my life no

50
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
matter what it would take me. It took me

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
6 years, but I did the actions required

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,400
to change my CC score, and now I have a

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,400
personality that can effectively run a

54
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,000
business that serves hundreds. In this

55
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,240
video, I will share all that I have

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,320
learned. So, what even is personality

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,079
exactly? It's the frame of reference

58
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
with which we see the world. This is

59
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,360
what we use to categorize threats and

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,360
opportunities. People use different

61
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
words for this things like attitude or

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
mindset or character. But none of these

63
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,880
are studied. None of these have a

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,640
specific definition. And none of these

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
have predictive power. The big five

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
matrix is the only personality model

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
that has predictive power. What this

68
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
means is if you know the five numbers of

69
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
a person, you can statistically estimate

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
where they would end up. The big five

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,319
has five traits. And here are those five

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
traits. Let's start with a trait that

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
you recognize. Extraversion. We all know

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
people who walk into a classroom and

75
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
think so many opportunities, so many

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
stories that I can tell and so many

77
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,599
relationships that I can build. How many

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
people can I speak to? That would be

79
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,560
somebody high on extraversion. On the

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
other side, there's of course people who

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,440
walk into the classroom, don't really

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
want to talk to anybody. They see

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,640
threats rather than opportunities, would

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
rather go to the back of the classroom,

85
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
go to the corner, and hope nobody

86
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
interacts with them. when it comes to

87
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,879
conscientiousness. This looks like an

88
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,440
army general who's dealing with

89
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,319
logistics and personnel and deadlines

90
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,720
and enemy movements and has his handle

91
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,360
on everything despite the complexity and

92
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
has systems to make order out of the

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
chaos. That's high C. On the other side

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
of the spectrum, Los Ci, this looks like

95
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
a college student who's always missing

96
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,640
deadlines, always late to his classes,

97
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,680
finishes his assignments last minute,

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,920
studies for his exams last minute. And

99
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
that was me. That was me in grad school.

100
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,840
That was me 6 years ago. When it comes

101
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,560
to neuroticism, somebody high on

102
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
neuroticism is thinking of the in in the

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
mindset of what could go wrong, what's

104
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,480
the worst that will happen. And somebody

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
low on neuroticism is thinking well what

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
could go right? What's the best case

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
scenario? Now we jump to openness.

108
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
Openness is the trait of creativity.

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Think musicians, think artists,

110
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,239
entrepreneurs, innovators, inventors,

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
people who are interested in ideas,

112
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
abstract thoughts in the aesthetic

113
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,000
sense. These are folk who want to

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
explore new things. They're interested

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,159
in fiction. They're interested in

116
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,560
stories and movies. And on the other

117
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,440
side, we have people who are interested

118
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
in doing one thing, right? And the same

119
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,680
way every time. Think accountants,

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
bankers, think nurses who have a

121
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
checklist to follow, doctors or even

122
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
surgeons who you obviously don't want a

123
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,640
surgeon trying to be too creative. So

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,159
jobs which have a checklist and a

125
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
correct way to do things, those kind of

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
jobs would rank low on openness.

127
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Interesting things happen when you have

128
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
unique combinations of these traits. For

129
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
example, somebody like Musk who is a

130
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,799
genetic freak would be very high in

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,479
openness because he has an aesthetic

132
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
sense. He's obviously inventive and

133
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,639
creative, but he's also extremely high

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,639
on conscientiousness, which means that

135
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,360
he's able to put in the systems and of

136
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,840
course the repetitive work required to

137
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
bring his ideas into fruition. But you

138
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,120
don't need to have both of these extreme

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
traits in one person in order to

140
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
succeed. For example, Apple, one of the

141
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
most successful companies of all time,

142
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,360
was started by Steve Jobs and Steve

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
Wnjak. Steve Jobs extremely open. He was

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
very creative, had a clear sense of

145
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
aesthetics. However, he had completely

146
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
lacked conscientiousness to the point

147
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,160
that he wouldn't even shower every day.

148
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
Steve Wnak, on the other hand, very high

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
in conscientiousness, but maybe not as

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,479
creative as Steve Jobs. Together, they

151
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,160
were the powerhouse that fueled Apple in

152
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
the early days. Let's do agreeableness.

153
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Agreeableness is the trait which

154
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
measures how compassionate you are, how

155
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
well you work in teams, and how

156
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
comfortable others feel around you. On

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,880
the extreme end of agreeableness, you

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
have folk who sometimes get taken

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
advantage of. On the other side,

160
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,479
extremely low agreeableness. You have

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
folk who come off as a dick even if they

162
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,880
don't intend to. Women in general are

163
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
higher on agreeableness than men are.

164
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,919
Now, here's a very important question.

165
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
What makes it that there are five

166
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,479
traits? And who decided what the traits

167
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
would be? The answer is nobody. No

168
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
scientist decided that there would be

169
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,199
five traits. It came out of the data.

170
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
And I'm going to explain how that

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
happened. Imagine I asked you

172
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,440
descriptive questions. How often are you

173
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
happy? Rate 1 to five. How often do you

174
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
smile? Rate one to five. How often do

175
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
you wake up every day feeling energized

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
and eager to start the day? Rate one to

177
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
five. Now, here's what would happen. If

178
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,520
you answer high for question one, very

179
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,919
likely that you answer high for

180
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,600
questions two and three. Same way if you

181
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,680
answer low for question one, you

182
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,759
probably answer low for questions two

183
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
and three, which means that these

184
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
different questions are linked in some

185
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,759
way. Now, you might ask a question.

186
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,880
Well, are these really three different

187
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,880
questions or is this one question asked

188
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
three different ways? And the answer is

189
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,280
if the answers to these questions

190
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
reliably predict each other, it means

191
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,880
that these answers cluster and they

192
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,039
reliably reflect something reflect an

193
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,960
underlying reality. And they ask

194
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,600
hundreds of descriptive questions to

195
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,680
hundreds of people over many many

196
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
behavior sets. And what they found was

197
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,319
these answers do cluster and they

198
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,400
cluster in five separate clusters which

199
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
are in fact the five traits of the big

200
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,800
five matrix. This is why I trust the big

201
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,039
five matrix. It was deduced and not

202
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,800
theorized. This is unlike other

203
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,039
personality matrices like the

204
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,280
MyersBriggs test which is just made up

205
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,440
by Meyers and Briggs. They sought the

206
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
data to validate their assumptions. And

207
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,759
here's the curious part. Corporations

208
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,840
love the MyersBriggs test and they hate

209
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
the big five. And that's because the

210
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
MyersBriggs test is constructed in such

211
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
a way that it makes everybody who takes

212
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,520
the test feel like a winner. This just

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,199
does not reflect reality. We know in

214
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
that in real life they are winners and

215
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
losers. And the big five personality

216
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,919
test actually predicts this. That brings

217
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,880
us to the very curious question. Are

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,560
some personalities better than others?

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,199
And we can only answer this with

220
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,039
something to judge personalities on and

221
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
that's outcomes. Do you believe that

222
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,720
some outcomes are better than others?

223
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,199
Would you say that earning a high

224
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
income, having a stable marriage, living

225
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,759
a long life, living a healthy life,

226
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,240
would you consider these to be good

227
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
outcomes? If you do, then you're saying

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080
that you believe in good personalities

229
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
because some personalities

230
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400
mathematically are proven to have a

231
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
higher likelihood of hitting those good

232
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,039
outcomes. But not all traits work the

233
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,000
same. For example, you can have a

234
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,000
successful career on whichever end of

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
the extroversion spectrum you end up on.

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
For example, a highly extroverted person

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
would absolutely crush it on a sales

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,000
team. A salesman is expected to be

239
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
social. He's expected to meet hundreds

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,080
of people. He's expected to play well in

241
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
a team. So, he needs to be high in

242
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
extroversion. If he wasn't, then he

243
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
would be drained and exhausted at the

244
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,680
end of the day. On the other hand, a

245
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
writer would actually be better if he

246
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
was low in extraversion. Why? Because a

247
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,479
writer needs to sit down alone in a room

248
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
and work on one task for hours on end

249
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
without companionship, without social

250
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
reinforcement. So if you wanted to

251
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
succeed as a writer, you'd almost want

252
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
to be low in extraversion. And same way

253
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,800
with openness, there's no good or bad

254
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,440
when it comes to openness. On the high

255
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,959
openness side, you see high-risk,

256
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
highreward strategies. What I mean by

257
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,959
that is while musicians, artists,

258
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,360
entrepreneurs, and innovators, how many

259
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,360
of these are actually successful? Not a

260
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,920
lot. Not a lot of entrepreneurs make it.

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Not a lot of musicians make it. Very few

262
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,800
artists make their first dollar. So, but

263
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,360
the ones who do make all the money. So,

264
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,000
this is where you see winner takes all

265
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,760
type of games. On the other side, you

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
have things like accountants. You don't

267
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,440
need to be a famous accountant in order

268
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
to make money. Every accountant has a

269
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
stable career. So, the further you go on

270
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
the openness spectrum, the less stable

271
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
your career becomes, but potentially the

272
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
greater the rewards become. interesting

273
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
interplay which I hinted at before is if

274
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,240
you have high conscientiousness and high

275
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,839
openness, you can make some interesting

276
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,000
things happen. So, quick recap. Some

277
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,480
traits like extraversion and openness do

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
not confer a direct advantage one way or

279
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,760
other. They're just better for different

280
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
types of professions. Same with

281
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
agreeableness. It's hard to say that

282
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
high or low agreeableness is good or

283
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
bad. Most people would benefit by being

284
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
somewhere in the center. But with two

285
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
traits, conscientiousness and

286
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,120
neuroticism, there is actually a

287
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
direction that we want to go towards.

288
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Almost everybody benefits by being high

289
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
on conscientiousness. This is the trait

290
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
that's tied with income. On the other

291
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,720
side, everybody benefits from being

292
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,320
lower on neuroticism because being no on

293
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,320
neuroticism predicts lifetime happiness.

294
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
So, quick overview. Agreeableness,

295
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,720
extraversion and openness, it depends on

296
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
your goals. There's no good or bad trait

297
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
when it comes to this. When it comes to

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
conscientiousness and neuroticism,

299
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
however, there are clear directions that

300
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
we want to go in, which is why this

301
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
video is going to be focused on these

302
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
two traits. But before we talk about

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,640
that, we have to discuss, well, where do

304
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,120
these traits even come from? What

305
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,640
determines how you fall on these traits?

306
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
Are you just born this way? In fact,

307
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,200
scientists did twin studies which

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,720
indicate that 50% of your personality is

309
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
genetically determined. But here's the

310
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
thing, this data draws from average

311
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,040
people who are not actively trying to

312
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
seek an advantage in life, are not

313
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,959
actively trying to change to to pursue

314
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,880
goals. So what does this mean? It means

315
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,959
people like you or I who are actively

316
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
seeking to succeed in life, actively

317
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
seeking to change oursel to confer

318
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
oursel an advantage. We might be able to

319
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,200
control way more than 50%. We might be

320
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,800
able to control 75% of our personality.

321
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
The scientific literature indicates that

322
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
people have these set points which are

323
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,440
set in stone and very hard to change.

324
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,680
However, wisdom is being able to stretch

325
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,240
past these natural inclinations and

326
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,079
knowing when to stretch. So, going back,

327
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
where does this personality come from? I

328
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
already said some of it is genetic but a

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,240
huge proportion of it comes from the

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
stories we tell ourselves. And where do

331
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,440
these stories come from? These stories

332
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,959
come from our experiences. These

333
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
experiences come from the outcomes that

334
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,440
are generated by our actions. So our

335
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
actions feed outcomes, feed the

336
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
experiences, feed the stories we tell

337
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,279
ourselves and feeds our personality. But

338
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
the personality also determines what

339
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
kind of actions we take in the first

340
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
place. Which means there's this feedback

341
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,399
loop. So some people are stuck in a

342
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,959
downward spiral where their actions

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
inspire a worse personality which forces

344
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
worse actions and there are those who

345
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
are on an upward spiral whose actions

346
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,320
improve their personality and the

347
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,279
personality improves their actions and

348
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
this is why life has winners and losers

349
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,519
and the big five personality matrix

350
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,720
predicts this. My journey started when I

351
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,279
saw that my conscientiousness score was

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,839
an eight single digit. What does this

353
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,920
mean exactly? Conscientiousness score is

354
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
a metric that measures how good you are

355
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,079
at making promises to yourself and

356
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,079
actually keeping them. What this number

357
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,160
meant was that 92% of people were better

358
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,680
than me at keeping their word to

359
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
themsel. And here's what the literature

360
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,720
says. Ccore, conscientiousness score is

361
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
a better predictor of lifetime earnings,

362
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,519
which is essentially the money you make,

363
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,000
IQ, creativity, or testosterone. In

364
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,680
other words, CC score is more important

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,760
for earnings than testosterone, IQ, like

366
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,160
literally the intelligence and creative

367
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,000
ability. This score indicates that I was

368
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
not going to make it in modern society.

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Now, here's an interesting question. Why

370
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
would it be that CC score predicts

371
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,240
income even more than IQ? Well, here's

372
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
the answer. High IQ means that you can

373
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
probably make good plans, but says

374
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
nothing about how well you can follow

375
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,320
the plan. You need Ccore to actually

376
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
follow this plan. You can think of this

377
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
in terms of health. Having a diet plan,

378
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
even if it's not perfect, but actually

379
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
sticking to it is going to provide you

380
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,360
better results than having no plan or

381
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,519
having a plan and not sticking with it.

382
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399
Have you heard the saying that an insult

383
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
only stings if it's true? Well, so it

384
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
was for me. The reason why the score

385
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,920
mattered to me so much was not because

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,079
the score was low, but more so how

387
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
accurately it reflected my life. I would

388
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
always promise myself that I would get

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,639
assignments done on time, that I would

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
be on time for classes, I would be ahead

391
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,639
of time in preparations for exams, but

392
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,440
it would just never happen. I'd always

393
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,839
meet deadlines last minute because I'd

394
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
be scrolling on my phone. I would be

395
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
looking at YouTube. I'd be distracted

396
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,279
instead of actually putting the work in

397
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,880
before time. I would always promise

398
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,320
myself that I would go to the gym, that

399
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,800
I would eat right, and I would try to

400
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,880
look better, become stronger. This just

401
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,560
never happened. I had the plan. I had

402
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
the perfect gym plan. It never

403
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,480
materialized. And even when it comes to

404
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,839
diet, I had the plan, but it never

405
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,519
materialized because I would just go to

406
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,200
Chick-fil-A or Panda Express. And when

407
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
it comes to addictions, I would promise

408
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,120
myself I will no longer watch porn. I

409
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,360
will stop after this one last time. I

410
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,600
would stop wasting time on video games

411
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
after this one last session. It just

412
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,279
never happened. I would continue to do

413
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
these behaviors. And every time you make

414
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
a promise to yourself and you break this

415
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,560
promise, you are informing your brain

416
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
that you are the kind of person who

417
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,120
breaks promises to themsel which is

418
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,959
literally what is meant by low CC score.

419
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,360
So it was not the score that scared me

420
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,920
in so far as it was the fact that I put

421
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,600
a number on my bad behavior. It is

422
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
particularly important because I saw the

423
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
comparison. I saw that I was in the

424
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,480
bottom 8% of of society when it came to

425
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
keeping my word. This is a terrible

426
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,279
place to be. This does not reflect where

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,399
I wanted to be. This personality score

428
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,000
alone would make it impossible for me to

429
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,920
reach the goals that I wanted to. To be

430
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,399
clear, the personality score is

431
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,959
downstream of my actions. So, I knew

432
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,880
that if I changed my actions, I could

433
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,880
change the personality score. This would

434
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,320
essentially increase my likelihood of

435
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
being successful in the way that I

436
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
wanted. I was desperate to change

437
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,399
everything. But I couldn't seem to do

438
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,480
it. I was stuck in this feedback loop

439
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,079
which seems to be self-reinforcing. One

440
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
of the things which Peterson said stuck

441
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
out to me which was they studied the US

442
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,399
army and they found that people in the

443
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,160
US army were

444
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,199
overwhelmingly high in

445
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,120
conscientiousness. So I thought well

446
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,560
either I would want to be within that

447
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,560
group to surround myself by

448
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
conscientious people and learn from them

449
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,760
or it's the training which makes them

450
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,600
high C which means that I would go

451
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
through the training. So one of the five

452
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
reasons I joined the US army was to

453
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,920
improve what my personality was. So I

454
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
had to join the army and I have those

455
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,639
systems imposed on me in order to

456
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,040
change. So more than half a year I made

457
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,120
my bed every day. I meditated every day.

458
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
I journaled every day. I exercised every

459
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
day. And I was completely divorced from

460
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,839
the internet. No internet, no

461
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,519
stimulation whatsoever. The most

462
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,480
stimulating thing that I could do was

463
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,760
journaling. And by doing these actions,

464
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,440
unsurprisingly, there was changes in my

465
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,440
brain. Now it's true that I had no

466
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,680
choice and the systems were imposed on

467
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
me rather than me using my willpower to

468
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,360
succeed. But it didn't matter. The

469
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
systems allowed me to change my actions

470
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
and this resulted in changing of my

471
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
personality scores. In other words, you

472
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
change the inputs, you change the

473
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
outputs. But to be clear, I'm not saying

474
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,759
that you need to join the army or you

475
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
should join the army just to change your

476
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,040
personality. There are better ways to do

477
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
this. And I also mentioned that this is

478
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,720
one of the five reasons that I joined.

479
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,120
What I am saying however is you need to

480
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
take a big irreversible decision in

481
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
order to actually change your life. Now

482
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
this could be an environment change. It

483
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
could be a location change for sure, but

484
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,399
it can also be the social environment.

485
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
who you surround yourself with. It's

486
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
easy to understand this by looking at

487
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,120
animals. Take the same animal which was

488
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,120
a wishes hunter, a powerful beast of the

489
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
forest, and you put him in a zoo and he

490
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,040
can barely even breed. So the question

491
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,920
is, in what ways are you in a zoo

492
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,000
socially, informationally, and

493
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,839
locationally and try to change those,

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
you can just change one of these and see

495
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,519
a huge benefit. So here's where I

496
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
started. So what does it say about me?

497
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
It says I'm low in agreeableness, which

498
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,560
was true. I wasn't the best at working

499
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
in teams, but I was independently

500
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
minded. Relatively high in extraversion,

501
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,720
which means I could do well in groups,

502
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,160
but not to a huge extent. Very low in

503
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
conscientiousness, which was of course

504
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,319
the problem. I couldn't hold a plan. I

505
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,000
couldn't keep my own word. High in

506
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,520
openness, which means I was very

507
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
interested in the aesthetic sense and

508
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,360
creativity. In fact, I'll prove it to

509
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,120
you. Check out my jacket. There's only

510
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,120
probably one of these on the entire

511
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,640
planet. I got this custom made in Italy

512
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,039
when I went there last year. And when it

513
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,039
comes to neuroticism, I was at a 42,

514
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,720
which is not the worst because it's

515
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
below 50, but it still means that I was

516
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
in a lot of mental pain. And here's what

517
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,080
I did to change this. You already know

518
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
that I joined the army in part to change

519
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,679
my personality scores. I also worked in

520
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,440
a tech startup which sold millions of

521
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,039
units of food preservation devices

522
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,039
worldwide. Over the past 2 years, I've

523
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
made 89 videos. This is actually the

524
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,520
90th video. Each of these requires idea

525
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,679
generation, organizing these ideas in an

526
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
orderly way. It requires the actual

527
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
filming. It requires editing. It

528
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
requires publishing. It's a complex

529
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
series of steps which need to be

530
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,919
completed 90 times. But the core of all

531
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,080
this was I had to make promises to

532
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,480
myself and actually keep them not for

533
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,000
days or weeks but for months and years

534
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,160
and you can do the same and these are

535
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
the results. So I retake the test just

536
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
last year about 6 years since the

537
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
initial test and this is what the

538
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,160
results are. Agreeableness is exact same

539
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,160
number literally three both times 6

540
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,520
years apart. So what does this mean? It

541
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
means I haven't really changed that much

542
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,400
in so far as it comes to interacting

543
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,640
with others. Extraversion 60 to 63.

544
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Again, practically the same number. I'm

545
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,360
no better at handling crowds and no

546
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
worse. We leave conscientiousness for

547
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,360
suspense. Look at openness. It went from

548
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,200
89 to 98. A bump for sure, which means

549
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,960
that maybe I'm more creative and more

550
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,240
open to new ideas, more open to the

551
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
aesthetic sense. When it comes to

552
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,760
neuroticism, I went from 42 to 13. So, a

553
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,840
big dip in the average level of stress

554
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,360
that I feel on a day-by-day basis. But

555
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,200
conscientiousness, which is where the

556
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,720
biggest jump happened, I went from 8 to

557
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,120
90, which is a huge jump. In fact, you

558
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
could even argue that I haven't changed

559
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,240
that much as a person. Most of the stats

560
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,000
remain more or less the same. I just

561
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
became better at holding promises to

562
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
myself and maybe feeling a little bit

563
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
less anxious and neurotic on a

564
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,160
day-by-day basis. If you're past your

565
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,760
early 20s, the window of opportunity to

566
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
change your personality is shrinking

567
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,000
because your brain becomes less plastic

568
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,760
as you age. So now is the time that you

569
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,679
need to take this personality test. If

570
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
you don't know where you are, you cannot

571
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,960
chart the path to where you want to go.

572
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,559
So if you want to know where you are,

573
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
what's holding you back, and what you

574
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,400
need to do to succeed, you need to take

575
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,080
the big five personality test. There's a

576
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
form in the description below. If you

577
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,559
fill this and you're qualified, I will

578
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,960
pay for you to get this test done. You

579
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
probably see your peers at work. Some of

580
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,799
them, most of them even are probably

581
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,160
disorganized, not really on it, not very

582
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,160
conscientiousness, missing deadlines,

583
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,000
producing sloppy work. But at the same

584
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
time, you probably also see guys who are

585
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
locked in, who are producing highquality

586
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,240
work ahead of schedule. But overall, big

587
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
picture looking at society, it seems

588
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
that CC scores are going down. If you

589
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,160
speak to anybody in education, whether

590
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
it's in college level education or at

591
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,080
the high school level, they will all

592
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,240
unanimously tell you that something has

593
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,919
changed, especially post the pandemic.

594
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
So what does this mean? There's a golden

595
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,760
opportunity. Society will always have a

596
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
place for high C people. Either you are

597
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
a valued part of a team in a bigger

598
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,280
company or you're running your own

599
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
business. Doesn't matter. Ccore is

600
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,000
always an asset. So what does this mean

601
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
for you? It means you need to change

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
your actions. not on a short-term basis,

603
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
not for a week, but for months and

604
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,480
years, so that you can move your

605
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,640
personality scores and become the kind

606
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,039
of person who has the kind of success

607
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,760
that you want. This decade is the decade

608
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,120
of divergence. You choose whether to

609
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,640
sink or swim. Ccore acts as your life

610
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,240
raft and I'll give you more tactical

611
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,120
steps after I discuss Nore. If Ccore

612
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,280
will make you, Nore will break you. So

613
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,600
what is neuroticism exactly? It's a

614
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
level of stress you face based on the

615
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
level of threat in the environment. So,

616
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
I'll give you an example. Let's say

617
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,520
you're working for a company and there's

618
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,520
a rumor floating around of a mass

619
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,159
layoff. Should you be worried? Well,

620
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,919
maybe you should. But to what extent

621
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,000
should you be worried? That's what's

622
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,600
determined by neuroticism. Here's an

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,440
interesting thing. You don't actually

624
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
get to choose, at least on a short-term

625
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
basis, how worried you would be. Let's

626
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,039
think about the two sides of the

627
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
spectrum. On the high neuroticism side,

628
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
you might have one employee who's

629
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
absolutely freaking out, assumes that

630
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
they are going to be laid off, already

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
making a catastrophe out of this. On the

632
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,400
other side, you have the low-end guy who

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,559
sees this rumor, but doesn't care too

634
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,159
much. Either he gets laid off or he

635
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,440
doesn't. If he gets laid off, he

636
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,200
probably finds something else to do.

637
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,280
He's not going to die. So, that's why we

638
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,280
would rather be on the low side of this

639
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,039
than the high side. Like I said before,

640
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,039
none of these scores can be changed in

641
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,600
the short term. All of this only

642
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,480
responds to long-term repeated actions.

643
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,880
So, first let's clear the board. Now,

644
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
let's look at a case study of Alex

645
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,960
Eagle. Alexander Eagleman is a code name

646
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
for a member of my community who I've

647
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
been working with for past 3 months.

648
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,200
This is where he started. He started

649
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480
with low agreeableness, relatively high

650
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,640
extraversion, low conscientiousness, but

651
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
still better than where I started. Very

652
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
high in openness, which makes sense

653
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,679
because he's a creative person. He's

654
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,200
literally a documentarian, makes

655
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,799
documentaries, very high in neuroticism,

656
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,640
which means he's in a lot of mental

657
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
pain. So, what did he do different in

658
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
the past 3 months to change these

659
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,640
scores? He was almost 100% consistent

660
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
with meditation every single day,

661
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
journaling every single day, and going

662
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,919
to the gym three to four times a week.

663
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
But what does this mean in real life? It

664
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,919
meant that he was more effective at his

665
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,559
job. He needed to produce a first cut of

666
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,320
his documentary for a wealthy client. He

667
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
estimated that he would take at least a

668
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,400
month to complete this project, but he

669
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,120
actually got it done in 22 days because

670
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,799
he actually had the systems and the

671
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,640
follow through to get done. After

672
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,640
being consistent and showing his brain

673
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,720
that he was a man of his word, this is

674
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
what we saw. The first thing is a small

675
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,440
jump in agreeableness, which means that

676
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
he's probably better at working in

677
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
teams. Extraversion also a little bit of

678
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
a jump, which means that well, he's more

679
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,720
comfortable in groups of people. His

680
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,159
openness score was already high and it's

681
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,320
only higher but this makes sense because

682
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
he was a creative person who was acting

683
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
on creative impulses to create creative

684
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,159
projects. Then we come to neuroticism

685
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,240
huge decline from 98 to 24 which means

686
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,520
that he's just in a better mental space

687
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,320
overall and of course the cherry on top

688
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,000
is a massive increase in

689
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,159
conscientiousness which means that well

690
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,760
he is a man of his word. But first I

691
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,600
need to give you a disclaimer. We are

692
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,679
using the big five matrix in a way that

693
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
it is not designed to be. The big five

694
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,240
matrix is not a coaching tool, is a

695
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,760
diagnostic tool. So using it in this way

696
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,240
might lead to exaggerations. We don't

697
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,320
really know for a fact if the change in

698
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,799
conscientiousness is as big as the

699
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,280
numbers indicate. My before and after

700
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,559
has a sixear span in between. So it

701
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,720
makes sense that a big change could

702
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,640
happen. Alice Eagle's before and after

703
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,120
have only three months span between

704
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
them. Which means that again this could

705
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
be an exaggeration but what does this

706
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
mean? It means that at least he went in

707
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,600
the right direction. That is not

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,320
arguable. So if his actions changed and

709
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,320
his self-perceptions change that means

710
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,919
his personality has changed. The key

711
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
thing to remember is you got to make

712
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
promises to yourself and actually keep

713
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
them do the right actions for long

714
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,080
enough your personality changes and that

715
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
feeds future actions and that is the

716
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,919
only way you have towards the success

717
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,120
that you want. But if you feel stuck and

718
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,240
you're not able to take these small

719
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,600
actions in order to change your

720
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,679
personality, it means that you probably

721
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,960
need to take a big action. If the small

722
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,880
actions aren't doing it, you need to

723
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
take a big action. And I cannot tell you

724
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,960
what this action is. It's just a key

725
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,039
core decision that you must make and

726
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
step across Rubicon in order to change

727
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,480
your life. You can do that for yourself

728
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
or you can get my help to do so. So if

729
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,000
you think you have low C or if you think

730
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
you have high N, you need to start

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,120
working on that yesterday. Fill out the

732
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,120
form in the description below.
