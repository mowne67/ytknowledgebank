1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,880
Jeffrey's finally got a girlfriend. Oh.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Oh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Jeffrey, she's

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,839
texting other guys. You've got to

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,599
confront her about this, man. You've got

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
to go speak to her about it. Oh no.

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
Jessica's using one of the 10

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,160
manipulation tactics. Don't fall for it,

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,080
Jeffrey. Don't fall. No. It's too late.

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
He believed her. And now she's getting

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,600
pounded by one of the guys she was

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,600
texting, but she told him that he's just

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,160
a friend. Jeffrey, don't fall for these

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
tactics. Jeffrey, didn't you know that a

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,239
lot of girls these days are using these?

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
Adonis

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,239
Adonis does not fall for a puny female's

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
manipulation tactics. Now, he knows that

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
there are good women out there. One by

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
one, Adonis deflected all of the

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
manipulation tactics so that he could

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,440
find a good woman. This is how men need

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
to live today. What are the best and

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
worst manipulation tactics that women

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,640
use today? In this video, I'm going to

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,879
rank 10 of the most popular, most common

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,879
manipulation tactics that women are

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,680
using in modern dating. I'll be ranking

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
them from S tier all the way down to F

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,799
tier. And inside of this video, I'm

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,159
going to crown one of these manipulation

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,320
tactics as the best one, S plus. And I'm

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,320
also going to crown one of these as the

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
worst, most silly. Like, if you fall for

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
this, you're just an idiot. Fminus tier.

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,759
Let's start with the first manipulation

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,920
tactic. Crying. This has been a

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
manipulation tactic that women have used

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,759
for literally the existence of human

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,799
beings. And this is how it goes. She

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,759
does something to upset you. You are

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
upset. Since you're upset, she's upset

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
and now it's about her. She literally

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
will hurt you. Let's say, you know,

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
she's texting guys and you see it.

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
You're upset. Then she'll cry saying,

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
"Oh, but I've upset you and now it's

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
about her again and now you're the

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
asshole."

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
So, of course, where do you think we're

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
going to put crying in the in the rank

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
of the manipulation tiers? We're going

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,920
to put it down low. We'll give it an F

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
tier. But here's where it gets

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,360
interesting. For the second manipulation

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,200
tactic, I'm going to change it slightly.

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,000
How about crying socially? So, not just

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
crying between you and her in private,

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
but let's say she starts crying in

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
public, or let's say she starts crying

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,280
and then posting about it on social

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,720
media. Suddenly, that harmless act that

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
you could kind of look at as like the

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
act of a little girl who's trying to

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,520
make you feel bad, suddenly she's now

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
getting basically everyone on her side.

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
If you're with a girl and she starts

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,480
crying about something, okay, it's

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,120
pretty normal, fine. But if she cries

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,160
and then posts about it on social media,

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
she's going to get so much extra support

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
on her side because you as the man will

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
instantly look like the bad guy. The

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,040
same in public as well. Look, if you

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
guys are out in public and let's say

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
she's done something to upset you, but

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
then she cries in public, you look like

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,080
the [ __ ] So, I'm going to put crying

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
socially higher on the list. I'm going

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
to put it in the C tier. And I want to

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
teach you quickly how can you overcome

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
this form of manipulation. Don't take a

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
woman's tears that seriously. There's a

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
phrase which is called crocodile tears,

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
which basically means when a woman's

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
crying, but she's literally using it as

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
a form of manipulation to make you feel

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,599
bad or to get people onto her side.

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
There's an Instagram reel, I think,

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,280
maybe hopefully we can find it for you,

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
where this girl, she's like crying on

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
the phone to her partner, you know,

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
she's like arguing with him or whatever,

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,239
and her friends are like sat in bed

94
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
recording her. She's on like the

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,680
loudspeaker speaking to him, you know, I

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
can't believe you you you've hurt me

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
like this. And when she realizes her

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
friends are recording, she turns to her

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,239
friend who's recording and goes like

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
this. Like, you know, like she's like

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
laughing happy and then goes back to

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
pretending that she's crying again. And

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,640
her friends are like laughing because

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
they know that that's her personality.

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,319
And a lot of girls are like this. They

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
literally will show you what seems like

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,720
pure genuine tears, but they don't

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
actually feel that bad. They're doing it

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
to make you feel bad. The way you

110
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,120
overcome this form of manipulation is to

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
not take her tears seriously. Women cry

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
for like everything these days, bro. A

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
girl will cry because she's kind of

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
stressed. She'll cry because she's kind

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
of hungry. So then, if she cries because

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
of some [ __ ] that's happened in your

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
relationship, it doesn't mean that you

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
should actually take it more seriously.

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
You should not allow that to change your

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
perspective of anything that's happened

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,560
in your relationship. And another thing,

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
as a society worldwide, we need to do

123
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,519
this. If you see a woman crying about

124
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
her man, be aware that it could be a

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
form of manipulation. There's a

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,600
statistic that literally blows my mind.

127
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,359
You know what it is? Let's say you're in

128
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
a relationship with your girl. You're

129
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,759
both at home. If she attacks you, like

130
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
I'm talking, she literally physically

131
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,880
grabs you, scratches you, attacks you,

132
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,840
and you call the police. When the police

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,680
arrive, if she has tears on her face,

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,800
you are more likely to get arrested.

135
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,600
Even if you've got blood on you, her

136
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
tears are more believable than your

137
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,479
blood. That's a real statistic. If you

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,040
are a victim of domestic abuse, you are

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,120
more likely to get arrested yourself if

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
she is crying. Think about that for a

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
second. If you call the police, you call

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
them, you they literally heard your

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
voice, they asked your name, you call

144
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
the police saying, "Oh my god, my

145
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
girlfriend's going crazy. She's just

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
attacking me. She's grabbed a knife."

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
They'll come over. Statistically, you

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,280
are more likely to get arrested than she

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,639
is as long as she's crying. Think about

150
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
how crazy that is. Cuz when the police

151
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,919
come, they're [ __ ] idiots, right? Of

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,600
course, bro. The world is sexist, not to

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,120
women, but to men. When they come and

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
see the little girl who's crying,

155
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
they'll see you, the big aggressor, and

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
blame it on you. This is why us talking

157
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
about manipulation is so important. And

158
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
I know this seems like a goofy video,

159
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
but you're seeing my point now of like

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
this video is actually quite purposeful

161
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
for us to speak about, isn't it? Let's

162
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,360
talk about the third manipulation tactic

163
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,080
that women are using, and it is lying.

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Lying is manipulation because a woman

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
will make you believe that reality is

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
different from what it is. You don't get

167
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,039
the human right of being able to feel

168
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,639
and base your decisions on reality just

169
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,800
because she's maybe a bit embarrassed

170
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,479
about something that she's done. And the

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
reason why lying is such a powerful

172
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,039
manipulation tactic, especially when

173
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,280
women do it, is because most men do not

174
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,479
know just how much a woman would lie. If

175
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
you've ever been in the situation where

176
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,320
you've had a girl compulsively lie to

177
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,160
you, you might have like had your

178
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,560
perception of the world destroyed,

179
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,520
thinking, "I cannot believe a girl who

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,080
loves me could lie that much to me." As

181
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,720
men, our word is kind of like our bond.

182
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
It's our our honor. We say what we mean.

183
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
For girls, especially feminine girls,

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
it's not so much. And so because of

185
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
that, I'm going to put lying pretty high

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
up. I'm going to put it in the B tier.

187
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm not putting it all the way to the

188
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
top. The reason why is because feminine

189
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
women are not exactly liars. They're

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
talking about what they feel like in the

191
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
moment. The problem is most men don't

192
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,680
really relate to that at all. And so

193
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
when she tells you, no, that guy I was

194
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
texting, no, nothing's happening. I'm

195
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,720
not interested in him. The reason why

196
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
she's saying that, even though it's

197
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,600
technically not true, cuz she was

198
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
interested enough to reply to him, is

199
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
because right here, right now, when

200
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
you're in front of her, you're giving

201
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
her attention. you're confronting her,

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
she doesn't feel like she's interested

203
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
in another guy. She can say, "I love

204
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199
you." And she means it, but 10, 20

205
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,280
minutes from then when some guy from her

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
past texts her, her emotions can change

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
just like the wind and she can go from

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,880
loving you and just be only thinking

209
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,639
about you to suddenly getting a huge

210
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
surge of emotions when maybe some guy

211
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
from her past texts her or, you know,

212
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
you haven't replied to her for like an

213
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
hour or something. And so more and more

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,680
guys are kind of understanding like a

215
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,080
feminine woman is kind of like extremely

216
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,599
chaotic and untrustworthy in some ways.

217
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
And this is just the nature of a

218
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,319
feminine woman. And it's a hard thing to

219
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
deal with because you would expect

220
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
whatever a girl says to you is what she

221
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
actually means, but it's not. It's what

222
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
she feels right now, which is subject to

223
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,840
change every 2 minutes. So, we've got

224
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,560
lying for the Btier. But now, there is a

225
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,199
different form of lying, which is way

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,240
higher on the tiers of manipulation, and

227
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,400
it is something called trickle truths.

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
Trickle truths is like lying, but on

229
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,880
steroids. And this is how it works.

230
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,319
She'll tell you a part of the truth.

231
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Like she'll tell you something which is

232
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,160
in the direction of the truth, but just

233
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,160
enough to upset you, but not enough to

234
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,919
really piss you off and make you end

235
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,759
things with her. She'll tell you that

236
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
because you're close to finding out the

237
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
full truth. And hopefully she makes you

238
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,919
believe the situation wasn't as bad as

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,759
it actually was. And you can imagine the

240
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,599
number one scenario in which a woman

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
will tell you trickle truths is when she

242
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
tells you how far she went with another

243
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,240
guy that she was cheating on you with. I

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
remember last year I had a girl come

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
over to my place. I had seen her a few

246
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,240
times and she told me that she had been

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
married before, you know, this point.

248
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,199
And it was quite interesting cuz she was

249
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,479
still fairly young. She was like 28

250
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
years old. And so I asked her, "Oh,

251
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
that's crazy. You were married. Like,

252
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
you know, what happened?" And she said,

253
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,639
"Yeah, he wanted a divorce when he found

254
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,000
out that I cheated on him." And I was

255
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,680
like, "Oh, that's crazy. What did you

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
do?" And she says, "I kissed another

257
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,039
guy." And I instantly because I knew

258
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,320
about Trickle Truth, I said to her,

259
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,599
"Listen, it's me. You can tell me the

260
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,279
truth." You know, I was playing like the

261
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
sort of like cool guy. I said, "You can

262
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,480
tell me the truth. You didn't just kiss

263
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,760
that guy, did you?" And I swear to God,

264
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,760
this is what she did. And she looked

265
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,080
like she went, "No, I [ __ ] him as

266
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,000
well."

267
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Her husband, bless him, had the balls

268
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that when she told him that she just

269
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
kissed this other guy, he still wanted

270
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
to get divorced. But a lot of women will

271
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
literally go all the way like they'll

272
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
cheat. They'll get pounded maybe even

273
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
multiple times, but they'll tell their

274
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
man it was just a kiss. Oh no, no,

275
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
nothing happened. We just went on a date

276
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
but nothing happened. They'll tell you

277
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
something like, "Oh yeah, he just kissed

278
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
me." Instead of saying, "Yeah, he [ __ ]

279
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
me three times in the night." Because

280
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
they want you to just be able to get

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
kind of pissed off, but not enough that

282
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
you actually kind of, you know, sus

283
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
everything out. My first girlfriend did

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,760
this to me as well. I still remember

285
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,600
this. This is probably what made me

286
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
jaded for [ __ ] years. I went to

287
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
surprise her one day and I went over to

288
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
her uh accommodation like you know we

289
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,640
were students in university and I even

290
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
got inside of her flat like one of her

291
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
flat mates opened the door for me and I

292
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
knocked on her bedroom door and when she

293
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,560
opened she was like shocked to see me

294
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
and I literally I just knew for a fact

295
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
there was like someone hiding underneath

296
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
the bed or someone was here cuz I could

297
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,200
tell she was just like guilty. So I'm

298
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
subtly you know cuz I don't want to show

299
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,160
all my cards. I was like subtly kind of

300
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
like checking if there's any [ __ ]

301
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
guys here but there wasn't. But my gut

302
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
feeling was just there though, like she

303
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,680
could not be trusted. You know, your gut

304
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
evolutionary like animal instinct was

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,760
just telling you like some bullshit's

306
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
happening. Eventually, I noticed that

307
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
she was on her phone and she had been

308
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
texting a guy and I asked her like,

309
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,160
"Who's that?" And she said, "Oh,

310
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,600
nothing. It's just like a guy from back

311
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,600
home. He was just asking me how

312
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
university was because she had just

313
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
moved here." And I knew that she was

314
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
kind of lying about something. So, I

315
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
asked her, "Have you had sex with this

316
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
guy before?" And she said, "No. What?

317
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
No, not at all. No, it's just a friend.

318
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
He's just asking how this university

319
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,079
was. It's it there's nothing, you know,

320
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,760
we're just texting. That's it. No,

321
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,920
nothing at all. My gut instinct didn't

322
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
change. I kept on pressing her on it and

323
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
said, "No, tell me the truth. Have you

324
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
been with this guy? Like, have you

325
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
kissed him before? Have you done

326
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
anything with him? Tell me the truth."

327
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
She's like, "No, what happened? Come on,

328
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
relax. You're just getting crazy. You're

329
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,399
just, you know, you're being insecure

330
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,079
now. You're just being angry about

331
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
something, whatever." She kept that up.

332
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,079
I swear to God, this was for about an

333
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,760
entire day. I kept like, you know, it

334
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,600
felt so awkward. I was sat there

335
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
overinking. She was telling me to just

336
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
calm down, whatever. And I said to her,

337
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,839
I just gave her the ultimatum. I was

338
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
like, "Listen, I know you're lying to

339
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,880
me. If you lie one more time, I'm going

340
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,959
to walk out the door. You will never see

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,160
me again. Tell me the truth." And she

342
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,720
says, "Fine. Yeah, we used to send nudes

343
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,160
to each other." That already broke my

344
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
heart. Cuz that's cheating, right? If a

345
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
girl used to send nudes to a guy, now

346
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,399
she's texting him again whilst she's in

347
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,839
a relationship with you, that's

348
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
cheating. So my heart was already

349
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,920
broken. But the gut instinct didn't go.

350
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
So then I felt trapped, like I should

351
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
have just walked away. I should have

352
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
just ended the relationship. But it's

353
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
like I felt like this massive need to

354
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
know all the details. So I start

355
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
speaking to her more. Okay, when did

356
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
that happen? Tell me. No, you didn't

357
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,160
just send nudes. You've hooked up

358
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,680
before. You've like kissed each other

359
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
before minimum. She's like, no, no, no.

360
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
Like we've never even done it. We

361
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,519
literally just like, you know, just a

362
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
few pictures. No, it was years ago. No,

363
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,920
no, no, no. This goes on for literally

364
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
the next day. The whole day, I'm

365
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,279
literally stressed. I can't even sleep

366
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,399
properly. I'm just thinking about it. I

367
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
should have just left, of course, but

368
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
like, you know, you feel like this need

369
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
to know everything, right? And I kept on

370
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
asking, kept on asking. I'm like,

371
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
"Listen, I give another ultimatum. If

372
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
you don't tell me the truth, I'm just

373
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
gonna leave. Just tell me, please.

374
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
Please, you're you're breaking my heart.

375
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
Just tell me. Like, something's

376
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,120
happened." And she's like, "Okay, fine,

377
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,720
fine, fine, fine. We we we we had sex

378
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,240
once, but it was with a condom."

379
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,639
My heart [ __ ] tore in half,

380
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,639
bro. I named my future children with

381
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,480
this girl. I lost my virginity. Like, I

382
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
did everything with this girl. She was

383
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
my first everything, right? She says

384
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,880
that it was like another tear in my

385
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,519
little fragile heart and still the gut

386
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,040
instinct didn't go away. For days we're

387
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,560
on this like on and off kind of

388
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,399
relationship where you know I feel

389
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
terrible but when you feel terrible you

390
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
run to the person who you've got a

391
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
loving attachment with even though

392
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,800
they're the ones who who are making you

393
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
feel terrible. So it was almost like

394
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
self harm where I was like I felt [ __ ]

395
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
I felt so like hurt and I kept on

396
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
staying with this girl. Kept on asking

397
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
okay is that it? It was with a condom.

398
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
It was just once. Okay, you know but I

399
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,040
didn't really believe her. I kept on

400
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
like just thinking about it, whatever.

401
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,120
Eventually, I I was so stressed that I

402
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
literally went back home for a few days

403
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
cuz I just didn't want to be in like

404
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,680
university. I didn't want to be next to

405
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,760
her. And I remember I still remember

406
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,200
this so perfectly cuz I was 19 years

407
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,880
old. It was like December in uh 2017 or

408
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
to 2016, like my first year of

409
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
university. And I was in the my garage,

410
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,839
like, you know, back home in my family

411
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,440
home. I was in my garage where we had

412
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
like a little weightlifting setup. And I

413
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
was sat on the bench. I still had the

414
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
same gut instinct that she wasn't

415
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
telling me everything. So, we're on

416
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,480
FaceTime together, and I said to her

417
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
once again, I said, "Listen, tell me the

418
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
truth. You're still hiding something. I

419
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,000
need to know the truth. You're killing

420
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,000
me. I'm so stressed, but I need to know

421
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,760
everything. It wasn't just once, was

422
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440
it?" She's like, "No, it was like, it

423
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,839
was just the mistake. You know, it was

424
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
before I ever met you and whatever." I'm

425
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,000
like, "Just like, I don't believe you.

426
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,959
Tell me the truth." And she goes, "Okay,

427
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,959
it was lots of times."

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,639
And I said, "How many times did you use

429
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,079
a condom?" And she said, "None of them."

430
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
I still remember cuz I was on the phone

431
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,839
with her like this and I went I put the

432
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
phone like this so she couldn't see my

433
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
face. And I went

434
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
like that. Do you know that was like

435
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
cheating because she was texting a guy

436
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,440
that she had been intimate with

437
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
beforehand while she's in a committed

438
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
relationship. That's cheating. That's so

439
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,600
wrong. But the reason why this hurts so

440
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,720
much is because she just trickle truth.

441
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,720
She dropped little truths over time. She

442
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,399
like dripfed the truth. And when someone

443
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,480
does that to you, it makes you literally

444
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880
go insane because you know that if you

445
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,399
keep [ __ ] aggressively asking them,

446
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
keep asking them, keep asking them, keep

447
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
asking them, you'll get more and more of

448
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
the truth. Someone who tells you the

449
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
truth just straight up, they might have

450
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,440
hurt you. You kind of know where you

451
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
stand with them. A lot of men are like

452
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,040
that. Like this is why like like men are

453
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
often more respectful than women because

454
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,880
a lot of men, not all men, but like a

455
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,639
lot of high-standing masculine men who

456
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,320
you know they're not cowards, a woman

457
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,760
could ask him, "Have you ever cheated?"

458
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
And he'll say like, "Yes, three times."

459
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
He'll say it straight up like that. And

460
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
that that doesn't mean he's a good

461
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
person, but the very least he's not like

462
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
lying and drip feeding it and whatever.

463
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,959
When a girl does this to you, it can

464
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,880
quite literally drive you insane because

465
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,399
one, you're getting all these hurtful,

466
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
you know, realizations that she's been

467
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,079
cheating or she's been talking to this

468
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,720
guy, whatever. But two, you know that if

469
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,880
you press her hard on the issue in this

470
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,399
uncomfortable kind of conflict argument

471
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
that then you'll get more and more of

472
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
the truth. It leaves you like a

473
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,519
crackhead, like fening for the next bit

474
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,959
of truth. It's so utterly painful to be

475
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
in that situation and chances are if

476
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,839
you're watching this, you might have had

477
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,800
a time where a girl was giving you

478
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,560
trickle truths and it's so hurtful. Like

479
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,760
just asking a girl what's happened and

480
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,279
she's cheated on you. Okay, that's

481
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,120
terrible. You know, guys kill themselves

482
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
for that. But then her cheating on you,

483
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
lying about it, and then giving you

484
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,120
trickle truth. Just giving you a bit of

485
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,440
the truth over like a few days, over a

486
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,199
week. That's so painful. Like that

487
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
literally can drive you like mentally

488
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,360
insane. I probably still have like trust

489
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,040
issues. That was like, bro, that was 9

490
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
years ago. And I probably still have

491
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,120
some trust issues from that moment.

492
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,920
That's how much it can negatively impact

493
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,839
you when a woman uses trickle truths,

494
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,680
which is one of the most extreme

495
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,639
manipulation tactics. And that's why I'm

496
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,320
going to put this one in the S tier. And

497
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,320
if you're wondering, how do you beat

498
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
this? How do you overcome a woman who's

499
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
giving you trickle truths, please do

500
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
what I didn't have the courage to do,

501
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
just leave. Don't try and get to the

502
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,920
bottom of it. I know that for some

503
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,399
[ __ ] up reason, you'll want to know

504
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,399
all the details. Don't. You'll just

505
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
drive yourself insane. You'll destroy

506
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,440
her perception of you, which you know

507
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
you shouldn't care about, but still it's

508
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,279
like, bro, she'll just think of you like

509
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,279
some some crybaby little [ __ ] as well

510
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,279
who's like controlling and insecure. You

511
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,920
gain nothing from knowing all of the

512
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,680
details. The moment the bare minimum has

513
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
been hit for like a girl who's wronged

514
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,399
you, she's disrespected you, she's

515
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,079
cheated on you. Like, you know, the

516
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,600
moment I saw that she was texting a guy,

517
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,959
I should have just left the relationship

518
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
right there and then. I was literally,

519
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
bro, I was a good boy. I wanted to get

520
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
married. I wanted to be in love. I

521
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
wanted children. I'm not going to do

522
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
that with a girl who's texting other

523
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,160
guys and even has like male friends or

524
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,600
anything. And the moment I found out

525
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
that she had sent nud news to this guy,

526
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,079
even though there was so much more, I

527
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
should have just completely left the

528
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,160
situation, right? We have like this this

529
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,399
[ __ ] up thing inside of us that wants

530
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
to get all the details. We want to ask

531
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
all these specific, you know, details so

532
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
we can build up the picture in our minds

533
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
and it's bro, it's not going to help

534
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,680
you. You're not going to feel any

535
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,079
better. It's not going to like make it

536
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,319
easier to move on. The moment the bare

537
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,720
minimum has ever been hit for a girl to

538
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,799
be like ejected from your life, do it.

539
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,400
Don't stay around to argue. Don't give

540
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
her closure. Don't give yourself

541
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
closure. Ghost her from everything. And

542
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
then don't have this kind of like, you

543
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
know, annoyed feeling towards her. Have

544
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,240
this like shrugged shoulders feeling

545
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,839
which is like, "Nope, yeah, I'm not

546
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
really attracted to her anymore." That's

547
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,199
the biggest power play you can ever have

548
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,880
on a woman who wrongs you this much. The

549
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,160
biggest power play is not you arguing

550
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,679
with her. It's not you asking her for

551
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,440
all the details. It's not you trying to

552
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
convince her that she's a bad person.

553
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,919
Because those things will just make you

554
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
look bad because she'll just think, "Ah,

555
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
he's so insecure." The biggest power

556
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
play is literally you delete her from

557
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
everything, even block her so she can't

558
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,679
reach out to you. And if anyone asks, or

559
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,799
even if she asks you like, "What

560
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,000
happened?" You just shrug your shoulders

561
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,280
and say, "Ah, I'm not really attracted

562
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
to you anymore." You just say it like

563
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,360
it's a casual thing. That will hurt them

564
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,640
more than you getting in their face and

565
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
saying, "No, but you cheated." Because

566
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
you want them to admit, "Yeah, I've

567
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,039
wronged you. I'm so sorry. I should have

568
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
treated you better." But they're not

569
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
going to say that because a lot of these

570
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,039
women, the type of women who are using

571
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
this type of [ __ ] manipulation

572
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,120
tactic, they don't have the awareness to

573
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
notice value in front of them. They

574
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
don't have the awareness for that.

575
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
They're [ __ ] [ __ ] up, damaged

576
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
people who would hurt the person they

577
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,120
love this much. You're trying to

578
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
convince her that, you know, like you're

579
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,760
trying to say to her like, "Come on,

580
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
realize that you wronged me. Realize

581
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
that you hurt me." They're not going to.

582
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
And if she does, she's still going to be

583
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
laughing behind your back thinking, "Oh

584
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
yeah, he was crying about it." Whatever.

585
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,520
The biggest thing you can do, bro, just

586
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,039
[ __ ] go ghost mode. Shrug your

587
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,160
shoulders when her or her friends ask

588
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
you like, "Hey, what happened?"

589
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
Literally, just shrug your shoulders

590
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,400
like a little [ __ ] and just go, "I'm

591
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,200
not really into her anymore." That's it.

592
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,880
The next manipulation tactic is makeup

593
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,760
and filters. You know, when I was

594
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
growing up, I um the the filters that

595
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
were available for people to use was

596
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,840
like the dog filter on Snapchat. Like,

597
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
that's how old I am. So on Snapchat,

598
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,880
there was like this dog filter that

599
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
would give you like a dog nose and a dog

600
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,000
tongue and ears and it would kind of

601
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,600
like sort of um make your face look a

602
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
little bit smoother or whatever when it

603
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,240
was on your face. These days you can

604
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,000
literally use like Photoshop or these AI

605
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,919
softwares that can literally just make

606
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,080
you look hotter even not just on

607
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,760
pictures but even on videos as well. And

608
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
of course makeup has been doing this for

609
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,679
like hundreds thousands of years. It's a

610
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
form of manipulation because they don't

611
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
actually look like that. But when you

612
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,799
keep seeing someone in these Instagram

613
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
pictures or videos that they've kind of

614
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,080
magnified or you keep seeing someone

615
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,000
with makeup, your perception of them

616
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
kind of increases because they're more

617
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,120
attractive or you know they're trying to

618
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,799
be more attractive, then you're more

619
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,520
invested into them. You care about them

620
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,039
more than they actually should get from

621
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
you. I'm going to put this at quite a

622
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,799
low level of of manipulation just

623
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,720
because it's so common these days. Every

624
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,559
guy knows, oh yeah, like you know what

625
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,080
she looks like in makeup is not what she

626
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,760
looks like without makeup. And actually,

627
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
most guys are are thinking like, "Yeah,

628
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
I kind of like it when the girl's not

629
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,400
wearing much makeup at all, just because

630
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
it like it just feels more natural."

631
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
It's the same with if you see a girl

632
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,280
who's got all those heavy filters, you

633
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,799
can tell she's been using like those AI

634
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,400
software, whatever, to like change her

635
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,240
face on Instagram. It's actually a bit

636
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
unattractive and a lot of guys see right

637
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,440
through it, right? So, it's it's a weird

638
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,360
kind of form of manipulation where most

639
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
guys are not actually falling for it at

640
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,440
all. So, I'll crown this as the lowest

641
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,360
weakest version of manipulation, which

642
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,280
we'll say is the F tier. The next

643
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,840
manipulation tactic is the white dress.

644
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,240
The woman in the white dress is a term

645
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,640
that I came up with and it's referring

646
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,120
to a girl who tells you that she's a

647
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,960
good girl even though she's still a hoe.

648
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
This is probably a large part of the

649
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
female population, especially the type

650
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
of girls that you would meet. You know,

651
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
when you meet a girl who's very clearly

652
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,799
a hoe, you know where you stand. The

653
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
problem is when you meet a girl who

654
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,039
isn't very clearly a hoe and then she

655
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,120
says all the right things to you and she

656
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
tells you like, "No, I don't go out. No,

657
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't really have male friends. No,

658
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm not really texting anyone. No, I

659
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
don't like sleep around. No, I just want

660
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
a real relationship. I want to get

661
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,840
married and have children." She'll say

662
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,600
all these things which will seem so

663
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
attractive to you cuz chances are you'll

664
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,440
want a girl who's like that, but she's

665
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
still like the rest of them. When she

666
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
says, "I don't really go out," what she

667
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,600
means is, "I go out 10 times a year."

668
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
And in 20 to 30% of those times I get

669
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
pounded by someone. She's still a hoe.

670
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,840
Like she's still getting [ __ ] by like

671
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,520
two random guys per year. That's still

672
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,600
ho behavior. It's just that like, you

673
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,440
know, she probably has one proper hoe

674
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
friend that she's not as badass as. So

675
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,120
she kind of sees herself as like such a

676
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,960
highquality girl compared to her. But to

677
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,480
us, that's still ho behavior. The girl

678
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
who says, "I don't really go out. I

679
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
don't really party." Still goes probably

680
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,799
like once a month. The girl who says,

681
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,159
"Oh, I'm not really texting guys." I'm

682
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
telling you, you know this is true. If

683
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,720
you grabbed her phone and checked

684
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
Snapchat and Instagram, she would have

685
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
been texting like 20 [ __ ] guys in the

686
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,760
last month, right? She would have

687
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,600
responded to every guy who messaged her,

688
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,360
every guy who responded to her stories,

689
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
all these guys who wanted to [ __ ] her,

690
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,440
she's responding to all of them. She's

691
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,440
quite literally texting like 10, 20, 30,

692
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
40 guys every month. And these girls, if

693
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
you end up getting into a relationship

694
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
with them, I give you my word, they'll

695
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
still keep responding to all these guys

696
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
who are casually, you know, replying to

697
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
their Instagram stories or Snapchat

698
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,640
stories, which is basically a form of

699
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
cheating. So, you've got to be aware of

700
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,000
the woman who pretends she's wearing

701
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
like the white dress. It's like she's

702
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,520
wearing the mask of a good girl. And

703
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,919
this is actually a big form of

704
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,559
manipulation because more and more, mark

705
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,480
my words, girls are realizing what guys

706
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,039
like us want. You know, there's like a

707
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
very like stereotypical highvalue man

708
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,520
these days of the type of guy who's

709
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
going to the gym. He's on

710
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,559
self-improvement. He's going from

711
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
Jeffrey to Adonis. He's meditating. He's

712
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
learning about masculinity and

713
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,720
femininity. He's working hard so he can

714
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
provide. There's quite a lot of these

715
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
guys, you know, like our viewers

716
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
basically who are leveling up and we all

717
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
basically want the same kind of woman

718
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
who's very pure and she's not a

719
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
degenerate and she doesn't vape or smoke

720
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
and she doesn't have male friends and

721
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
she's not going out drinking. Well, more

722
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
and more girls are realizing this and

723
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,919
they're realizing how to trap guys like

724
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,760
us and what to say to attract a guy like

725
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
us. The problem is most of the girls who

726
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,760
are like this aren't actually like the

727
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,360
woman that you want. They're just

728
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,200
pretending to be. They've been passed

729
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
around the class in school and then

730
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
they'll say to you like, "No, I don't

731
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,159
really go out. No, I don't really party.

732
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
No, I don't hook up with guys. But she's

733
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,919
had like four hookups before. So, for

734
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,880
this reason, I'm going to put this form

735
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,120
of manipulation in the A tier. I'm going

736
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,919
to put it high up because I genuinely

737
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,679
believe most guys in the world, even our

738
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,960
boys, would actually fall for this.

739
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,720
Because, think about it. Before

740
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
self-improvement, before I got you onto

741
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,919
this path from going Jeffrey to Adonis,

742
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
you were probably struggling with

743
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,039
dating. You weren't really doing so

744
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,120
well. You didn't really have girls who

745
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,880
were like actually genuinely into you.

746
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,640
You know, you had girls who would reply

747
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
on your messages, but like not many who

748
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
were actually into you. You get on

749
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
self-improvement. You level yourself up

750
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,880
and suddenly you get more options. The

751
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,080
problem is the first girls you attract

752
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
when you're on this journey. They're

753
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,480
still kind of like blatantly hoes. They

754
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,679
smoke. They vape. They use Tik Tok.

755
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,360
Whatever. So, you don't really take

756
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
those seriously. When you get to a

757
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,559
certain point, you'll start to meet

758
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,200
girls that you'll literally say the

759
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,200
words like, "Oh my god, she's perfect.

760
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
She's an 11 out of 10. She's not covered

761
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,120
in tattoos. She doesn't vape. She

762
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,559
doesn't go out all the time and you'll

763
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
start to like delude yourself into

764
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
thinking like, "Oh my god, she's so

765
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,000
good." Just because she's better than

766
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,039
the absolute Jessica's. The problem is

767
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,400
she's still not that great. She's still

768
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,840
going to go out for her friend's

769
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
birthday party and she's still going to

770
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,679
dance on like on some [ __ ] guy's

771
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,320
groin when she goes out. She still

772
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
replies to 20 guys per month. That's

773
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,480
still ho behavior. Of course it is. Just

774
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,400
by the sheer quantity, that's like such

775
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
low quality girl behavior. The problem

776
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
is that's probably the highest quality

777
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,279
girl that's been into you. so far. So,

778
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,720
your brain starts getting all deluded to

779
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
think that she's perfect when actually,

780
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,320
bro, she's still like a 6 out of 10. So,

781
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
how do you overcome this form of

782
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,559
manipulation where a girl's pretending

783
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,039
to be a good girl to you? Never ignore

784
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,799
your gut instinct. You'll pick out some

785
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,400
things that she's mentioned. The fact

786
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
that she's not a virgin, the fact that

787
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
she's had one hookup before, the fact

788
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,320
that she says, "I don't really go out."

789
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,000
The fact that you've seen her go out to

790
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,919
clubs and parties. You've seen people

791
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,679
tag her in those kinds of environments.

792
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
You've heard of her being in a party.

793
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
You've seen her smoke before. You've

794
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,799
seen her texting other guys. You've

795
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,880
you've glanced at her phone when she

796
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,559
uses it when she's on Snapchat to see

797
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,559
that she's got like streaks with like

798
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,640
five guys and she's got like 10 unopened

799
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,720
messages from guys. Never ignore those

800
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
signs. Those are still the signs of a

801
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,880
girl who's still a hoe. She's not

802
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,799
actually a good girl. The problem is if

803
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,799
you ever confront her about this and

804
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,960
say, "Hey, you know those those things

805
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
that I've just seen, you know, you you

806
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,480
say you're a good girl, but those aren't

807
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
the traits of a good girl." She will

808
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,120
gaslight the [ __ ] out of you. She will

809
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
manipulate you and get angry at you and

810
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,880
call you insecure and say, "No, what?

811
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
You're crazy. Yeah, I'm just replying to

812
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,600
some guys. It's not that big of a deal.

813
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,039
No, it doesn't mean anything. No, it's

814
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
not." Oh, that male friend. No, he

815
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,159
wouldn't [ __ ] me given the chance. No,

816
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,600
he wouldn't. Oh, this and this and this.

817
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,159
No, it's not that bad. Whatever. You

818
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,480
don't ever actually speak to a girl

819
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
about this. Never communicate these

820
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,039
things. You know how everyone in the

821
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,400
world will tell you like, "Ah, men need

822
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
to learn how to communicate." No, no,

823
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
no, no, no. You never communicate this.

824
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,559
You never communicate that you think a

825
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,720
girl isn't high quality because it will

826
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,720
never end positively for you. She will

827
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,400
just tell everyone you're insecure cuz

828
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,760
you've hurt her feelings, right? You

829
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
never communicate this with her. You

830
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,200
just silently observe and the moment you

831
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,480
realize that she isn't your wife and

832
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
she's not the mother of your children,

833
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,760
which basically you'll realize within

834
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,039
the first conversation with these girls.

835
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,799
You have some standards and you just

836
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,720
think, "Fuck it. I only need to meet one

837
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,039
good woman in in my entire life. She

838
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
isn't it. That's it. Just leave her for

839
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,720
some other chump who's going to fall for

840
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
her lies. you don't fall for it, but

841
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,080
also don't argue with her. Don't try and

842
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,279
present all the facts and say, "No,

843
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
because if you were a really good girl,

844
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
you wouldn't have posted that kind of

845
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Instagram reel and you know, I saw you

846
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,120
were texting those guys. Who are those

847
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,480
guys?" No. Like, don't argue with her,

848
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,400
bro. Cuz she's not going to look at you

849
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,200
and be like, "Oh my god, you're so

850
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,880
right. I'm actually a hoe." Whoa. Thank

851
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,679
you. I never realized. She's not going

852
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
to say that. She's going to be like,

853
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,039
"No, I'm not. You're insecure." She's

854
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,240
going to tell everyone you're insecure,

855
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,240
you're controlling, you're weird. So,

856
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,760
just you gain nothing from trying to

857
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,279
convince her to your way of thinking.

858
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,400
The moment you see it, you you act

859
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
respectful. You're like, "Oh, one

860
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
second." And you just never speak to her

861
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,679
ever again. I've got an interesting form

862
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
of manipulation here, and we're going to

863
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,799
call it with quotes. Caught me. This is

864
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,720
specifically for the guys who are now in

865
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,000
their late 20s. Chances are most guys

866
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,200
watching this, you've not really

867
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,480
experienced this, and you're not going

868
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
to for a few years, but let me just tell

869
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,679
you, okay, this form of manipulation

870
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
we're just going to call caught me. This

871
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,039
is when you're in your late 20s and for

872
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,279
the first time in your life, you're

873
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,919
starting to date women who are in their

874
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,120
30s. The problem is a lot of women who

875
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,799
are in their 30s are bitter and

876
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,559
resentful. The reason why is because

877
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,080
when they were in their 20s they were in

878
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,679
like peak attractiveness. They were

879
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,200
getting [ __ ] by all the guys that they

880
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,960
wanted. They were enjoying themselves.

881
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,400
But as they get to 30, 31, 32, 33, 4, 5

882
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,000
years old, they're noticing that they're

883
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,640
not as attractive. They're noticing that

884
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,320
for 10 plus years, for 15 years, guys

885
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,159
have been [ __ ] them without actually

886
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,080
like taking them out on dates, whatever.

887
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,400
And so these girls, usually around the

888
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,240
time that they hit about 30 to 33, they

889
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,840
get like this sense of resentment for

890
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,279
for men being like, "Yeah, all these

891
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,640
guys, they're not real men. They don't

892
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
actually caught me. They don't take me

893
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,679
out. They're just, you know, they're

894
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,880
like fake men. They're just little boys.

895
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,960
They don't they don't want anything

896
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,320
serious." So this girl, as a form of

897
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,080
manipulation, will start getting a bit

898
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
angry towards new guys that she meets,

899
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,039
saying, "Yeah, you're not a real man

900
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,720
unless you caught me. You're not a real

901
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,000
man unless you take me out on dates."

902
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,440
The reason why this is a form of

903
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,080
manipulation is because she's already

904
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,840
[ __ ] more than 10 guys for free within

905
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,640
a few hours of meeting them in the last

906
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,039
like 10 15 years of her life. Now, she

907
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,960
wants you to put in all the extra work

908
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,960
that the previous guys in her life never

909
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,480
had to do just because she's angry at

910
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
them and she takes it out on you. If

911
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
you're watching this right now and

912
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,320
you're young, you're like a teenager, if

913
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,760
you're in your early 20s, you probably

914
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
have never experienced this before, so

915
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
you can't really relate. But I'm just

916
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,679
kind of telling you this as like

917
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,279
something you're going to experience 5

918
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,480
to 10 years from now. And if there's any

919
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,320
older guys who are watching this, like

920
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,919
late 20s or even 30s, they'll be nodding

921
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
their head thinking, "Holy [ __ ] Hamza's

922
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,480
got balls, cuz this is exactly so

923
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,399
[ __ ] true. Courting a woman basically

924
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,399
means being a gentleman, putting in

925
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,760
effort, taking her out on dates, paying

926
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,880
for the date, opening the door,

927
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
whatever." And there's nothing wrong

928
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,679
with that, by the way. I think that's an

929
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,480
awesome thing. That's what I would do as

930
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,960
well. The problem is courting a woman

931
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,080
who is in her 30s, who has given her

932
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,399
body to over 10, maybe even 20, 30 guys

933
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,159
who didn't court her. Why would you be a

934
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,640
clown? Why would you take a girl

935
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,440
seriously who's literally been [ __ ] by

936
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,520
more than 20 to 30 guys who just kind of

937
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,279
casually met her, [ __ ] her within a

938
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,039
few hours of meeting her, didn't pay for

939
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,880
anything, didn't open the doors for her,

940
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,640
didn't treat her like a lady, whatever,

941
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,559
and now she's telling you, "No, you have

942
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,399
to put in more work." Even though she's

943
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
older, she's less attractive, her value

944
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,480
has literally diminished, and now she

945
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,480
wants the highest price. It logically

946
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
makes no sense. But with a woman's kind

947
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,159
of like aggressive, bitter kind of

948
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,360
attitude. Some guys fall for it and they

949
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,799
think, "Oh, well, you know, like

950
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,919
courting and you know, being a

951
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,600
gentleman, like those are the things

952
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
I've wanted to do." Yes, sure. But

953
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,440
you've wanted to do that with like a

954
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,520
beautiful 21, 24 year old woman who's

955
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
like super happy and she's polite and

956
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,279
respectful and she hasn't had much of a

957
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,279
sexual past. You don't do that with a

958
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,720
girl who's already had her fun and now

959
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
she's realized like, yeah, like, you

960
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,240
know, she's not as attractive. Like, a

961
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
woman objectively is less attractive

962
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,159
when she's in her 30s than when she's in

963
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,640
her 20s. Now, there are exceptions to

964
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,159
the rule. There is a girl who's wasn't

965
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,840
very attractive in her 20s, but then she

966
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
had a glow up, whatever. Okay, sure. But

967
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,919
in general, for most women, they will

968
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,679
have fun in their teenage years, fun in

969
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,320
their 20s, and it's only once they hit

970
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
about 30 to 33, that's when realization

971
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,760
will hit them and think like, "Oh [ __ ]

972
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,120
like I've got to have children soon, and

973
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,399
you know, I should get married soon

974
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,600
because it's kind of embarrassing. I'm

975
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,760
still 30 and I'm still getting like

976
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,279
[ __ ] by all these random guys. Why

977
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,720
don't all any of these guys want to take

978
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
me seriously?" Well, yeah, because you

979
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,799
[ __ ] like 20 guys in the last like 5

980
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
10 years, right? And and so now, of

981
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,840
course, no guy wants to take you

982
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
seriously. Why would Why would you want

983
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,039
to go take a girl on a date that is now

984
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,960
35 years old? She's older than you. She

985
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
She might not even be fertile anymore.

986
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
She might not actually be able to have

987
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,600
kids anymore. She's got four

988
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
ex-boyfriends. One of them's in prison.

989
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
She's [ __ ] 20 to 50 guys in her life

990
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
so far. Why would you want to take this

991
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,080
girl on a proper date? Of course, you

992
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
wouldn't. But of course, this girl will

993
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,840
be angry at you and she'll say these

994
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,200
gaslighting sort of manipulation terms

995
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
of like, "Oh, yeah, but a real man

996
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
would." If you're really into the

997
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
traditional relationship, but then you'd

998
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,520
caught me like a traditional masculine

999
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
man would. And you might fall for this

1000
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,159
form of manipulation because you're

1001
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,360
thinking, "Oh, yeah, well, I am like a

1002
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,399
masculine guy, and you know, as a

1003
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,440
masculine guy, you're supposed to

1004
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,039
provide. Yeah, you're supposed to

1005
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,640
provide for a highquality woman, and

1006
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,919
these women are not high quality." Now,

1007
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,760
there are certainly high-quality women

1008
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,360
who are in their 30s, but they're all

1009
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,279
married. By nature of being a

1010
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,360
high-quality woman and also being above

1011
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,039
30, she is going to be married. Of

1012
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,039
course, she is. It's just by like the

1013
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,720
objective law of the [ __ ] world. If

1014
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,480
there is a woman who's high quality, a

1015
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,159
man is going to marry her. If you see a

1016
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
woman who's above 30 and she's not

1017
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,200
married, it's because basically men

1018
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,399
around the world have decided not to

1019
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,679
marry her. And you should probably

1020
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,720
think, "Oh, yeah, there's a reason for

1021
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,720
that." Now, of course, this girl will

1022
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
say, "No, because it was my my choice."

1023
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,840
No, it wasn't, bro. I guarantee some of

1024
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,360
the guys that she's been in love with,

1025
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,120
she would have been happy to marry them.

1026
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
Of course, just use your [ __ ] brain.

1027
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,120
used like just common sense. If she's

1028
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,039
above 30 and she's not married, it

1029
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,120
wasn't because she made the choice. It's

1030
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,200
because no man actually wanted to marry

1031
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,880
her. Of course, it was. Don't fall for

1032
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,880
the the lies of these women when they

1033
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
act like, "No, I bring all the table and

1034
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm the one who's decided to stay

1035
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,559
single." Okay. And now you're begging

1036
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,000
guys to to court you and to take you on

1037
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,440
a date. It doesn't seem to me like

1038
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
you're the one who's decided to stay

1039
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,399
single. If you're like trying to tell

1040
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,679
guys like, "Yeah, you've got to take me

1041
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,440
out on a date and stuff." No, you're

1042
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,279
just [ __ ] miserable to be around. So,

1043
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,760
I'm going to put this in the lowest

1044
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,760
category, F minus tier, because if you

1045
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,679
fall for this, you're a [ __ ] idiot.

1046
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,360
By all means, bro, courting a woman and

1047
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,640
being a gentleman is a good thing, bro.

1048
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
By all means, if you want to be like a

1049
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,200
gentleman, if you want to learn how to

1050
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,559
like, you know, go on a date where

1051
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,159
you're being so traditional and

1052
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,840
masculine and you pay for the date, you

1053
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,279
pull her chair open, you whatever. Okay,

1054
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,120
those things are sweet. But do that for

1055
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,720
a girl who deserves it. Do that for the

1056
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,240
beautiful girl that you meet who's who's

1057
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,399
similar age to you. Maybe she's younger

1058
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080
than you. She's 21 years old. Let's say

1059
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
you're 18, she's 18. She's a virgin.

1060
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,120
She's never been touched. Okay, that's a

1061
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
high quality woman. You go take her on a

1062
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,200
date, you're being lovely. You don't do

1063
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,519
that with a girl who's 30 plus, who's

1064
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,360
literally had 20 plus [ __ ] inside of

1065
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,960
her. You don't caught a girl that's had

1066
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,480
multiple hookups before. Because if

1067
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,720
she's ever had a hookup before, she's

1068
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,720
basically shown the world what the price

1069
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,000
to her body is, and it's not much. So,

1070
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,600
you're a fool. Imagine there's another

1071
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
guy who got a massive discount, and

1072
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,960
you're like, "No, I'll I'll pay full

1073
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,480
price." Like, you just be a chump,

1074
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,399
right? Imagine there's like a car shop

1075
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,640
and they've sold the same car to some

1076
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,559
guy for 10K. But then when you go to the

1077
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
same shop 10 years later, the car is

1078
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,080
older and they say, "No, 50k for you."

1079
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,279
You'd be like, "Wait, what? Why is it

1080
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
higher price? It should be literally

1081
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
lower. It's been another 5 10 years."

1082
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,080
That guy got it for 10K. It should be

1083
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
lower price now. It should be like 5K,

1084
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
right? And they're like, "No, because

1085
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,519
you should have you should have come

1086
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
earlier." You'd be like, "Okay, well,

1087
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,240
I'll just go buy a different car. Why

1088
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,679
the [ __ ] am I going like this car's old?

1089
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,519
It's it's got high mileage. Why are you

1090
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
going to charge me more for it having

1091
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,799
more mileage? That doesn't make sense."

1092
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,480
And imagine the store tries to gaslight

1093
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,240
you. Actually, a car with higher mileage

1094
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,480
is a good thing. You'd be like, "No,

1095
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,559
it's not." Objectively, that is a

1096
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
[ __ ] lie. Oh, no. No. Because we

1097
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,760
could have sold this car last year, but

1098
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,039
we just decided not to to because you

1099
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
just wanted to. We didn't even want to

1100
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,480
sell the car, actually, because I, you

1101
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,559
know, the car is like a 10 out of 10.

1102
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,080
And I am the table. What? Like, why are

1103
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,000
you [ __ ] getting weird on me, man?

1104
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,760
Like, why you spitting everywhere? Like,

1105
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
what the [ __ ] wrong with you? You made

1106
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,320
your choice. By all means, bro, be a

1107
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,080
gentleman for a woman who deserves it.

1108
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,559
But if she's had hookups before, if

1109
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,240
she's literally been [ __ ] by guys for

1110
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,840
free who didn't even take her on a date,

1111
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,919
don't be the chump who now dates her

1112
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,039
seriously. And and part of this is don't

1113
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,600
fall for the scam of the real man. These

1114
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,399
days, the term real man is used to

1115
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,399
define a guy who has no backbone, no

1116
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,240
spine, who basically treats a girl

1117
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,599
better than she's actually deserved.

1118
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,359
These women, like these girls who are

1119
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,200
resentful, bitter, they're in their 30s,

1120
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,560
they'll say like, "Ah, there's no real

1121
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,399
men." What they're saying is there's no

1122
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,639
chumps who will actually date me

1123
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,079
seriously because everyone's got some

1124
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
[ __ ] standards and they don't want to

1125
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,879
date a girl who's already ran through

1126
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
seriously. And bro, there's nothing

1127
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,359
wrong with that. These days, you get

1128
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,040
called a real man if you're a chump who

1129
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,040
courts these kinds of women. You know

1130
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,760
how there's a phrase like the nice guy.

1131
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,520
The real man is a phrase now where these

1132
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,359
girls are trying to gaslit us into

1133
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
believing that you're a real man if you

1134
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,040
like date these women. Seriously, I'm

1135
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,800
telling you, don't [ __ ] fall for it,

1136
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,159
bro. any guy who falls for this, who

1137
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,839
dates one of these women, right? By the

1138
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,200
way, if you're like 40 years old and

1139
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,480
you're dating a girl who's 33, okay,

1140
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,079
it's a bit different. But especially if

1141
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,679
you're in your like late 20s, if you're

1142
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,040
on this path, you're getting rich,

1143
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,200
you're getting jacked, and some girl

1144
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,040
who's like 35 years old, she slept with

1145
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,320
20 guys before, she slept with 40 guys

1146
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,079
before, and she's telling you like,

1147
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,280
yeah, you've got to take me out now. You

1148
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,640
should be thinking like, no, why the

1149
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,280
[ __ ] would I do that? You've slept with

1150
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,800
like 10, 15 guys who never took you out.

1151
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,480
Why would I take you out? Why are you

1152
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
saying it like this as well? So now I

1153
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,599
need to tell you something about

1154
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,359
yourself that maybe you've never really

1155
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,920
thought of and everyone is going to

1156
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,200
attack you for this. No matter how old

1157
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,520
you are, you will always be attracted to

1158
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,160
men.

1159
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,480
No matter how old you are, you will

1160
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,280
always be more attracted to women in

1161
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,880
their 20s than any other age group. When

1162
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,880
you're in your 20s, you'll want a girl

1163
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,560
who's in her 20s as well. When you're in

1164
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,400
your 30s, you'll still prefer a woman in

1165
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,160
her 20s. Your brain might have just went

1166
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,160
into like politically correct mode and

1167
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
said no because they wouldn't really be

1168
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,920
mature. I'm telling you that isn't

1169
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,240
actually your belief. Don't fall for

1170
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,160
what society has told you. That is not

1171
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,320
your belief. For men who have not been

1172
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,280
brainwashed by society, whether you're

1173
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,280
20 or 60, you would prefer being with a

1174
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,880
woman who's in her 20s. It's only these

1175
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,240
guys who are like modern-day cucks who

1176
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,839
are kind of like, "No, because she

1177
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,839
wouldn't be mature. She wouldn't have

1178
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,760
life experience." Life experience isn't

1179
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,839
attractive to men. Like it's just bro

1180
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,320
it's a masculine thing to want a woman

1181
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,920
who's pure who actually doesn't have

1182
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,320
much life experience because you want

1183
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,560
her to experience it with you guys. Like

1184
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,480
it's so weird. So many guys now like

1185
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,839
they've been lied to that they fully

1186
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
believe it where they're like no because

1187
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,760
I wouldn't want a girl who's like you

1188
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,160
know 23 years old because she's not been

1189
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,240
ran through yet. I want her to have been

1190
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,480
[ __ ] by four more guys before she gets

1191
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,640
with me. What? Stop that [ __ ] If

1192
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,960
you're in your 20s, you want a girl in

1193
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,520
her 20s. If you're in your 30s, you want

1194
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,000
a woman in her 20s. If you're in your

1195
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,000
40s, you would still want a woman in her

1196
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,359
20s. Don't fall for this [ __ ] where

1197
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
where you think like, "Oh, but you know,

1198
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,960
it feels a bit creepy." No, it's not.

1199
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,320
She's a consenting [ __ ] adult. Don't

1200
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,040
don't fall for any of this modern day

1201
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,800
[ __ ] A woman in her 20s is going to

1202
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,720
be more attractive to you even when

1203
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,119
you're 50 years old than a woman who's

1204
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,119
also 50. Don't fall for it, bro. This is

1205
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,720
completely normal and healthy. People

1206
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,320
will say like, "Oh, it's pedophilia."

1207
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,240
It's like, what? So they're saying that

1208
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,920
a woman in her 20s is still a [ __ ]

1209
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,680
child then. So they're being sexist, not

1210
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,119
me. If she's a consenting adult, if

1211
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,720
she's above the age of 18, but I'm

1212
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,320
saying like 20s because 18 is still

1213
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,400
pretty young. But let's say, okay, 22,

1214
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,720
24 years old, that is like peak

1215
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,040
attractiveness for a woman, but also she

1216
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,960
has such little like time that she's

1217
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,880
been in on Earth, which means that, bro,

1218
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,720
she's got less [ __ ] inside of her.

1219
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,640
That's attractive to guys. Don't you

1220
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,640
ever let anyone gaslight you into

1221
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,240
believing that like a girl who's older,

1222
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,680
who's [ __ ] more guys, is more

1223
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,359
attractive than when like 10 years

1224
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,880
before that point when she was like 24

1225
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,480
and she had like one boyfriend before.

1226
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,480
Don't let anyone lie to you and say

1227
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,839
this. I It sounds maybe creepy, dirty

1228
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,599
what I'm saying, but it's completely

1229
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,760
normal. It's consensual. It's like

1230
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,920
legal. It's it's absolutely like morally

1231
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,400
fine for you to be, let's say, 38 years

1232
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,079
old and to have like a 24year-old wife

1233
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,920
or girlfriend. And you would prefer your

1234
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,680
wife or girlfriend being 24 rather than

1235
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,040
click your fingers and make her 34. And

1236
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,160
the thing is, if you really ask, imagine

1237
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,680
you've got like a girl, right? Imagine

1238
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
you've got like a 35-year-old wife and

1239
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,800
you said, "Hey, if I could click my

1240
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,839
fingers and make you 24, would you want

1241
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,760
me to do it?" She'd be like, "Yeah,

1242
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,800
yeah, yeah, sure. 100%." Even she would

1243
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
agree with it as well. And she'd be

1244
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,680
like, "Yeah, I'd want to be younger as

1245
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,640
well." And you say, "But what about the

1246
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,160
life experience?" She'd be like, "No,

1247
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,359
but if you could make me younger, that'd

1248
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
be [ __ ] awesome." Women want to be

1249
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,640
younger themselves. It's only when a man

1250
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,240
has preference for a woman who hasn't

1251
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,920
been ran through that then everyone's

1252
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,440
like, "Ah, he's sexist. A he's a

1253
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,800
pedophile." I'm not telling you to go

1254
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,240
for a woman who's below the age of

1255
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,839
consent, which is pedophilia. Okay,

1256
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,320
that's that's wrong. Absolutely. You

1257
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,320
will always want a woman in her 20s,

1258
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
even if you're in your 20s, 30s, 40s,

1259
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
50s. You know, for women, it's actually

1260
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,520
not the same thing. For women in their

1261
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,440
20s, they actually prefer guys who are

1262
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,040
about 30 years old. For women in their

1263
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,040
30s, they prefer guys who are in the

1264
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,040
late 30s. For women in their 40s, they

1265
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,119
prefer a guy who's about mid-40s. For

1266
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,760
women in their 50, they prefer guys who

1267
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,160
are 40 to 50. Basically, women's age

1268
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,240
correlates to the man's age in terms of

1269
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,240
their preference, but the man's age does

1270
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,359
not correlate to the woman's age in

1271
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,200
terms of their preference. There's a

1272
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,720
study that found this, and the study

1273
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
almost like broke the internet because

1274
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
everyone was like, "Wow, all these guys

1275
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,640
are like pedophiles, whatever." Which

1276
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,560
basically got people to rate what age

1277
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,640
they found most attractive of the

1278
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,079
opposite sex based on their own age. So,

1279
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,400
imagine they they interviewed a bunch of

1280
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,079
men aged like 20 all the way to like 60

1281
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,599
and asked them, "Okay, what age of a

1282
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,520
woman is most attractive to you?" And

1283
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,280
the age consistently from guys who were

1284
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,040
20 years old to guys who were 60 years

1285
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,079
old, the age they everyone rated was

1286
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,359
like 21, 22, 21, 23, 21 all the way.

1287
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,200
Even for guys who were like 50 years

1288
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,720
old, they said like 21, which actually,

1289
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
bro, it makes sense. But for women, it

1290
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,599
wasn't the same. For women who were in

1291
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,119
their 20s, they rated a guy who was a

1292
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,320
little bit older, a little bit older, a

1293
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,400
little bit older, a little bit older,

1294
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
which makes sense, right? So you need to

1295
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,560
know, bro, this is just normal. This is

1296
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,800
how you feel. I hate the fact that

1297
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,880
people are trying to like relate this to

1298
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,880
something as extreme and as sickening as

1299
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,720
like being attracted to a child because

1300
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,560
that's [ __ ] wrong and disgusting.

1301
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,839
Also, it's sexist towards women saying

1302
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,760
that like you're comparing like a

1303
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,599
[ __ ] 24 year old woman to like a

1304
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,760
child. No, she's a [ __ ] grown adult

1305
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,079
at this point. If you're 35 years old,

1306
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
you'd still want a girl who's 24 years

1307
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,839
old. If you're 44 years old, you still

1308
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,960
want the 24 year old. don't lie and and

1309
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,960
listen to like there'll be some like

1310
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,640
cook little left-wing little [ __ ] in

1311
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
the chat below and saying like, "Oh, you

1312
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
guys are all weird. I'm 44 and I love

1313
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,119
the fact that my wife has been ran

1314
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
through." It's like, "What the fuck?"

1315
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,079
They'll be like, "I wouldn't want a

1316
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,760
24-year-old because she'd be immature.

1317
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,599
So what? You'd want a girl who's older

1318
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,200
and who has had more [ __ ] inside of

1319
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,040
her. You want her to have experience

1320
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,119
more of life without you. You know, she

1321
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,480
can gain life experience with you by her

1322
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,560
side. And that's like a beautiful

1323
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,839
masculine feeling to want. Someone needs

1324
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,480
to say this to you, bro. Men are

1325
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,160
attracted to purity and youthfulness in

1326
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,079
a woman. We aren't attracted to

1327
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,599
maturity. We're not attracted to life

1328
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,520
experience. We're not attracted to a

1329
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
woman who's already had a lot of life

1330
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,800
experience before us. We want her to

1331
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,680
have life experience and maturity. But

1332
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,520
with us, not before she meets us, right?

1333
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,599
Don't let anyone gaslight you into

1334
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,119
saying that this is wrong or it's

1335
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,560
sickening or any of this [ __ ] that

1336
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,680
people try and say. This is an

1337
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
absolutely normal, consensual, legal,

1338
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,960
completely healthy thing, which is that

1339
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,800
if you're in your 20s, you want a woman

1340
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,560
who's in her 20s. If you're in your 30s,

1341
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,760
you still want a woman who's in her 20s.

1342
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,079
The reason why it's important for this

1343
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,240
part is because when you get old enough,

1344
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,560
maybe late 20s, that's when you'll first

1345
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,240
start ending up dating some girls who

1346
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,960
are in their 30s, but never lie to

1347
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,640
yourself. Just always know you'd still

1348
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,079
prefer if she was like 24 years old.

1349
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,520
That's the brutal part of like meeting a

1350
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,880
nice girl who's like 32 because you'll

1351
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,280
just think in your mind, man, like damn,

1352
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,160
like she's probably had like [ __ ]

1353
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,280
four, five, six, eight boyfriends. She's

1354
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,440
had 10, 15 hookups. Most women who are

1355
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,520
in their 30s has quite literally slept

1356
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,280
with like 20 to 50 guys. Now, think

1357
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,760
about it. If she started having sex at

1358
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,880
17 years old, and let's say that she's

1359
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,359
34, that's 17 years. If she only had sex

1360
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,119
with two guys per year, which isn't a

1361
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,680
lot, bro. Some girls do two guys in a

1362
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,640
month, right? two guys per year. That's

1363
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,640
34 guys that she's had sex with. That's

1364
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,480
two guys per year. Even let's say if she

1365
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,240
has sex with one guy per year, which I'm

1366
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,440
telling you, bro, no girls only have sex

1367
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,119
with one guy per year. She might have

1368
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,640
had one guy for three years straight

1369
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,400
when she was in a relationship. And then

1370
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,839
she would have had one guy a month, she

1371
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,359
would have had like four guys in 3

1372
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,960
months, right? So, but even if it was

1373
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,200
minimum, one guy per year, and she she's

1374
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,160
been having sex from 17 now to 34.

1375
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,520
That's 17 guys that she's had inside of

1376
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,040
her. A lot of those guys wouldn't have

1377
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,480
just been just one time, you know, 1

1378
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,880
hour little [ __ ] It would have been

1379
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,400
like a thousand sexual sessions with one

1380
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,960
guy. It would have been 300 getting

1381
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,119
pounded by the same guy. It's a lot,

1382
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,200
right? We are not attracted to a woman

1383
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,040
who's already had all these experiences.

1384
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,280
And it's time someone actually says this

1385
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,520
and normalizes it. We are attracted to a

1386
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,760
woman who hasn't had that much life

1387
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,079
experience before us and then she gets

1388
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,000
it with us. That's what's attractive to

1389
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,240
men. And don't you let any of these

1390
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,920
modern-day little woke leftist weirdos

1391
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,920
try and convince you otherwise. These

1392
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,079
little cuck Jeffies, don't let them

1393
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,920
convince you otherwise. So, this form of

1394
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,359
manipulation, which is from the older

1395
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,520
women telling you to date them

1396
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,760
seriously, caught me. Or another phrase

1397
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,599
for this same one could be be a real

1398
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
man, which basically means to take these

1399
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,200
girls seriously who have already been

1400
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,800
ran through. They're past their peak

1401
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,400
even though you're not. The only reason

1402
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
why you'd fall for this manipulation

1403
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,560
tactic is because you started to believe

1404
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,640
the lies of like modern-day society,

1405
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,280
which tells you that like, yeah, your

1406
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,200
desire of a woman who hasn't had that

1407
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,520
much [ __ ] inside of her is wrong and

1408
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,280
it's evil. No, it's just completely

1409
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,599
normal and healthy. If you just listen

1410
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,119
to your own gut instinct, you won't fall

1411
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,400
for this manipulation tactic. If you

1412
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,720
fall for this, if you meet a girl who

1413
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,200
you can tell is 33 years old, she's had

1414
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,560
sex with 15 to 30 guys before, and she

1415
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,839
tells you like, "No, you've got to

1416
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,440
caught me. you've got to take me out on

1417
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,200
dates, but you can just tell that she's

1418
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,960
had hookups with guys before. So, she's

1419
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,119
making you kind of invest more than she

1420
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,400
did those guys and you actually do it

1421
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,160
and you actually date this girl

1422
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,839
seriously, then bro, it's like, come on,

1423
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,000
that's pure Jeffrey level. So, we're

1424
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,079
putting this at F minus. The next

1425
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,720
manipulation tactic that a lot of women

1426
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,200
and even society uses against men is

1427
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,280
another quote, you're controlling. This

1428
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,359
often happens when a guy is establishing

1429
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,040
some pretty healthy boundaries. Like for

1430
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,240
example, you don't want your girl to go

1431
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,319
in an environment which is absolutely

1432
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,920
obsessed with sex. Like for example,

1433
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,680
parties and nightclubs. You don't want

1434
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,200
your girl to post her body on social

1435
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,839
media. In other words, you just don't

1436
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,319
want your girl to act like she's single.

1437
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,839
Women these days use this manipulation

1438
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,280
tactic all the time where they'll look

1439
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,520
you in the eyes and say, "Well, you're

1440
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,040
controlling. You're insecure." The truth

1441
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,800
is, you're not. You're establishing

1442
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,720
healthy boundaries. A lot of girls talk

1443
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,319
about boundaries these days, but when a

1444
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,599
man establishes the boundaries, he's

1445
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,359
seen as controlling. When a woman

1446
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,520
establishes the boundaries, she's seen

1447
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,200
as like a boss girl, you go girl kind of

1448
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,800
mindset. But you're allowed to have your

1449
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,240
own boundaries and values, too. And if

1450
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,440
you don't want a girl to go out, that's

1451
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,960
not controlling. That's just you saying,

1452
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,240
"Hey, I don't want to date the kind of

1453
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,839
girl who does that because it's not

1454
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,760
attractive to me." But then when she

1455
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,359
says you're controlling, it's a form of

1456
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,359
manipulation because it can kind of

1457
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,440
cause doubt inside of you to think,

1458
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,520
wait, like, is this too far? What's the

1459
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,800
way to navigate this situation? And the

1460
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,720
thing is, the way to navigate the

1461
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,079
situation is exactly what you did, which

1462
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,680
is establish some boundaries. Say,

1463
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,440
"Okay, well, I don't want to date a girl

1464
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,880
who goes out to clubs, who's got male

1465
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,560
friends, who's got all this stuff." The

1466
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,240
problem is, most girls are just so

1467
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,440
emotionally immature that when you've

1468
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,960
established some healthy boundaries,

1469
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,640
they'll just attack you for it. Their

1470
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,160
friends will attack you for it. I had an

1471
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,240
ex-girlfriend who still wanted to keep

1472
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,760
going to parties and stuff where guys

1473
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,280
would try and hook up with her. And when

1474
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,720
I told her like, "That's not okay. You

1475
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,160
know, it's boundaries. You shouldn't be

1476
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,079
acting like you're single." She started

1477
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,520
calling me controlling and told everyone

1478
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,359
as well. And you know, like it kind of

1479
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,720
feels bad when when everyone in the

1480
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,319
social circle thinks that you're like

1481
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,560
some controlling guy, but it's still,

1482
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,319
bro, never back down. Your gut instinct

1483
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,319
will always tell you the truth. You

1484
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,240
don't want to be dating a girl who goes

1485
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,079
out to these environments and and who

1486
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,599
you even have to control. So, I'm going

1487
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,280
to put this form of manipulation when a

1488
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,119
girl calls you controlling around the

1489
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,160
middle, like Ctier. And the way to

1490
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,040
overcome this is don't actually even try

1491
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,400
to like establish this boundary. You

1492
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,000
know, like if a girl is going out and

1493
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,839
you don't want her to, you shouldn't try

1494
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,160
and change her. You should meet a girl

1495
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,680
who already fits in your boundaries and

1496
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,520
values. If you meet a girl who's

1497
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,520
awesome, let's be honest, she's not, but

1498
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
she goes out to these parties and clubs,

1499
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
then she's not awesome. And if you have

1500
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,400
to try and change her, it means that

1501
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,240
she's not good enough. Then you should

1502
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,200
just leave the situation as it is. You

1503
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,319
should just leave this girl. You should

1504
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,359
just think, yeah, like, bro, she's not a

1505
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,640
girlfriend. She's not a wife. Your

1506
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,560
wife's not going out partying and

1507
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,079
dancing and grinding on guys and smoking

1508
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,520
weed with them or some [ __ ] Your wife

1509
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,359
isn't doing that [ __ ] It's not about

1510
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,359
establishing boundaries. It's about

1511
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,640
establishing that you've got balls and

1512
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,319
then ending it with the girl. If you

1513
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,839
have to establish boundaries like this,

1514
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,200
you should just end it instead. If you

1515
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,119
have to try and convince your girl like

1516
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,800
please don't go out to the place where a

1517
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,359
lot of cheating happens where you know

1518
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,040
like like single people go, degenerate,

1519
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,720
not even single, but just degenerate

1520
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,880
people go, right? Like like clubs and

1521
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,040
parties are for [ __ ] degen people.

1522
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,400
Like actually degenerate little soulless

1523
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,680
people, right? So if your girl's going

1524
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
out, you shouldn't be trying to convince

1525
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,480
her to stop going to establish your

1526
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,720
boundaries. you should just end things

1527
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,359
with her. The next manipulation tactic,

1528
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,040
another quote, "He's just a friend."

1529
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,640
This is when you catch a girl texting

1530
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
other guys and she tells you like, "No,

1531
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,119
he's just the friend. No, he's just

1532
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,800
like, you know, he's the only friend

1533
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,160
I've got. No, no, no, no, he no,

1534
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,280
nothing's happened between us. No,

1535
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,720
nothing would happen. No, he wouldn't

1536
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,319
[ __ ] me. No, no, no. We're just

1537
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,400
friends." This is such a common

1538
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,880
manipulation tactic cuz women of today,

1539
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,760
they crave validation and attention like

1540
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,000
no other. And so they are accepting

1541
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,920
messages and advances from all kinds of

1542
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,440
guys and they delude themselves into

1543
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,200
thinking that the guy who texts them

1544
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,960
who's a bit of a beta male [ __ ] who you

1545
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,280
know who's hasn't really put like his

1546
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,280
sort of intention across they start to

1547
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,359
believe that this guy is like actually

1548
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,800
you know just a friend whatever. And the

1549
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,280
reason why this is like a form of

1550
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,119
manipulation is because she would

1551
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,440
actually get [ __ ] by this guy more

1552
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,119
often than not. The guy would [ __ ] her

1553
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,119
given the chance more often than not.

1554
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,720
But when she says he's just a friend, it

1555
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,000
basically diffuses the situation and

1556
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,359
makes you look like an [ __ ] Because

1557
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,880
then it's the same thing about being

1558
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,480
controlling or insecure, which is like,

1559
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,920
okay, well, is she not allowed to have

1560
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,280
friends? And then it puts you in this

1561
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,720
kind of awkward state where you're like,

1562
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,079
well, yeah, but like, no, but with a

1563
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,119
guy, it's it's not the same thing. You

1564
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
know, if he would [ __ ] you, then it's

1565
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,520
not really friendship, but he hasn't

1566
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,640
tried to [ __ ] you. So, it puts you in

1567
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,160
this kind of like, you know, mental

1568
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,920
overthinking bandwidth thing, which

1569
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,760
fries your brain and you know that it's

1570
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,079
wrong. There's a reason why it feels bad

1571
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,599
when you see her texting guys. If you

1572
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,280
see her texting some girl and you don't

1573
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,720
feel anything about it. If imagine she's

1574
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
hanging out with her female friend. No,

1575
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,079
there's no guys. You don't get a gut

1576
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,680
instinct that anything's wrong. If she's

1577
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,880
the friend is like a good person as

1578
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,319
well. It's not that you've got a problem

1579
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,680
with her having friends. It's that

1580
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,760
you've got a problem with her having

1581
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,520
friends of the opposite sex because it's

1582
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,599
unnatural. A lot of people, men and

1583
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,359
women these days, like to act so

1584
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,839
confident by saying like, "Oh, well, I'm

1585
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,440
so secure. My partner can have friends.

1586
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,960
You know, you guys are all insecure."

1587
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,520
They're cucks. Like, you know, the the

1588
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,760
the chair in the the corner of the hotel

1589
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,359
room, those people sit on that chair and

1590
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,800
watch their wife get pounded. The guy

1591
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,720
who looks at us and says like, "Oh, you

1592
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
guys are all insecure. My wife's got

1593
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,000
lots of male friends." Yeah. She's going

1594
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,440
to cheat with one of them. Think about

1595
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,960
it. When a woman cheats, she doesn't

1596
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,400
just like walk through the street, see a

1597
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,920
guy who's hot, and quickly get [ __ ] by

1598
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,720
him like in the alleyway. No, no, it's

1599
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,640
not like random. A woman always cheats

1600
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,720
with the guy that she's already speaking

1601
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,319
to while she's in the relationship,

1602
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,880
right? Like women especially, they don't

1603
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,160
cheat spontaneously like a man cheats. A

1604
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,599
man will cheat just given the chance.

1605
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,680
Like if he's, you know, he's um doing

1606
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,880
some work event in a hotel and he walks

1607
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,160
through the corridor and just happens to

1608
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,760
make eye contact with a girl, he'd [ __ ]

1609
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,520
her right away. Okay, sweet. But the

1610
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,119
girl cheats with the guy that she's

1611
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,520
already been building up a bit of an

1612
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,200
emotional connection with. 99 times out

1613
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,280
of 100, if your girl is going to cheat

1614
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,480
with you, it's with a guy she's already

1615
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,559
texting. If that's so likely, then a

1616
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,640
girl texting guys, it's not just a red

1617
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,200
flag, cuz a red flag is an indicator of

1618
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,400
danger. It is the danger. I am not in

1619
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,079
danger, Skylar. I am the danger. She's

1620
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,160
quite literally stringing these guys

1621
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,760
along. And a lot of these guys literally

1622
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,839
believe that they're close to [ __ ]

1623
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,040
her and they will do when they want to.

1624
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,319
Like, think about it. Another guy's

1625
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,559
thinking about your girl, thinking, "Oh

1626
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,079
yeah, she text me every day. He would

1627
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,000
[ __ ] her." Like the situation to think

1628
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,839
about in your mind is imagine she and

1629
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,280
the guy that she's texting go on a night

1630
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,119
out together and they drink. And imagine

1631
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,559
they just end up back at either one of

1632
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,760
their places, but they're friends.

1633
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,280
Imagine if your girl starts flirting

1634
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,640
with him, takes her clothes off, bends

1635
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,800
over, looks back at him, and says,

1636
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,240
"Please [ __ ] me. I'm so horny." Do you

1637
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,520
really think that guy's not going to

1638
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,480
just pull his pants down and [ __ ] her?

1639
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,160
Do you really think that guy's going to

1640
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,000
be like, "But wait, what about our

1641
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,440
friendship?" No. He doesn't give a [ __ ]

1642
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,640
about their friendship. He would do it

1643
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,559
casually, just thinking, "Oh, yeah.

1644
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,839
Well, even if we uh, you know, stay

1645
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,280
friends, this is pretty [ __ ] awesome.

1646
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,559
I get to have my friends with benefits

1647
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,720
with this girl now. I've wanted to [ __ ]

1648
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,280
her for so long. Every male friend a

1649
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,720
girl has would absolutely do that. And a

1650
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,400
lot of these girls will try and gaslight

1651
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,160
you and say, "No, he's been my friend

1652
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,079
for ages." He'd still [ __ ] her given the

1653
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,240
chance. No, he's got a girlfriend. He'd

1654
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,920
still [ __ ] her given the [ __ ] chance.

1655
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,359
Don't you ever fall for this [ __ ]

1656
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,200
where a girl will look to you and say

1657
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,880
like, "Oh, well, you know, he's just a

1658
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,640
friend and and it's, you know, it's

1659
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,319
fine. It's not cheating. You're just

1660
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,000
insecure." Whatever. Don't fall for it.

1661
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,599
A woman speaking to other men while

1662
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,920
she's in a relationship with you, it's

1663
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,599
wrong and it's disrespectful. It's

1664
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,520
completely disrespectful for you because

1665
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,280
a woman who respects you will not be

1666
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,359
texting other guys. The moment you see

1667
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
her texting any other guys, you should

1668
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,640
just end things right away. Not just

1669
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,839
because it's a sign of cheating, but

1670
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,680
also because it just shows you that

1671
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,119
she's like a disrespectful person. Her

1672
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
mother's probably a [ __ ] [ __ ] as

1673
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,319
well. Her dad's probably a little [ __ ]

1674
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,839
and she thinks that this is okay. She

1675
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,839
comes from a household where it's okay

1676
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,839
to be talking to like other guys and

1677
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,280
basically stringing along options. But

1678
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,720
if you were doing it, she would attack

1679
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,640
you and gaslight you. So basically,

1680
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,640
she's just like a [ __ ] low tier,

1681
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,160
horrible little human being. This is a

1682
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,839
big form of manipulation because look,

1683
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,119
again, a lot of guys go crazy about

1684
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,880
this. You know, I'm telling you, okay,

1685
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,240
leave a girl who's doing this. But the

1686
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,839
chances are if you're watching this and

1687
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,119
your girlfriend's been texting guys, you

1688
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,960
won't have the balls to leave her

1689
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,800
because it doesn't feel quite serious

1690
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,119
enough. Nothing's really happened just

1691
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,880
yet. You kind of believe her and it's

1692
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,559
all this vague thing of like they

1693
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,839
probably would [ __ ] her given the

1694
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,040
chance, but they haven't already. And I

1695
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,040
just I just don't know. when she

1696
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,400
promises me so so hard that nothing's

1697
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,599
going to happen or whatever. If I tell

1698
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,960
you you should leave a girl like this,

1699
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,240
you probably won't. And this is why it's

1700
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,680
a big form of manipulation. Because

1701
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,200
look, if she told you the truth, which

1702
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,720
was, "Oh yeah, I'm just stringing him

1703
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,920
along. In cases you mess up, I'll

1704
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,280
probably go [ __ ] one of these guys I'm

1705
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,440
texting." That's the truth. That's

1706
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,280
literally objectively, by the law of

1707
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,720
probability, the truth. When girls are

1708
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,400
texting their guy friends, they are

1709
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,160
literally stringing them along because

1710
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,920
they'll go and sleep with one of them

1711
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,319
after they've ended the relationship

1712
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,160
with you. That literally objectively is

1713
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,160
what happens more often than not. the

1714
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,839
guy that she goes to right after your

1715
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,119
relationship ends or even before your

1716
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,880
relationship ends, like she's cheating

1717
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,559
basically, is a guy she's already

1718
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,160
texting. If she looked you in the eyes

1719
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,599
and told you the truth, like, "Oh yeah,

1720
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,440
one of these guys I'll probably [ __ ]

1721
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,960
after me and you split up." You'd be

1722
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,559
thinking, "Okay, well that's literally

1723
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,079
cheating then. You're entertaining the

1724
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,160
conversation." You'd end. It's a form of

1725
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,640
manipulation cuz she's like, "What? No.

1726
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,400
No, I'm not. No, he's just a friend. No,

1727
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,160
we just text casually. That's

1728
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,599
disgusting, bro. I remember I was dating

1729
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,119
a girl who I was surprised, right?

1730
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,800
because she seemed like a good quality

1731
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,920
woman to me. It was like that case of

1732
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,319
like you know the woman in the white

1733
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,920
dress and she went on Snapchat once and

1734
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,240
I was like what you have Snapchat?

1735
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,000
You're like 25 20 something years old. I

1736
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,079
was just disgusted by it right away but

1737
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,839
instantly I felt bad cuz I was like oh

1738
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,119
man I'm probably going to have to break

1739
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,800
up with her the moment I saw that she

1740
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,480
had Snapchat cuz I was like I guarantee

1741
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,680
this [ __ ] is [ __ ] texting guys. I

1742
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,200
just knew it. Any girl who's got

1743
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,559
Snapchat, especially when they're in

1744
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,559
their 20ies as well, you know, if you're

1745
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,920
like 16 years old watching this and your

1746
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,520
girlfriend's 16, she's got Snapchat.

1747
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,880
Okay, fine. But if you're in your mid20s

1748
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,400
and you're a [ __ ] grown adult and

1749
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,920
you're still using Snapchat, it's just

1750
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,119
[ __ ] embarrassing. And so I saw her

1751
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,400
on her phone. I was like, "Let me see

1752
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
who you've been speaking to." And she

1753
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,520
showed me and she had multiple guys she

1754
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,760
had a streak with. And I was like,

1755
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,440
"That's [ __ ] haram." Like that's

1756
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,400
disgusting. And she was like, "No, but

1757
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,359
they're just friends." I was like, I

1758
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,040
didn't even want to hear it. I was just

1759
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,400
like, "But you're texting other guys.

1760
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
That's cheating." She's like, "No, it's

1761
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,800
not cheating. It's not." I was like,

1762
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,319
"No, but it is to me." And she kind of

1763
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,440
went silent and and you know, it was

1764
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,559
later on she actually said to me like,

1765
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,240
"Yeah, I should have known that you're

1766
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
the type of guy who it would have been

1767
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,880
seen as cheating with." Basically, what

1768
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,880
she was saying is, "I should have known

1769
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,480
you've got a pair of balls." Unlike most

1770
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,760
of the men in the world, most men would

1771
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,119
have been fine with it. I should have

1772
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,400
known that you wouldn't because I ended

1773
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,680
with her and it's like she's she's

1774
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,960
wanted to get back with me since that

1775
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,400
point. And it's like, yeah, I stood up

1776
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,480
for my [ __ ] self. Of course I did,

1777
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,920
bro. It's not even about if she's

1778
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,520
cheated with them or not, or if she's

1779
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,680
going to. Just the fact that she's

1780
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,000
texting other guys does not make me feel

1781
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,599
good. If a girl makes me not feel good,

1782
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,440
I'll end with her. Bro, you've got to

1783
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,880
have like this big G, like this big dick

1784
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,880
personality to be thinking, yeah, like,

1785
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,559
bro, I'm a [ __ ] like I'm I'm gonna

1786
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,079
have [ __ ] standards for myself. And

1787
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,599
if a girl does something that makes me

1788
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,359
feel horrible, I'm just going to remove

1789
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,559
her from my [ __ ] life. It's her loss.

1790
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,920
Right. For you, you should be nodding

1791
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,520
your head with like a sense of ego being

1792
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,880
like, "Yeah, I'm a [ __ ] future

1793
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,839
millionaire. I'm going to have a 10 out

1794
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,960
of 10 physique. I'm going to be like

1795
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,400
Adonis. I'm going to be like the

1796
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,079
ultimate man in the [ __ ] world. I

1797
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,079
already have that [ __ ] I'm a [ __ ]

1798
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,520
28-year-old millionaire kickboxer,

1799
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,960
bodybuilder. I'm a [ __ ] leader of

1800
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,280
millions of guys. If this [ __ ] isn't

1801
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,200
going to show me the utmost 10 out of 10

1802
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,480
absolute respect, she can go get [ __ ]

1803
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,079
and go choose one of these male friends

1804
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,400
to go hang out with in his [ __ ] like

1805
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,240
2K a month [ __ ] little shitty home or

1806
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,079
something. That's fine. Go [ __ ] yourself

1807
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,400
then. If I want 10 out of 10 respect

1808
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,319
from the woman who's in my life or not

1809
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
at all. If she wants to go text other

1810
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,720
[ __ ] guys like a little stupid little

1811
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,319
child like on Snapchat, she can go get

1812
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,839
[ __ ] by them. I don't give a [ __ ] I

1813
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,280
do. I look like a [ __ ] little [ __ ]

1814
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,480
to you that I'd be fine with that

1815
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,920
saying, "Oh, but she's it's just

1816
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,359
friends, whatever." No. So, you better

1817
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,720
[ __ ] act like this as well. You need

1818
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,240
a bit more of this aggressive energy,

1819
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,920
not not to her, but just to yourself to

1820
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,160
be like, "Yeah, bro. If a girl is

1821
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,079
texting other guys, she is a

1822
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,359
disrespectful little hoe." And you end

1823
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,040
with her because you've got some

1824
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,079
standards. And you don't end, oh, oh,

1825
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,440
you're texting guys. You shouldn't be

1826
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,400
texting. You don't try and convince her.

1827
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,839
You just shrug your shoulders and say,

1828
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,599
"Ah, you're not very attractive to me

1829
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,680
anymore." That's what hurts them more.

1830
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,200
This form of manipulation, I'm going to

1831
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,119
put it in like [ __ ] low down, maybe

1832
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,720
like Etier, because if you fall for

1833
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,319
this, you're a bit of a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1834
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,920
which many of us are. I've I've been

1835
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,520
there as well when you kind of accept

1836
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,359
the fact when the girl says it's a male

1837
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,839
friend, whatever. Never again. Never

1838
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,000
again. The moment you see a male name on

1839
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,160
her contact list, on her [ __ ]

1840
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,920
WhatsApp, Instagram, the moment you see

1841
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,680
her texting guys, the moment you see her

1842
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,000
liking a guy's picture, you're not

1843
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,720
insecure. You've just got two testicles.

1844
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,480
In the world of one bald men, you've got

1845
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,799
two balls. That's it. In the world of

1846
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,839
[ __ ] Cuck Jeff, you're an Adonis. Of

1847
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,720
course, your standards are going to be

1848
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,240
different. Everyone else will be like,

1849
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,920
"Wait, what? You're getting pissed off

1850
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,839
that she liked a guy's picture. Yes,

1851
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,359
because I'm not a cuck. I don't sit in

1852
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,280
that chair in the [ __ ] corner of the

1853
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,799
room. I'm not a cuck, little Jeffrey.

1854
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,640
And neither are you, right? So, don't

1855
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,640
let anyone tell you like, "What are you

1856
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,400
insecure, bro?" Bro, let them call us

1857
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,480
insecure. We don't want to watch our

1858
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,079
girl get [ __ ] by another guy. I'd

1859
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,520
rather be insecure than be a [ __ ]

1860
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,280
cuck. Right? So, [ __ ] these little

1861
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,040
Jeffries. [ __ ] these cucks. [ __ ] these

1862
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,640
hoes. [ __ ] all the [ __ ] all the

1863
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,880
modernday guys who will try and say to

1864
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,799
you like, "Oh, I'm so secure, bro. I'm

1865
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,240
so secure. I don't mind if other guys

1866
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
are flirting with my girl. It's like,

1867
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,599
"Okay, go sit in the [ __ ] corner

1868
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,040
then, you disgusting little weirdo."

1869
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,680
Good girls do not have male friends. You

1870
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,920
will never ever take a girl seriously

1871
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,240
who has a male friend ever again in your

1872
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,000
life. You are not a cuck. You are not a

1873
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,160
Jeffrey. I have put you on this path to

1874
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,920
becoming more like Adonis. You have two

1875
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,920
balls. Whenever you're in doubt, if you

1876
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,920
ever get into this kind of situation,

1877
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,079
just take your hand like this, grab your

1878
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,839
balls, and just count. If there's two

1879
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,280
there, understand that you're not okay

1880
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,799
with your girl having male friends.

1881
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,799
You're not okay with her dangling a

1882
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,720
crumb of [ __ ] to these guys who are

1883
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,200
your competition. A relationship is like

1884
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,799
a castle. You're the king of the castle.

1885
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,559
And outside of the castle is the

1886
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,839
barbarians who are laying siege. Like,

1887
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,440
they'll just sit outside of the castle

1888
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,440
and try and wait you out. And what you

1889
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,119
want is your queen to be on your side

1890
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,040
for you to strategize has to get rid of

1891
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,119
those [ __ ] bastards out there. Most

1892
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,960
modern-day women, they'll stand on the

1893
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,559
walls of the castle and tease the

1894
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,480
barbarians and talk to them and

1895
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,319
encourage them to try and penetrate the

1896
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,240
castle and and to take over the king.

1897
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,839
That's disgusting. That queen should be

1898
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,160
beheaded. She's not your queen. It's

1899
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,240
better to be a king in a castle without

1900
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,319
a queen than to have a queen who's

1901
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,000
encouraging the barbarians outside to

1902
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,760
overthrow you. That's disgusting. That

1903
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,920
would destroy your self-esteem. You

1904
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,760
never settle for the [ __ ] queen. never

1905
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,000
settle for the queen who who strokes the

1906
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,920
[ __ ] of the barbarians and leads them on

1907
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,280
and dances sexy for them and talks to

1908
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,640
them every day. Imagine that. Like

1909
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,079
imagine you literally were like a king

1910
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,280
of a castle and imagine right outside

1911
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,799
the castle there's men who were trying

1912
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,480
to take over but you you know the

1913
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,000
castle's hard for them to get into so

1914
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,440
they're just waiting outside and imagine

1915
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,280
you realize that your queen has been

1916
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,359
going out to speak to them every single

1917
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,960
day having funny conversations with them

1918
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,640
just encouraging them motivating them.

1919
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,640
That's [ __ ] cheating. That's

1920
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,640
cheating.

1921
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,680
Don't fall for this [ __ ] This form of

1922
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,680
manipulation, Etier. The final form of

1923
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,559
manipulation

1924
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,000
is a false

1925
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:23,119
rape accusation. There's a story of a

1926
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
young man named EMTT Till. He was a

1927
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,440
black guy in America and he had a

1928
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,920
relationship with a white woman. This

1929
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,680
was hundreds of years ago and that was

1930
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,599
extremely taboo like an inter

1931
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,000
interracial relationship back in like

1932
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,040
1800s or something. They were in love

1933
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,720
with each other till one day some of the

1934
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:46,160
town's folk saw them kissing

1935
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,880
a black boy kissing a white girl.

1936
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,480
They confronted her

1937
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,359
and instead of telling them the truth

1938
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:57,119
saying, "Yeah, I love him.

1939
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,480
It was fine." She saves her own social

1940
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,000
image because she didn't want to be

1941
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,720
judged by them. And so she tells

1942
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,839
everyone, "He forcefully kissed me."

1943
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,839
They find him in his home and they beat

1944
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,760
him and hang him to death. It's only

1945
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,680
years, like decades later, that the

1946
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,480
woman comes out and she says like, "Oh,

1947
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,640
you know, it's been so hard for me. It's

1948
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,640
been so hard dealing with what I've had

1949
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,480
to deal with." And she basically admits,

1950
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,960
"Yeah, she lied about the thing to save

1951
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,359
herself from the situation." There are

1952
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,720
hundreds if not even thousands of cases

1953
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,960
like this where a woman will manipulate

1954
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,440
the masses and she will try to convince

1955
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,359
people that a man has wronged her and he

1956
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,680
has raped her or sexually assaulted her

1957
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:39,599
or abused her when actually he didn't.

1958
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,000
Whether she did it for attention or she

1959
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,559
did it for money. This happens so often

1960
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,480
and it is the most extreme version of

1961
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,799
manipulation that a woman can possibly

1962
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,280
do. It's when she manipulates people so

1963
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:53,680
seriously where she knows that that man

1964
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,280
who the innocent man could be killed or

1965
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,359
his life could be ruined. He could be

1966
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,960
sent to prison for 20, 30 years. And

1967
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,640
girls will do this just because they're

1968
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,079
kind of pissed off at you. They'll do

1969
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,640
this just because they feel like you

1970
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,559
wronged them or you moved on too quickly

1971
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,480
or they're just emotional weird little

1972
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,079
creatures. I even had a girl say to me

1973
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,760
once, I was with her and she literally

1974
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,160
said, "Oh yeah, I've tried to accuse a

1975
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,280
man of rape before. I swear to God, I've

1976
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,760
never felt like that scared in my life.

1977
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,680
There are demons out here, girls who get

1978
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,440
like a sick kick from this. And they

1979
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,880
don't do this with an evil smile on

1980
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,720
their face, but they love to put

1981
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,880
themselves in like this victim kind of

1982
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,040
personality. Oh, another guy abused me.

1983
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,440
Oh, another guy abused me. Be very

1984
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,440
careful. If you ever meet a girl who

1985
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,839
ever talks about being raped or sexually

1986
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,000
assaulted before, it's usually never

1987
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,680
worth doing anything with them just

1988
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,280
because of the risk of like one, they're

1989
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,720
usually just [ __ ] up in their head,

1990
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,640
they usually damaged people. That's just

1991
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,960
one thing. But two, the thing is they

1992
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,319
might be lying. More often than not, it

1993
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,599
seems these days when a girl says, "Oh,

1994
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,280
I've been abused or raped." What they

1995
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,200
really mean is they had consensual sex

1996
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,640
with a guy that they realized was a bit

1997
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,040
of an [ __ ] and now they've taken

1998
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,799
consent back afterwards. The the way to

1999
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,880
find out if a woman is a lying little

2000
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,319
disgusting [ __ ] or not is when she

2001
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,920
talks about being raped, be really

2002
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,520
empathetic. Be like, "Oh my god, that's

2003
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,760
so crazy." Like, "Did you go to the

2004
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,520
police?" And when she says no, straight

2005
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,520
away you see the red flag and you think,

2006
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,680
"Oh my god, she's a dirty little lying

2007
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,280
woman. Be careful." If she says, "Yes, I

2008
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,200
went to the police. They got the

2009
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,960
evidence. He's in prison." Okay, sweet.

2010
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,880
That [ __ ] happens. She's a victim. Okay,

2011
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,720
let's be nice. Okay, fair enough. Fine.

2012
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,400
But more often than not, when a woman

2013
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,079
doesn't go to the police, it's like what

2014
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,319
happens so often is she'll have

2015
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,720
consensual sex with a guy. Months or

2016
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,400
years or decades later, she'll come out

2017
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,240
and say, "Oh, yeah, he actually abused

2018
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,920
me." Just turns out he's rich right now.

2019
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,520
He's rich and famous now. Yeah, he

2020
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,119
abused me 20 years ago. I've got no

2021
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,799
evidence. I didn't go to the police back

2022
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,640
then. There's no evidence. But yeah, he

2023
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,319
did. And the world will believe her.

2024
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,240
This happens to to guys who become

2025
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,319
famous to rich. This happens to like

2026
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,240
Hollywood celebrities. This happens like

2027
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,920
in the me too [ __ ] that happened.

2028
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,400
Basically, a guy will be rising up in

2029
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,079
life and when a girl sees that, oh [ __ ]

2030
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,200
he's got famous now. Then she'll go and

2031
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,640
attack him and be like, "Yeah, yeah,

2032
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,799
there's no evidence at all. It was 10

2033
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,000
years ago. He abused me." No. If if that

2034
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,359
was true, you would have went to the

2035
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,799
[ __ ] police back then, but you

2036
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,000
didn't. You didn't. You don't get to

2037
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,599
bring up something that happened 10

2038
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,359
years ago that you never reported as a

2039
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,960
crime because it wasn't a [ __ ] crime.

2040
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,160
It was consensual. It's just like, yeah,

2041
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,440
he was a bit of an [ __ ] to you

2042
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,720
because you were probably a bit of a

2043
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,480
[ __ ] to him as well, right? But do not

2044
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,319
fall for this [ __ ] bro. If a woman

2045
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,000
shows you a police report, okay, you can

2046
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,440
believe her. But don't fall for the

2047
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,880
[ __ ] where a girl will be like, "Oh,

2048
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,119
yeah. You know that famous guy? You know

2049
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,960
that rich guy? Yeah, 5 years ago he

2050
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,920
really abused me. Yeah, there's no

2051
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,680
evidence at all. No evidence whatsoever.

2052
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,400
But yeah, I'm a woman, so you should

2053
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,839
just believe me. [ __ ] that. There are so

2054
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,119
many cases. is I'll see if my editor can

2055
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,880
just show you screenshot after

2056
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,400
screenshot of just these false rape

2057
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,240
accusations where girls will

2058
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,760
consensually get [ __ ] by a guy and

2059
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,440
then afterwards maybe because they feel

2060
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,720
embarrassed by him or they had a

2061
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,799
boyfriend or whatever they'll just say,

2062
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,880
"Yep, you know, it was rape." And people

2063
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,960
will believe her and she will literally

2064
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,880
ruin a guy's life just to save herself

2065
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,160
from a bit of like social shame because,

2066
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,680
you know, she cheated on her boyfriend

2067
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,920
with this new guy so it's easier for her

2068
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,640
to say, "Yeah, he forced me." No, she's

2069
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,040
just a [ __ ] But the problem is when a

2070
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,960
girl makes this kind of claim, most

2071
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,200
people, men and women, will instantly

2072
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,799
just believe her, which is so wrong. In

2073
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,280
the eyes of the law, you're supposed to

2074
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,960
be innocent until proven guilty. But if

2075
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,880
you're ever accused of rape by one of

2076
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,039
these horrible little women, everyone

2077
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,400
will see that you are guilty until

2078
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,160
proven innocent. And even if you're

2079
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,599
proven innocent, a lot of people will

2080
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,200
just think you're guilty anyway because

2081
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,640
they've just associated you and your

2082
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,720
face with like, "Yeah, he's a rapist.

2083
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,760
He's an abuser." This is the most severe

2084
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:38,400
form of female manipulation. And if this

2085
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,799
ever happens to you, I am so sorry

2086
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,720
because I know for a fact like 50% of

2087
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,160
people in your life are instantly just

2088
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,160
going to believe the woman. Just because

2089
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,000
she's a woman, you're a man, you must be

2090
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,280
the bad person. Even if she's provided

2091
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,760
no evidence, even if you've got

2092
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,319
evidence, bro, it's the situation is

2093
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,680
[ __ ] This is undoubtedly the highest

2094
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:59,280
form of manipulation. S tier, S+ tier.

2095
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,880
Now, just quickly, I want to give you

2096
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,720
some advice here. If this ever happens

2097
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,400
to you in the future, you you watch this

2098
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,839
video right now just so you can mentally

2099
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,839
prepare. This is how you save yourself

2100
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:09,599
from this form of manipulation. Every

2101
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,720
girl that you sleep with, even your

2102
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,480
long-term girlfriend, keep proof, keep

2103
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,920
evidence that the sex you had with her

2104
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,359
and the time you had with her was

2105
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,520
consensual. Let's say you're about to go

2106
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,359
hook up with a girl, keep screenshots of

2107
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,039
your text messages, screen recording of

2108
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,039
your text messages. Whenever a girl

2109
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,720
leaves your place, text her like, "Oh,

2110
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,079
hey, it was a good night. Have a, you

2111
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,760
know, it was thank you for coming over."

2112
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,520
And when she replies and says, "Yeah, it

2113
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,079
was fun. You know, have a good night."

2114
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,920
Screenshot it. Record the the screen.

2115
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,680
Show the entire thing. Keep all the

2116
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,119
messages. You know how because these

2117
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,200
days you can kind of delete a message

2118
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,200
that you sent to someone. Keep all the

2119
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,520
evidence. If you ever feel a girl is

2120
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,359
like sketchy, like after you've had sex

2121
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,960
with her, or maybe even you've not had

2122
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,359
sex with her, but her behavior just

2123
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,920
seems like kind of weird. Be open to

2124
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,280
even recording like maybe the the video

2125
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,039
or maybe the, you know, you can have

2126
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,799
like voice memo or whatever. Just turn

2127
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,319
that on. that proves that, you know, it

2128
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,680
was consensual or whatever that like

2129
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,079
nothing's happened. There was actually a

2130
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,240
case I remember reading of a guy who

2131
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,520
hooks up with a girl in a nightclub

2132
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,200
bathroom. Like, so they're in, you know,

2133
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,880
they're dancing in the club. They go to

2134
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,640
the toilet, they lock the cubicle, and

2135
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,319
they have sex in there. And the next

2136
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,839
day, she said it was rape because she

2137
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,200
had a boyfriend and her friends knew

2138
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,160
that she had a boyfriend and her friends

2139
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,599
might have told, you know, her

2140
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,200
boyfriend. So, she's just said that guy

2141
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,200
raped her. But that guy actually

2142
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,640
recorded it on a voice memo where you

2143
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,319
could hear her literally saying like,

2144
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,000
"Oh, yeah, put it in me. Yeah, I would

2145
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,359
like it." Whatever. And that saved him

2146
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,880
from going to prison. Like she literally

2147
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,480
called the police. She, you know, she

2148
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,000
had evidence as well, right? Think about

2149
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,680
how [ __ ] that is. She had evidence.

2150
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,079
They took it to court, but his voice

2151
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,359
memo literally saved the day. So just be

2152
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,520
careful with this. I don't want you to

2153
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,200
be like overly neurotic and be so scared

2154
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,559
of girls, but you should actually have

2155
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,319
like a bit of fear because you'd be

2156
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,480
surprised. It's not always like the

2157
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:50,079
obvious girl who will do this to you.

2158
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,240
Sometimes they can seem like sweet,

2159
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,839
normal people. So if you ever get that

2160
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,280
gut instinct that something's wrong,

2161
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,799
collect some evidence. In fact, you may

2162
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,799
as well just collect some evidence for

2163
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,079
every girl you're with because it takes

2164
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,599
you, you know, 10 seconds to just

2165
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,119
[ __ ] screenshot the messages or

2166
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,720
screen record them. It takes you 5

2167
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,079
seconds to just put on the voice memo

2168
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,359
app when you're kind of saying good

2169
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,119
night to her outside and, you know,

2170
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,559
she's like, I had so much fun. You hear

2171
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,920
you guys kissing or something. It

2172
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,599
doesn't take much effort at all for you

2173
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,359
to just capture a bit of evidence which

2174
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,640
will be used in court and it might

2175
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,799
literally save you one day. And this is

2176
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,319
especially true if you are the type of

2177
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,920
guy who you know for a fact you're going

2178
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,119
to be [ __ ] a lot in your life. If

2179
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,400
you're like the type of guy who, you

2180
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,680
know, you're not going to ever hook up

2181
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,319
with a girl, okay, fair enough. You

2182
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,599
know, you're just gonna have a

2183
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,599
girlfriend then a wife, sweet. But if

2184
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,880
you're the type of guy who who wants to

2185
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,119
or is [ __ ] a lot, 100% be capturing

2186
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,799
this evidence. The highest tier men on

2187
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,039
the planet, they literally take this to

2188
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,920
an extreme level. They'll get girls to

2189
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,520
sign forms and to record videos of

2190
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,880
themselves saying that they consent to

2191
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,799
having sex. You know, like some some

2192
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,160
famous celebrities, rappers, whatever.

2193
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,599
if they're about to sleep with a girl,

2194
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,680
they'll quite literally have like their

2195
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,359
legal team come in and like, you know,

2196
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,640
speak to the woman and get her to sign

2197
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,920
documents and everything because they

2198
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,680
just don't want to risk it, right? Even

2199
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,559
though that sounds crazy autistic or

2200
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,599
whatever, when you really think about

2201
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,280
it, it's like it's not that big of a

2202
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,200
deal. Imagine you're like a famous guy

2203
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,480
and your like team come in one day or

2204
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,839
you know you've got some form, some

2205
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,520
documents, or you get your phone and

2206
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,799
say, "Hey, this is a bit weird, but like

2207
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,160
I'm just going to record this." Hey, do

2208
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,559
you consent to me [ __ ] you? And she's

2209
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,760
like, "What? Yeah, I like to [ __ ] really

2210
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,799
really hard. Do you want to get [ __ ]

2211
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,400
really hard?" She's like, "Yeah." You

2212
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,480
know what I It sounds a bit autistic,

2213
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,799
but imagine if that silly, like stupid

2214
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,720
little video saves you from getting put

2215
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,880
into [ __ ] prison. Just be very

2216
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,359
careful, bro, because if a girl ever

2217
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,359
accuses you of rape just by how the

2218
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,359
human brain, the collectiveness of

2219
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,880
humans work, more often than not, most

2220
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,799
people will believe her just because

2221
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,240
she's a woman. It's just that crazy.

2222
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,680
Even if there's no evidence, even if

2223
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,920
it's ridiculous, like she'll say like,

2224
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,599
"Oh, it happened 20 years ago." or some

2225
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,680
crazy [ __ ] like that, most people will

2226
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,079
just believe her. So, just be extremely

2227
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,760
careful because women can ruin your

2228
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,760
life. Think about it. A girl who loves

2229
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,599
you can use many of these forms of

2230
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,680
manipulation that we've discussed today.

2231
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,520
A girl who loves you, she can literally

2232
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,359
manipulate you to the point that you go

2233
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,720
insane. Never mind a girl who doesn't

2234
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,319
love you, who maybe even [ __ ]

2235
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,720
despises you, thinks you're an [ __ ]

2236
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:05,280
whatever. It's not crazy to say like,

2237
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,119
bro, like girls ruin men's lives more

2238
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,039
often than not. Like, if a man's life is

2239
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,640
ruined, the probability of it being

2240
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,839
because of a girl is pretty [ __ ]

2241
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,920
high. It's like one of the biggest

2242
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,239
reasons why like men's life is ruined.

2243
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,839
And this video I I really feel I've done

2244
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,920
like God's work here because we need to

2245
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,000
highlight this to guys. Women have heard

2246
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,440
so much throughout their lives that men

2247
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,199
are dangerous. Men are this. Men are

2248
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,120
that. But most guys haven't really heard

2249
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,880
this. And if we speak about it as men,

2250
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,640
it's always hushed and it's like, "Oh,

2251
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,319
stop being crazy. Stop being insecure.

2252
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,080
You're just weird. You hate women." It's

2253
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,920
not that. It's just that you need the

2254
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,400
same form of protection, too. I'm taking

2255
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,159
a hit to my sort of like brand in some

2256
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,920
ways and my social status when I make a

2257
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,520
video like this exposing like what women

2258
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,640
do to men because a lot of people will

2259
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,159
see this and be like, "Ah, this guy

2260
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,520
hates women. Oh, this guy's a weirdo.

2261
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:49,520
He's talking about women like that." But

2262
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,920
if this was a a video of a woman

2263
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,839
teaching women how to avoid manipulation

2264
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,080
and abuse, everyone would be like, "Wow,

2265
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,679
that's so wholesome, right? It's when we

2266
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,600
talk about it as like men who have went

2267
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,279
through [ __ ] with girls. Everyone just

2268
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,560
thinks of us as like we hate women." No,

2269
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,319
of course we don't. I'm making this

2270
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,920
video not so that you hate women and you

2271
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,839
get scared of them, but that you can

2272
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,520
find the girls who are manipulating you,

2273
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,199
get them out of your life ASAP, so that

2274
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,600
you can find the girl who's actually

2275
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,080
genuinely a good person. That's why what

2276
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,520
I want for you from this video. If you

2277
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,279
want more advice like this, by the way,

2278
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,880
the top link in the description is my

2279
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,799
program, Library of Adonis, where I've

2280
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,880
got hours and hours and hours of content

2281
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:28,159
like this, some of which is even like

2282
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,839
too controversial for me to post here on

2283
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,839
YouTube. and you you would probably love

2284
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:33,600
to join the community of guys who can

2285
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,880
openly speak about [ __ ] like this. We've

2286
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,319
got guys who come in there and they're

2287
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,759
able to get support of like, you know,

2288
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,279
the [ __ ] that's happening with some girl

2289
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,880
right now. And so, it's a really

2290
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,400
beautiful place for you to come into to

2291
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,839
be surrounded by other guys on

2292
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,799
self-improvement who are on the same

2293
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:48,640
path as you. Jeffree to Adonis, do the

2294
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:51,600
hard work, especially when you don't

2295
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,600
feel like it. Wa!
