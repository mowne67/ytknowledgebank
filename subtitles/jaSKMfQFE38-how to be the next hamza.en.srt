1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,240
I woke up from a dream I saw a Pakistani

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,680
man wearing a bathrobe emerging from the

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,320
sky and he looks at me and he whispers

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,240
you are the Adonis now no one is going

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,560
to replace Hamza cuz Hamza that you see

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,320
on screen is not the entire Hamza the

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Hamza off screen is extremely logical

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,359
extremely intelligent and on screen

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,080
Hamza leans into his emotional

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
intelligence he leans into his

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,800
relatability I'm not trying to say that

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,320
Hamza is being disingenuous or dishonest

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm just saying Hamza has different

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
aspects of his personality and depending

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,000
on what he's trying to communicate and

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,079
who he's communicating with he has the

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,879
emotional ability to regulate his

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,600
personality in that way HS of being as

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
intelligent as he actually is he knew

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,000
exactly what he was doing when he

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,960
inspired you to make your YouTube

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,239
channel to start your YouTube Journey

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,640
but I am here to tell you that you will

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
most likely fail so what am I doing here

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm trying to make myself some eggnog in

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,320
the next 5 to 10 minutes I'm going to

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,480
tell you why your YouTube channel is

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,519
going to fail and hopefully make myself

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,199
some amazing eggnog along the way for

30
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,439
those of you do know eggnog is a protein

31
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,600
Rich fatri amazing testosterone boosting

32
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,680
drink so long as it's made correctly so

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,439
eggnog is a Christmas tradition and you

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,960
know people like me from India we don't

35
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,799
really celebrate Christmas so I learned

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
it from a friend so Hamza sells the idea

37
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,600
that all you need to succeed on YouTube

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,200
is radical honesty consistency and

39
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
sharing your journey through your own

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,920
self-improvement I don't think that's

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,439
true cuz nobody cares about your

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,240
self-improvement journey bro nobody

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,880
cares about your noof fap Journey man

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,200
okay so you were struggling with porn

45
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,759
addiction and drugs and whatever it was

46
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,240
and then now you go to the gym and now

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,320
women finally wants to talk to you

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,360
nobody cares that story has been done

49
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,640
Hamza has a monopoly on the

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,320
self-improvement Journey of breaking

51
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,840
drugs and bad habits and becoming Adonis

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
so if you are trying to do the same

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,280
exact thing as Hamza you are going to

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,119
fail you cannot out Hamza Hamza

55
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,600
understand if you're doing a

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,799
self-improvement type Channel then Hamza

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,000
is your enemy Hamza is the competition

58
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,880
that's the guy you're trying to take

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,159
views away from and you were not going

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,399
to succeed I guarantee you Hamza has

61
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,640
some serious advantages in the space

62
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,319
firstly I've already talked about how

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,920
Hamza is intelligent more intelligent

64
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,440
than you think he's also very well

65
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,760
spoken he has an amazing camera presence

66
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,560
he's also relatively handsome and he's

67
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,200
also jacked you might know the first

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
video of his that actually blew up was

69
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,720
his aesthetic body transformation video

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
so he was already jacked before he got

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,319
big on his channel he used that as a

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
leverage and as a advantage to grow his

73
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,959
masculinity Channel because of course if

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
you want to build a masculinity Channel

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,879
you better be looking masculine he's

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,640
also perfected his storytelling skills

77
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,560
and if Hamza worked on storytelling

78
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,640
skills for years before he got as good

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,879
as he is right now so when you are

80
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,120
trying to start a self-improvement

81
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,000
journey that's the guy who you're

82
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,200
competing with so what am I doing here

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,200
I've added myself one cup of whole milk

84
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,599
I'm going to do half a cup of what's

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,440
called heavy whipping cream this has all

86
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,200
the fats so ham tells you this idea that

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
if you are just two steps ahead of the

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,120
guy who you're trying to to help then

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
that's enough and that person can learn

90
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,599
from you I disagree with this imagine

91
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,080
you're learning boxing right do you want

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,640
to learn boxing from the guy who just

93
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,720
has one more year of experience than you

94
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,440
in boxing no you don't you want to learn

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
boxing from a champion you know you want

96
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,599
to learn boxing from somebody who's

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,720
actually been in the ring and has won

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,080
some competitions you want to learn

99
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,000
boxing from a guy who knows how to box

100
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
and same's true for self-improvement I

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
have no problem with learning things

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
from Hamza because he has been on the

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,439
journey longer than I have that's why

104
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,000
his content sells you on the other hand

105
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,519
you barely started why would other

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
people who want to listen to your story

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,560
and the idea of relatability so Hamza

108
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,280
tries to paint himself as a relatable

109
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,319
character and he does a very good job of

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,879
this but understand that relatability is

111
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,360
not a virtue in itself just because

112
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,200
you're relatable doesn't mean I want to

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,840
watch your content Andrew Tate is a good

114
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,159
example of this he's not relatable at

115
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,040
all what color is your guy Ander Tade is

116
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,680
an aspirational type motivational

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,079
speaker he's in prison now he's highly

118
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,040
controversial regardless of what you

119
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,959
think about him the fact is he did a

120
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,959
excellent job of promoting you know

121
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,000
hyper masculine character but not being

122
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,360
relatable but rather by being an

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,720
aspirational figure for a lot of young

124
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,519
men and I was reminded of this idea from

125
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Jake Tran that people will watch you

126
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,319
people consume content if you provide

127
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,760
them an unfair Advantage if you're

128
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,360
trying to create a channel on YouTube

129
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,120
you need to be providing something that

130
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,359
nobody else can provide providing an

131
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,040
angle that nobody else can compete with

132
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,560
and also giving your audience something

133
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,160
that's going to give them an advantage

134
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,400
in whatever they're pursuing so I'm

135
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,040
going to go ahead and separate these egg

136
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,520
yolks from the whites so what I'm going

137
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,639
to do is catch the yolks and let the

138
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,080
whites just go through my fingers and

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
separate them that's the easiest way I

140
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,400
know to separate the eggs from the

141
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
whites if you have a better idea feel

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,960
free to add that to the comments I'll

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,960
call you out and of course everything

144
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm saying to you is true for my channel

145
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,440
so I cannot continue to use hamza's name

146
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,880
to get views and likes and comments the

147
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
fact is that's simply unsustainable I

148
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,840
need to be providing you value which is

149
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,320
independent of Hamza I need to have a

150
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
different Edge and provide different

151
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
value so that I'm not competing with

152
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,280
Hamza well I already know what that is

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,120
for me I'm a biologist and so I know a

154
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,680
lot about nutrition and health I'm going

155
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,919
to create this channel around boosting

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,160
your testosterone because my view is

157
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,240
that even before mental health hormonal

158
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,639
health comes first my view and you might

159
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,160
disagree with it is you fix your

160
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,800
hormonal health and your mental health

161
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,880
fixes itself and so does your physical

162
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,680
health see hs's framework is you fix

163
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,759
your mental health first and that's the

164
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,720
cause for improvement across your life I

165
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,319
don't disagree with that but my view is

166
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
hormonal health comes even before that

167
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,800
so in this channel you're going to learn

168
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,400
cooking skills you're going to learn how

169
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
to make yourself highly nutritious

170
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
testosterone boosting food while you

171
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,360
pursue your self-improvement my take on

172
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,960
this is completely different from

173
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
hamza's I've never seen Hamza cook

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
anything I also have military experience

175
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,199
so I can share stories from being a

176
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,400
machine gunner in the US Army and that's

177
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,199
something completely different which

178
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,039
Hamza is not able to do these things

179
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
these experiences my journey and my

180
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,160
unique knowledge about hormones and

181
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,960
testosterone Etc give me an edge which

182
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,520
Hamza doesn't have gives me a

183
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
competitive space in which I'm not

184
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,520
competing directly with him and then

185
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
there's the issue of

186
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
commitment so you want to get your egg

187
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,360
whites whisk that you can kind of see

188
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,960
these Peaks forming that's perfect so

189
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,280
the issue of commitment now you might

190
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,680
think commitment is the same thing as

191
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,800
discipline and you might say I'm

192
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,240
committed to YouTube I'm going to make

193
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,919
three videos per week commitment is not

194
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,120
the same thing as discipline for example

195
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,039
I'm committed because my video editor

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,240
Jan I've committed that I'm going to pay

197
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,919
him full-time salary for 3 months and

198
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,680
that means I'm going to have to use his

199
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,479
skills that means I have to produce the

200
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,479
videos to justify his pay so I'm

201
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,080
committed my money is already committed

202
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,599
to this purpose that in my opinion is a

203
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
higher level than just straight up this

204
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,360
discipline all right I'm going to put

205
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,319
this milk mixture on the

206
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
heat hopefully I don't focus on this and

207
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,400
let it boil over but we'll see so

208
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
commitment is not simply this iron mind

209
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,319
idea all you andate types are going to

210
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
be like iron mind I'm disciplined I can

211
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,720
[ __ ] be committed no commitment is

212
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,280
also about creating success Frameworks

213
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
success structures in your life which

214
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,639
help you to do the things that you want

215
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,639
to do for example my gym has this unique

216
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,199
feature hats off to them I commit to

217
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,800
being at the gym at a certain time at a

218
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,840
certain day and if I don't check in at

219
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
the time they actually find me $5 yeah

220
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,440
$5 is not a lot but that $5 commitment

221
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,160
gets me to the gym when I promise I'll

222
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,000
be there that's an example of a success

223
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,240
structure that keeps me going even if I

224
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,960
don't feel like going all right just

225
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,120
going to wait for this milk to start

226
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,280
steaming all right so I don't want to

227
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,759
get my milk to a boil I'm going to stop

228
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,400
when it just starts steaming right

229
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,759
that's when it's going to be perfect so

230
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,639
I've gone ahead and added my whisked egg

231
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,879
whites to the milk now I'm going to go

232
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,759
ahead break these yolks mix them up a

233
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,800
little bit yeah there it is add it in

234
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,520
blend this mixture and of course you

235
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
have vanilla extract which you don't

236
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,199
really need for this recipe but I do

237
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,120
think it adds a little bit extra taste

238
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,520
so I've been giving you discouragement

239
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,039
for 10 minutes straight I've been

240
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,759
telling you all the reasons why your

241
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,520
YouTube channel is going to fail at this

242
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,879
point if you decide that perhaps you

243
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,720
need to wait for a little bit longer

244
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,720
until you find that edge and then come

245
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,520
back to YouTube then you have my

246
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,240
understanding if you instead decide that

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
you're going to go for it anyways that

248
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,479
you think you're ready and you're going

249
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,560
to do YouTube regardless of what I've

250
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
said just now then you have my respect
