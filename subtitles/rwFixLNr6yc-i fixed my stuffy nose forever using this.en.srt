1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,200
inferior turbulent mucosal reduction

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,359
they literally wanted to put a drill up

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,440
my nose and carve out the center bone a

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,780
little bit so that I could finally

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,599
breathe with my nose that's how bad the

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,400
situation was until I finally embraced

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,920
the esoteric Health methods which I'm

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
going to show you I don't use any of

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
these sprays these steroid sprays and I

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
finally can breathe better than I've

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,180
ever breathed before and even just from

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,859
my voice you can tell that breathing is

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,260
not a problem for me anymore first thing

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,820
you got to do is stop using these things

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,859
so this is the thing which gave me a lot

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,420
of problems this substance will

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,760
literally cause the inner membrane of

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,860
your nose to grow new wanes and arteries

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,719
and actually swell and grow in size to

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,340
the point they actually need surgery to

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,100
get it out this was given to me by a

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,780
doctor be careful what you learn or do

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,820
even if it's from a medical professional

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,860
so all I'm going to say about that so I

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,020
have stopped using these sprays entirely

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,579
and I'm going to show you the esoteric

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,140
methods which I have found which have

28
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,239
been used for thousands of years and

29
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,000
continue to be effective starting with

30
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,280
your new friend alkalol so I found this

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,100
substance is so good this is completely

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,619
organic it's only made of herbal oils so

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,860
this is an excellent product they give

34
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,320
you the alcohol alcohol with this little

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,700
nasal dispenser thing I'll show you how

36
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,159
to use these but also I want to

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,600
introduce you to the Neti Pot but this

38
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,640
is also an ancient invention like

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,860
historical records we can find it in the

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,600
museum these exact things dating

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,640
thousands of years ago this has been

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,659
used by humans for God knows how long so

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,380
this plus the alcohol alkalol plus these

44
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,340
salt packets solve 90 of your issues all

45
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,140
right I'm going to show you how to use

46
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,500
it so what you do take the salt packet

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,920
one thing of salt take the alcohol just

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,140
a bit of alcohol then you add water and

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,880
I'll put b-roll on here which shows you

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,799
how to use it so basically what you do

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
is you add the water and then you go to

52
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,880
your bathroom you go to your sink and

53
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,680
then you put the spout on one nostril

54
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,840
and then tilt it so that the water flows

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,579
up one nostril and then out the other

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
nostrils it'll just clean the entire

57
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,600
nasal exactly and that way he'll remove

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,159
any allergens the alcohol is very

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,020
interesting well it does it it kind of

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,660
irritates the nose a little bit and

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,640
allows it to eject all the excess mucus

62
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,099
immediately and the salt buffer is there

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,620
so that there's no dryness in the nose

64
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,780
so the salt plus the alcohol plus the

65
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,300
Neti Pot amazing combination I don't see

66
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,680
anybody else suggesting it so I'm I'm

67
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,840
glad to bring this method to your

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Consciousness that's about the Neti Pot

69
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,099
and then we have the other things on

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,540
this list so we have the Breathe Right

71
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,459
Strips right that's what I'm putting on

72
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,440
my nose right now I use this when I'm

73
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,819
sleeping it just expands the nasal

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
passages a little bit so that you have

75
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,940
better nose breathing and you're less

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,739
prone to mouth breathing but even then

77
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,620
when I'm sleeping I have tape I'll just

78
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,239
take a small strip of tape and something

79
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,739
like that put it over my mouth that'll

80
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,300
prevent my mouth from opening when I'm

81
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,980
sleeping and that ensures that I'm only

82
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,800
nose breathing when I'm sleeping that

83
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,780
plus the nasal strip works wonders I get

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
maximum quality sleep speaking of sleep

85
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,340
if you want the esoteric sleep guide let

86
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,500
me know in the comments right and so

87
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,900
that's Max maximizes My Sleep Quality

88
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,180
among many other sleep practices which

89
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,920
you surely will learn in the future so

90
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,360
how often should you use the Neti Pot

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,700
and how often should you use the alcohol

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,800
twice a day or once a day so it depends

93
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,659
on how much you need it right I use it

94
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,879
twice a day I do it once in the morning

95
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,860
immediately after I wake up and once

96
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,900
just before sleeping now even if you

97
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,060
didn't have a runny nose or a stuffy

98
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,800
nose or any symptoms you should still do

99
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,780
this thing you should still use a Neti

100
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,159
Pot maybe once a day okay even if you

101
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,840
don't use a Neti Pot that's fine you

102
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,239
should still be taping your mouth and

103
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,980
using a breath trip for your sleep it's

104
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,659
going to increase your power output

105
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,940
because it gives you more oxygen the

106
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,680
more oxygen your body can use the more

107
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,260
energy it can produce so more

108
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,480
productivity more relaxed and better

109
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,040
feeling throughout the day breathing is

110
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,900
everything if you aren't breathing right

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,940
you aren't living right and I will

112
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,739
finish this video off with a breath

113
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,599
practice which I've learned my

114
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,819
grandmother taught it to me and it's

115
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,739
amazing it's a combination of breathing

116
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,299
and meditation it works really well it's

117
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,440
great for mental health and of course

118
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,180
the breathing which is physical health

119
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,980
Oh and before I forget when you're

120
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,799
putting water into the Neti Pot it has

121
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,500
to be purified water filtered water or

122
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,360
distilled water or boiled water at least

123
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,860
otherwise you're going to get an

124
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
infection you're going to get a brain

125
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,100
infection you like might actually die

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,660
because of it so be careful what water

127
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,299
you're using and before we get into the

128
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,500
breathing practice mewing so mewing is

129
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,320
an interesting one because I've never

130
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,900
actually done it let me or rather I've

131
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,880
always done it so I didn't know that the

132
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,220
term was mewing until a couple years ago

133
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I've always just always kept my tongue

134
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,060
in the roof over the mouth like mewing

135
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,040
says to do and you know I'm pretty happy

136
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,080
with my face structure right and before

137
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,400
I teach you the breathing practice

138
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,199
cardio does cardio help absolutely

139
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,880
cardio will boost your productivity

140
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,979
throughout the day by giving you more

141
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,960
oxygen more energy and I don't like

142
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,180
running I find running really boring so

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,460
I do the others other more fun cardios

144
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,620
do Hills prints Hill Sprints are just

145
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,139
much more fun than just regular Sprints

146
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,660
and then there's of course Barrel carry

147
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,639
so buy yourself a big barrel of water

148
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,620
and just hoist it on your shoulder and

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,320
start walking up some stairs that's

150
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,180
killer cardio most important type of

151
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,500
cardio that there is which is simply

152
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,360
just walking I'm not talking about

153
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,560
jogging I'm not talking about fast

154
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,680
walking I'm just talking about just

155
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,000
walking nice and slow in the morning

156
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,000
preferably in nature but not necessary

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,520
so this is one of the key components of

158
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,259
my esoteric morning routine this is

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,900
important because as you're walking

160
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,520
around you're gonna breathe nice and

161
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,020
deep you're using your diaphragm to

162
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,460
breathe your diaphragm is the muscle at

163
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,160
the base of your lungs you're using your

164
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,440
diaphragm tonight be nice and deep into

165
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,960
the belly inside just your upper chest

166
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,060
and what that does is it oxygenates you

167
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,460
so you're increasing your oxygen intake

168
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,740
in the morning exactly when you want it

169
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,419
so you can have that energy through the

170
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,160
rest of the day if you're doing it

171
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,020
outdoors in nature that's even better

172
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
for the of course the mental health

173
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,539
benefits and what's especially important

174
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,539
for the dopamine system is the sunlight

175
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,940
what you might not know is the eyes the

176
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,560
retina behind the eyes is actually an

177
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,139
important part of the dopamine system

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,240
and what happens there is as you expose

179
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,500
yourself to early morning sunlight and

180
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,600
honestly doesn't even have to be early

181
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,060
morning like right now it's just

182
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,280
um nine nine a.m closing yourself to

183
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,620
sunlight allowing sunlight to hit your

184
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,660
retina is an important important part of

185
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,000
your dopamine system and that way you

186
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,160
essentially recharge the amount of

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,020
dopamine in your body every morning and

188
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,300
then we are finally here at the

189
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,360
breathing exercise which I promised you

190
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,060
this is what you do take your right hand

191
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,340
fold your index and middle fingers let

192
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,600
me Center myself a little bit and you

193
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,280
can do this sitting down on the floor

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,319
you can sit on the chair like how I'm

195
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,780
doing it doesn't really matter I like to

196
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,860
Do It Outdoors in the morning but here

197
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,060
we are I'm doing this for the video

198
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,280
right

199
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,100
so what you do and and hear this

200
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,740
carefully so what you do is you cover

201
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,680
one nostril with your thumb and take an

202
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,560
inhale with the open nostril and then

203
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,680
you close that and open the other

204
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,180
nostril and you let the air out and then

205
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,880
you'll take in air

206
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,880
and then let it out so in

207
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,240
out

208
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,660
in

209
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,960
and out

210
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,620
in

211
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,400
and out

212
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,819
what this does now it is kind of fast I

213
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,979
did it fast because I'm on camera and

214
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,840
this is a video and all that right but

215
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,539
ideally I do it at my own pace really

216
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,620
slow really be mindful about my

217
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,840
breathing

218
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,180
and this is like meditation on steroids

219
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,039
meditation is difficult because you get

220
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,539
bored right your mind wanders and the

221
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,580
whole point of meditation is to bring it

222
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,960
back to the breathing or at least be

223
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,080
conscious of the wandering I understand

224
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,840
I understand but meditation is hard this

225
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,520
is much easier and in many ways equally

226
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,780
effective what you're going to do is

227
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
you're going to be focusing on the

228
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,740
breathing and you're going to be

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,259
focusing on that pacing and that that

230
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,660
makes your mind focused the breath is an

231
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,979
interesting thing most of the day you're

232
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,680
breathing and you're breathing

233
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,639
unconsciously of course if you don't

234
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
want to be paying attention to your

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,319
breath throughout the day but you can

236
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,180
you can voluntarily breathe you can

237
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,520
choose the pacing of your breathing you

238
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,759
can breathe voluntarily and also it's an

239
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,220
involuntary function correct so when you

240
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,459
breathe voluntarily with intention and

241
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,500
having attention on the breath it tells

242
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,380
your body that you're not in flight or

243
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,039
fight mode it tells your body that it's

244
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,440
in relax and rest and digest mode and by

245
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
giving your body that sense of calm

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,620
because this is how you communicate with

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
your body your mind doesn't want to be

248
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,120
stressed but your mind doesn't get to

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,920
choose that your body may be stressed so

250
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,800
you tell the body you know there's no

251
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,959
physical threat you're fine relax and

252
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,459
you can do that by using the breath as

253
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,200
the language the breath is the language

254
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,700
between your mind and your body you can

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
use the breath to communicate with the

256
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,500
body and say calm down there's no

257
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,500
physical threat you can relax you can

258
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,740
reset you can breathe so in summary

259
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,260
every morning do this breathing exercise

260
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,480
as I showed you it will change things

261
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,339
for you I guarantee you it might change

262
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,779
things more fast than meditation could

263
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,860
it might be more effective than

264
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:28,320
journaling even so 100 high Roi habit

265
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,920
100 I guarantee and there we have it

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,300
