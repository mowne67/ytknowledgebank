1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,880
so why would you want to read a science

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,240
fiction series full of gigachad super

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,360
soldiers rampaging in the Galaxy

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,719
fathered by these Gene Titan demigods

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,639
who are all ruled by this massively

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,000
overpowered psychically able Emperor on

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,800
the surface level well it's fun it's

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,800
enjoyable to read these stories they're

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,080
complicated plots interesting Mysteries

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,039
to solve and you have stories of Duty

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
strength and honor also you have stories

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,519
of treachery debauchery and degeneracy

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,640
plus your over laying all this on a

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,079
system of warfare and strategy so all

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,559
these things are extremely appealing to

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,680
me I loved all this stuff so it makes

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,920
perfect sense for me to read it that's

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,760
the surface level though on the deeper

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,800
level it asks the fundamental questions

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,800
of society meaning and personal life and

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
that's the reason why you would ever

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,280
read fiction you read literature and

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,520
fiction because that's the way you get

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,879
at deeper truths for example what role

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
does faith and religion play in a societ

26
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,720
Society that's gravitating more and more

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,960
towards science are there domains where

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,720
science is irrelevant and what is

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,680
Brotherhood anyway what is loyalty is

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,439
loyalty just Blind Faith or is there

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
some kind of cognition some kind of

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
judgment required even for loyalty then

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,799
what's the correct balance of power of

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
government should government be

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,759
perfectly rigid and enforce all laws at

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,119
all times or should government have some

37
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,439
ability for individuals to have freedom

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
and what if that freedom comes at risks

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,000
then of course course the Aesthetics the

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,680
aesthetic understanding is very

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,880
overlooked in the modern world the

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,360
modern ethos states that it's always

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,560
function over form and quite often

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,960
you're left with neither function nor

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,159
form so it's very important to cultivate

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,520
an understanding of the Aesthetics and

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,320
indeed this was something which almost

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,079
every single civilized culture taught

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,520
their students taught their young men

50
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,680
this series The Horus heresy has the

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,399
epicness the greatness The Valor of

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,360
something like The Iliad or the Odyssey

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,280
it brings those great works of Homer

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,439
into the modern and in fact into the

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
science fiction realm and I've read dead

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,319
in the ODC and I see these parallels

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,000
between them it's beautiful it's able to

58
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,319
discuss the greatest philosophies for

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,080
example when is it appropriate to show

60
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,160
mercy and when is it appropriate to show

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,879
complete Relentless War I will see the

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,879
Galaxy freed once

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,360
more so what the hell am I talking about

64
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,840
like let me Orient you because obviously

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,000
this channel is is not a 40K L Channel

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,599
anything like that so the Horus heresy

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,840
is a book series which takes place

68
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,680
within the Warhammer 40K universe and

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,599
this is a massive massive Series this

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,040
book series is more than 50 books long

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,360
can you imagine that like you would

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,440
think that the Harry Potter series was

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
long because it had eight books Horus

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,560
heres's

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,440
550 books but luckily you don't have to

76
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,879
read all of them to make sense and I'll

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
give you basically the best of the best

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,159
books within the Horus heresy so you can

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,560
enjoy them and get value from them

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
without literally reading every single

81
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,760
book

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,000
from the Skies of Terror to the galactic

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,319
Rim I'm going to tell you right now that

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,760
this is a vast and crazy detailed

85
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,599
Universe which I love but it might be a

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
lot to get into in the first place I

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,760
understand that's a huge barrier to

88
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,519
entry that's fine ignore the barrier to

89
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,280
entry it's literally fiction so don't

90
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,959
overthink it just jump into the book

91
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,720
series exactly in the order which I give

92
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,040
them and you'll be fine like the level

93
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,879
of detail in this series is staggering

94
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,439
there's

95
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,799
20 there's 18 there's 18 Legions each

96
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,720
Legion has their own different strategy

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
of War each Legion has their own

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Aesthetics their own color scheme and

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,280
everything each Legion has its own

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,519
Primark which is like the leader of the

101
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,599
Legion and each Primark has their own

102
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,200
backstory their own character Arc and

103
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,280
everything so it gets really complicated

104
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,159
real fast but luckily each book only

105
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,599
usually deals with one Legion at a time

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,920
so first let me give you the absolute

107
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,280
Basics that you might want to know

108
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,319
before you get into the series first

109
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,120
thing which like really got me

110
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,439
interested into this into this universe

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
is that humans aren't like the weakling

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
spe species where all the other aliens

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,319
have better technology than us in this

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,280
universe humans are the big ones the

115
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,079
humans have the biggest empire which is

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
ridiculous completely inverting what

117
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,959
most science fiction universes have and

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,640
the first book of the series starts off

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,040
with Humanity on the ascent humanity is

120
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,280
growing across the Galaxy so get that

121
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,280
this science fiction universe is Galaxy

122
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,880
spanning like the entire Milky Way

123
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,160
galaxy is within the purview of this

124
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,400
universe so when I say the Imperium of

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,560
man I'm talking about like this Imperium

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,120
owns the whole galaxy and there are

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,880
other aliens but they've kind of been

128
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,680
pushed into the sides and at the center

129
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,520
of this massive universe is Earth our

130
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,720
same Earth which is in this universe

131
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,960
they call it Tera and in Tera there is

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,240
the Emperor the Emperor of mankind and

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,919
this kind gentleman has created 20

134
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,400
primar Prim marks are like demigods and

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
the emperor himself is practically a God

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
but he creates these Prim marks which

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,199
are massively powerful fate bending

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,639
Destiny wielding massively overpowered

139
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,360
super soldiers and using the gene seed

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,520
from each Primark you can create Space

141
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,199
Marines which themselves like stand

142
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,240
twice the height of a regular man and

143
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,960
are massively powerful like each single

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,919
Space Marine would be as strong as the

145
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
most elite soldier of any other universe

146
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,039
and the most important thing for me is

147
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,120
the aesthetic sense there's no

148
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,720
minimalism in this universe everything

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,680
is to the max the artwork is over the

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,319
top it's beautiful it's detailed it's

151
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,560
rich in a world when most science

152
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,400
fiction universes or any kind of

153
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,280
universe tries to go for minimalism or

154
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,560
realism 40K goes for the opposite we go

155
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,560
for the maximum level of detail

156
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,240
possible so now let's jump into the book

157
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
list and if you have a book in mind that

158
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
I don't include just put in the comments

159
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,639
so book one we have of course Horus

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,479
Rising so this book series like I said

161
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,560
is 50 books long right but there's kind

162
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,240
of like mini series within them so it's

163
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,639
kind of like clumps clumps of books

164
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,080
which go well together and you kind of

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,120
have to read them as a chunk without

166
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,120
skipping in between so the first chunk

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,800
like the opening Saga of this Horus

168
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,360
heresy starts with Horus rising and you

169
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,520
absolutely should read the first five

170
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,800
books one after the other the first five

171
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,759
books are Horus Rising false gods Galaxy

172
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,639
in Flames Flight of the eisenstein and F

173
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,919
Grim so you need to read all these five

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,360
to get started with the series they're

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
all really great books and you'll enjoy

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
them so getting right into it right so

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,039
Horus Rising Horus Rising so there's a

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,160
Primark named Horus who is the name of

179
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,960
the entire series Horus heresy and he's

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
important because he is the leader of

181
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,479
the traitor primarch so I mentioned

182
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,400
there's 18 primarch some of them turn

183
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,759
bad it's a civil war so the Horus heresy

184
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,840
is a civil war absolutely brutal man

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,520
like this series is the distillation of

186
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,240
all civil wars in our own human history

187
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
you start off with a bad side almost

188
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,479
being justifiable in their reproach and

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,160
then slowly the world the universe

190
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,840
deteriorates piece by piece and you're

191
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,560
left with nothing and no side really

192
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,400
wins because both sides are destroyed

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
almost starting off with Horus Rising so

194
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
our boy Horus he was appointed by the

195
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
Emperor as the leader of all the

196
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,680
primarch and at this point all the

197
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
primarchs are good none of them have

198
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,680
fallen so the first three books Horus

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,840
Rising false gods and Galaxy and Flames

200
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,120
details the fall of Horus and how he

201
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,160
turns against his father so Horus is the

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,720
chosen son right he's the favored son of

203
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,080
the emperor and he knows it he is the

204
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,639
most beloved he is the highest praised

205
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,199
primarch among all the primarch and

206
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
everybody's jealous of him but the thing

207
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,240
is this gets to his head when the Empire

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
leaves the Crusade so all the primar are

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,879
basically at war with the Universe At

210
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Large and they're doing this huge thing

211
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,440
called the Great Crusade and the emperor

212
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,479
leaves the emperor leaves and this means

213
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,960
that the Crusade is no longer the most

214
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,720
important Focus for the Emperor or by

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,360
extension mankind so at the same time

216
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,080
Horus becomes a leader of all the

217
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,560
primarchs but he also loses meaning in

218
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,479
the Crusade itself so when a man loses

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,319
meaning in life he can do two things he

220
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,919
can look within himself get on

221
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,919
self-improvement read way of the

222
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,400
superior man by David daa and start

223
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,080
doing meditation and gratitude

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
journaling and all this stuff and become

225
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,879
a better person theyel his own talents

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,479
right this is not what Horus does Horus

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,280
grows bitter and resentful and a series

228
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,120
of events happen with treachery within

229
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,520
his own Legion which pushes him slowly

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
across the edge into embracing the

231
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,960
powers of chaos and you got to think the

232
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,400
primar are the leader of each Legion but

233
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,080
each Legion has thousands upon thousands

234
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,199
of Space Marines and some of them will

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,960
go loyal to the emperor and some of them

236
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,400
will won't be loyal to the Primark so

237
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Horus has to kind of eliminate V section

238
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,360
of his own Army in order to make it

239
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,000
loyal to him so this book is truly about

240
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,440
Brotherhood and loyalty it's about

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ethics and it's about sacrifice strongly

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,919
recommend you need to smash out the

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,399
three first books and before we go into

244
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,760
the next book I got to say that these

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
first three books detail something

246
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,839
called the istan 3 atrocity which is a

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,000
massacre and this is not really a

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,480
spoiler because anybody who's in 40K or

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,680
wants to get into it knows of this event

250
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,399
and it's very very compelling brutal

251
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
next book is Flight of the eisenstein

252
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,839
also a mustre because this details how

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,720
horus's treachery and the treachery of

254
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
some of its traitor Brothers gets word

255
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,920
to Terra and lets the emperor know so

256
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,000
that the Loyalists are kind of starting

257
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,160
to prepare for this Invasion this one

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,880
has less Mass scale battles but it kind

259
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,040
of Narrows the scope to a single

260
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,279
Battleship and the actions of A Few Good

261
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,600
Men highly recommend it's a mustre and

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,880
then we have number five F Grim this

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,760
details the fall of the Primark fulgrim

264
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,519
and this book is about excess so as we

265
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
develop oursel we're on the path of

266
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,040
ascent we're improving oursel we're on

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,079
self-improvement we're going to the gym

268
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,480
improving our bodies and seeking some

269
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,720
kind of perfection at what point does

270
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,800
this become obsessive and at what point

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,920
does the pursuit of perfection lead to

272
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,079
its opposite that's the philosophical

273
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,360
point which kind of comes out in the

274
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,680
book fulgrim fulgrim is a Primark of

275
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,360
perfection he is the perfect swordsman

276
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,880
he's the perfect battle tactician he's

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,760
also a man of art he's also a man of

278
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,279
learning learning so what happens when

279
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,200
his love for music and art and culture

280
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,480
goes to the extreme what happens when he

281
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,040
achieves Perfection but he doesn't know

282
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
what to do next and how this can drive a

283
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,480
good man mad that is the story of

284
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,279
fulgrim book number five completely a

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,680
highly recommended then we skip over

286
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,399
book six and go into book seven so the

287
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,480
first five books kind of contain

288
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,240
themselves they're kind of their own

289
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,480
thing and then you can jump straight to

290
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,200
book s book s stands alone it's a book

291
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,480
called Legion by Dan ABN and Legion is

292
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,160
about the alpha Legion so Alpha Legion

293
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,959
is one of those I said there's 18

294
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,399
Legions right so there 18 Legions one of

295
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,000
them is the alpha Legion Alpha Legion is

296
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,200
the master of Espionage trickery having

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,079
double agents spycraft all this stuff so

298
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Alpha Legion books are a treat because

299
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,519
Alpha Legion books are usually

300
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,440
structured in a kind of like a mystery

301
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,880
like you don't know what you're getting

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,760
into and you really don't know what to

303
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,839
expect chapter by chapter a legion is no

304
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,200
different Legion is a mystery book

305
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,000
disguised as a war book and it details

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
some very important plot points for the

307
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,959
the Horus heresy it details why the

308
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,680
alpha Legion which is ostensibly for the

309
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:09,720
emperor goes against him so is the alpha

310
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,920
Legion a traitor or a loyalist well even

311
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,760
after you read the book you might have

312
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,959
questions then we skip over book eight

313
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,839
battle for the abyss we skip over book n

314
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,600
mechanicum we skip over book 10 tales of

315
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,399
heresy skip over 11 and then we come to

316
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,880
12 a thousand Sons by Graham McNeil this

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,680
is the Magnus the red book this is the

318
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,839
Thousand Sons book and this is one of my

319
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,519
favorite Legions so the thousand suns

320
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,279
are are special Legion it's a very small

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
Legion but one of the most powerful if

322
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
not the most powerful because almost

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
every single soldier within this is a

324
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Space Marine but also a psycher Space

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
Marine psychers in this universe are

326
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,440
basically individuals who can draw upon

327
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,760
the power of the warp in order to do

328
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,160
magic basically they can shoot out

329
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,160
lightning from their fingers they can

330
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,720
read the future the powers of the warp

331
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,120
are used in many different ways you can

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,160
use it as a weapon you can use it as a

333
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,160
strategy in any case the thousand suns

334
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,360
are very powerful magic Legion and their

335
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,880
Primark Magnus red is one of the most

336
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,079
powerful Primark and he's 100% loyal to

337
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
the emperor but then there's an event in

338
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,040
this book which happens where Magnus

339
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,240
feels betrayed by the emperor there's

340
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,399
this Council called the Council of nikea

341
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,839
which is very reminiscent of the actual

342
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,079
real world example the Council of NAA

343
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,959
happened in the city of NAA in the Roman

344
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,480
province of bethia in 325 ad and the the

345
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,000
Christian the church was in crisis

346
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,800
different Bishops believed different

347
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,399
things and it was up to the emperor to

348
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,079
decide what was Christianity and what

349
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,720
was heresy and this is exactly what

350
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,040
happens in this Horus heresy book The

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,199
Emperor has to decide whether magnus's

352
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,399
use of the warp was allowed or it was

353
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,000
heresy and here's the thing the emperor

354
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,120
himself is one of the most powerful

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,320
psychers to ever have lived so for him

356
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,600
to say that using psychic powers was a

357
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,480
heresy was very hypocritical and this

358
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,360
book is about the pursuit of knowledge

359
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,440
how much knowledge is good and this is a

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,160
problem that we actually facing in

361
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,480
society right now the internet exists

362
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,440
and we have so much knowledge at our

363
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,839
disposal at what point does it stop

364
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,199
being helpful and of course we having ai

365
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
ai allows information synthesis to

366
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,320
happen at a very different way than it

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,839
ever happened before what are the Perils

368
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,000
of this technology and more deeply this

369
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,920
is about epistemology does there exist

370
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,959
something called forbidden knowledge is

371
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,399
there knowledge that is so toxic that is

372
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,160
better that we don't even know it and

373
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
even up to this point so Magnus feels

374
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,120
betrayed by the emperor and he is the

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
most powerful for Primark but even

376
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,800
though he feels betrayed he is still

377
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,920
100% 100% loyal but he is arrogant

378
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,440
because he's so powerful and he is

379
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,399
himself a psycher so he thinks he knows

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
everything Magnus is the champion of

381
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,120
knowledge and because he thinks he can

382
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
even see the future his own level of

383
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,480
knowledge becomes a handicap Horus and

384
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,240
the forces of chaos are able to trick

385
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,639
Magnus into doing something very wrong

386
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,880
indeed basically Magnus goes against his

387
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,839
father's dictate that all psychic

388
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,920
energies are supposed to be heretical

389
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,839
and Magnus has has the best intentions

390
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,720
in mind and yet he makes a mistake so

391
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,800
terrible that at this point the tide

392
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,120
shifts so until this point the Imperium

393
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,759
still could have won at this point

394
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
there's still a bunch of loyal Legions

395
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,120
and the emperor himself could take the

396
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
field plus he had his whole custodes

397
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,160
Legion which is one of the most powerful

398
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,959
Legions there is and at this point the

399
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,880
emperor could have absolutely won the

400
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,320
war outright by going and killing Horus

401
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,959
himself but because of magnus's mistakes

402
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,560
caused by his arrogance in his own

403
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,240
knowledge now the tides have turned and

404
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,759
the traitor really are in the ascendant

405
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,560
highly recommend one of the best books

406
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,120
in the series and after this book you

407
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,880
immediately jump to Prospero Burns so

408
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,160
Prospero Burns is not the exact next

409
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,800
book in the series but it continues

410
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,399
story-wise it's the next book right it's

411
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,560
not the next book in terms of

412
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,560
publication but in terms of story it is

413
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,320
so jump from thousand suns directly onto

414
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,720
Prospero Burns because what happens is

415
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,720
because the emperor thinks that Magnus

416
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
has turned traitor even though he hasn't

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
he sends one of his other Legions the

418
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
Space Wolves to destroy the Thousand

419
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
Suns

420
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,920
the Space Wolves and the Thousand Suns

421
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,959
both are loyal at this time and they're

422
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,360
brought into conflict simply because of

423
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,480
arrogance misunderstanding and of course

424
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,399
manipulation by outside forces so in the

425
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,639
Thousand Suns we see the Thousand Suns

426
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,680
perspective of that war and in the

427
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
Prospero Burns book we see the space w

428
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,480
side of that war it from Reading from

429
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,199
both perspectives is really cool because

430
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,880
both sides genuinely believe that they

431
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:27,360
are doing the right thing but at the end

432
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,600
both sides are badly muled and the only

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,880
real winner is cha and Horus himself so

434
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,480
the Imperium cops of fat L on this one

435
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,000
highly recommend both books then we skip

436
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,199
over book number 13 and we jump to book

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,880
number 14 the first heretic by Aaron

438
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,480
diky Bowen this book is about the word

439
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,120
bearers Legion the word bearers and

440
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,319
their primar lurg guard were actually

441
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
the first to fall it wasn't actually

442
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,040
Horus Horus was the leader of the

443
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,639
traitors yes but lorgar had fallen

444
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,040
decades before Horus ever did and this

445
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,160
this was also a mistake by the emperor

446
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
so the emperor had a strict rule that

447
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,160
nobody should worship him as a God but

448
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,880
lurar he really wanted to and he

449
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,480
absolutely did he was building temples

450
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,279
and converting entire planets to the

451
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,040
worship of the emperor and the emperor

452
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,519
really didn't want worship because he

453
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,000
believed that worship fueled by Blind

454
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,560
Faith is what gives chaos its power I

455
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,680
haven't really talked about chaos but

456
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,560
and that's a philosophical discussion

457
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,480
for later so when the emperor realizes

458
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,079
that lorgar is creating a whole new

459
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,480
religion based on him he punishes lorgar

460
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,920
you know that saying you should always

461
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,079
praise in public but punish in silent

462
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,759
well the emperor did not get the memo he

463
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,519
punishes lar he humiliates him in front

464
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,519
of his brothers now understandably lar

465
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,480
is pissed the [ __ ] off and he wants to

466
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,680
take revenge he's in a very bad State

467
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,440
because the man who he believed to be a

468
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,399
God has treated him so poorly now he's

469
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,839
bitter he's resentful and this

470
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,920
bitterness and resent was co-opted by

471
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
the forces of chaos to turn him to their

472
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,920
side I mean amazing book about ethics

473
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
about what's true and what's false and

474
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,880
what's good and what's bad because these

475
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,559
things may not align perfectly and then

476
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,640
we go so this okay so remember I said

477
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,120
that these books kind of Clump up as

478
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,880
story lines after reading first heretic

479
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,199
you go all the way to no no fear book

480
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,000
number 19 so you go from 14 straight to

481
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,799
19 no no fear is a classic no no fear is

482
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,520
about the ultramarines legion the

483
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,559
ultramarines are led by their Primark

484
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,039
Rabe Gilman and what happens here is RO

485
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,280
rute gilan was there when the emperor

486
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,919
humiliated lorgar so basically lorgar

487
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,120
was humiliated in front of rute by his

488
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,840
father so he carries a lot of resentment

489
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,320
against his father but also for Gillan

490
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,280
for being there and in fact Gilman's

491
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
Legion was used to destroy one of his

492
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,880
most important cities and his own Planet

493
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
so he has a lot of anger towards Gillan

494
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,480
and of course lar is siding with Horus

495
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,400
so Horus basically commands lar to

496
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,880
destroy the ultral legion at this point

497
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
the ultramarines don't know what's going

498
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,600
on they don't know there's a heresy at

499
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,159
play completely oblivious so both

500
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,640
Legions are amassing at this planet

501
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,039
called calp and at Cal they are getting

502
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,919
ready for an invasion of the Orcs which

503
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,480
are completely different zenos race but

504
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,880
there are no Orcs because this whole

505
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,240
thing was a setup and lorgar's Legion is

506
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,280
basically ambushing the ultramarines

507
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,360
legion and they completely have

508
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,120
advantage of the element of surprise

509
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,679
they open fire on the friendly

510
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,640
ultramarines and decimate them but you

511
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,240
see the ultramarines are no joke this is

512
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,280
a legion based on real life Roman Empire

513
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,679
so they had discipline they have tactics

514
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,559
they were very Resolute and they could

515
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,880
change their tactics on the Fly and

516
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,280
really respond with Breakneck speed and

517
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,799
they did they fought against the word

518
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,320
bearers even though they were at a

519
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,400
disadvantage but the word bearers

520
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,559
started unleashing demons so the word

521
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,679
bears are the masters of the warp they

522
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,240
were able to control not even control

523
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,280
but just Co up the darkest sides of

524
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,400
chaos and unleash these demons and mon

525
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,960
monsters from another realm which at

526
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,440
this point the ultramarines didn't even

527
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
know they existed so now they're

528
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,000
fighting a whole different type of enemy

529
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
which they never encountered before but

530
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,559
by God they are the ultramarines and

531
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,360
they don't give up so they find new

532
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,919
tactics to defeat these demons on top of

533
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,559
their traitor brothers and despite the

534
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,400
fact that the war bears were going to

535
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
annihilate the ultramarine religion

536
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,840
they're able to regroup and escape to

537
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,360
fight another day and that day comes the

538
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,679
next book called book number 24 betrayer

539
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,200
by Aaron demsky Bowen this book is the

540
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
avengeance of the ultramarines the

541
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,679
ultramarines see an opportunity to

542
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,559
attack the word bearers and there's

543
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,320
another Legion called the world eaters

544
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,240
Legion and their Primark angron angron

545
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,200
is a living weapon so each of these

546
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,440
primarchs have their own skills so for

547
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,840
example ruti gilan is the master of

548
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,679
strategy I had mentioned before Horus

549
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,679
Horus is the master of the Tactical

550
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,600
strike another primar that we mentioned

551
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,880
Magnus Magnus is the master of magic and

552
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,559
the warp then we had lorgar who is the

553
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,200
master of mass psychology we also

554
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,360
mentioned the primar fulgrim he is the

555
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,679
master of Art and Perfection but angron

556
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,080
is the master of war and single combat

557
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,360
so angron is no joke to go against on

558
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
top of that lar was also with him but

559
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,799
the ultra Marines a strong and powerful

560
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,960
Legion so they decide to attack the

561
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,960
world bearers and the world leaders at

562
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,720
the same time and that is the story of

563
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,919
this book betrayer and this is a book

564
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,080
about friendship and Brotherhood more

565
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,400
than anything because this book really

566
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,000
Narrows the scope to two Warriors to

567
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,159
arel tal and K both very well-written

568
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,520
characters and these are the bad guys so

569
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,000
it's a really cool book because many of

570
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,000
these books you're always rooting for

571
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,880
the good guys to win obviously but in

572
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,640
this book the stars of the show are the

573
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,760
bad guys and it's a really cool other

574
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,120
side take on this narrative 28 here we

575
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,520
go 28 introduces you to the white scars

576
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,240
Legion this book is called Scars by

577
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,840
Chris R and the white scars Legion has

578
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,640
been all the way in the other side of

579
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,559
the Galaxy so all the [ __ ] is happening

580
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,200
in the middle of the Galaxy Horus is

581
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,720
here he's trying to kill the Imperium

582
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,640
the imperi is trying to fight back on

583
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,360
the other side we have gilan and what

584
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,600
happens in the previous book is Gilman

585
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,120
kind of gets trapped he's not able to

586
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
come to the rescue of his father and on

587
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,159
the other side we have the white scars

588
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,120
Legion who can come but they don't know

589
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,279
what's going on they've been so distant

590
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,640
from the rest of the universe that they

591
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,600
don't know who's good and who's bad

592
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
they've been fed lies that the emperor

593
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,200
betrayed Horus and the Horus is a good

594
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,440
guy they don't know what to believe and

595
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,640
this is another book about epistemology

596
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,559
how do you trust the information to you

597
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,240
so the primarch of the white scars jagon

598
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,200
is a very well- written character he's

599
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
very normal like all of the Space

600
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,720
Marines and all the primarch are

601
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,200
autistic to the level 9 man they all

602
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,159
have big egos take drastic action all

603
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,480
the time without thinking jagat tyon is

604
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,159
a very reasonable and calm Soul so when

605
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,000
he sees conflicting information he wants

606
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,000
proof before he can proceed he's very

607
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,240
reasonable so in this book we see how a

608
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,039
reasonable primarch actually behaves and

609
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,120
jagon is a master of speed his entire

610
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,240
entire Legion is around speed speed

611
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,400
speed like they attack fast and they

612
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,120
withdraw and they attack and they

613
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,880
withdraw so it's a very different type

614
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,600
of fighting style than any of the

615
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,880
legions that we saw before so it's cool

616
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,200
to see a different take on strategy so

617
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,000
highly recommend book 28 Scars by Chris

618
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,440
ra 36 36 is path of Heaven Again by

619
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,159
Chris Rait this is a continuation direct

620
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,120
continuation from book 28 scars so

621
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,880
finished scars and the very next book is

622
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,279
path of Heaven by Chris ra and this is

623
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,520
the conclusion of the white scars Legacy

624
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,080
white scars like I said were trapped in

625
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,240
the other side of the Galaxy and there's

626
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,640
traitors all over the place and then

627
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,640
there's Tera they need to make it

628
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,919
through all the traders to get to Tera

629
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,640
and this is the book which shows you how

630
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,120
they do it and this book is about

631
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,679
sacrifice man there is a scene and a

632
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,200
story arc in this book which is

633
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,720
absolutely brutal this book is about

634
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,240
when you have a higher goal what level

635
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,600
of pain are you able to go through in

636
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,799
order to make that higher goal a

637
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,799
possibility even if you never see it so

638
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,679
very powerful very drama IC book The

639
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,159
skip over 38 you should also read book

640
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,760
39 petoran of Dorne so petoran of Dorne

641
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,919
is when the Traders are really close the

642
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,559
Traders have reached the soul system and

643
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,919
they're attacking Pluto which is of

644
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,279
course the outer ring of the solar

645
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,520
system defenses and this has your

646
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,840
Primark rogal Dorn so rogal Dorn is the

647
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,679
petorian of Tera which means that he was

648
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
appointed by the emperor himself to

649
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,120
fortif five and hold the salt system and

650
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
rogal dor is Master tactician himself he

651
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,240
is the master of Siege craft so he has

652
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,440
transformed the soul system into an

653
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,640
absolute nightmare to attack he has

654
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,080
fortified everything and we have another

655
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
primarch in this book named alarius of

656
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,440
the alpha Legion and You' have met

657
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
alpharius already in Legion and this

658
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,880
time he's attacking the outer parameters

659
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,880
of the Soul system in order to get to

660
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Terror so we have a face off between

661
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,720
extremely cunning and crafty Primark the

662
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,200
literally the Primark of treachery

663
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,240
alarus and against the most like

664
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,400
stern-faced loyal guy rogal Dorn so

665
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,559
highly recommend book 39 petoran of

666
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Dorne 41 is another solid one master of

667
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,679
mankind by Aaron demsky Bowen so I said

668
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,039
the emperor is at the center of

669
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,840
everything right but this is the first

670
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,640
time we actually see him in action in

671
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,039
master of mankind so remember when I

672
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,000
said Magnus [ __ ] things up and then

673
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,080
the emperor couldn't get off his ass and

674
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,640
go and actually fight Horus this is

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,279
where we find out what actually happened

676
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,440
so Magnus he had a foreshadowing of

677
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,480
horus's betrayal so he breaks his

678
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,880
father's orders of not using magic and

679
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,039
he uses his warp power to teleport

680
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,840
himself all the way from his planet of

681
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,039
Prospero all the way to Tera to inform

682
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,120
his father but in doing so he

683
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,960
accidentally breaks all the shields his

684
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,360
father had so the Father the Emperor of

685
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,720
mankind he of course guarded his Palace

686
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,480
both with physical walls but also

687
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,640
psychic Wards and Magnus is a very very

688
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,960
powerful psycher so it's only him in the

689
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,640
entire galaxy who could have broken

690
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,799
through so Magnus was actually coming to

691
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,360
warn his father about heresy and in

692
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,279
doing so he destroyed destroys those

693
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
psychic Wards in order to get to his

694
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:05,200
father but because he's broken those

695
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,200
psychic Wards now other forces can also

696
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,559
get to his father so at this point

697
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
Magnus had destroyed the emperor's

698
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,320
project and the emperor had his own

699
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,120
battle to fight within Tera itself

700
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,080
because demons were coming into Tera and

701
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,600
the emperor had to manage that full time

702
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,760
and so he couldn't take the battlefield

703
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,080
himself and master of mankind details

704
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,240
the story of that battle and that war

705
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,200
very cool because you can see the

706
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,080
emperor in action you see the custodies

707
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,200
and you see a hella powerful demon

708
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,399
called draenen and the philosophy behind

709
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,559
this demon is interesting so this is the

710
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,039
demon of the first murder so we didn't

711
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,200
really talk about chaos at all until

712
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,600
this point so the idea of Chaos in this

713
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,919
universe is that there is a metaphysical

714
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,080
realm on top of the Physical Realm which

715
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,919
is completely governed by emotion as

716
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,039
beings in the Physical Realm die could

717
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,480
be humans could be xenos their pain and

718
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,440
suffering bleeds into this imum so the

719
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,080
alternate reality and in this alternate

720
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,720
reality it people's suffering can turn

721
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,159
into cognizant life forms and the echo

722
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,240
of the first murder so the first time a

723
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,520
human being killed another human being

724
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,399
that caused an emotion to be formed in

725
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,039
the warp and this emotion very small at

726
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:18,200
first but as murders started happening

727
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:20,399
more and more throughout the entire line

728
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,159
of human history this demon become

729
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,200
powerful and more powerful at the end

730
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
