1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,600
300 is the movie the Greeks themselves

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,240
would have made it perfectly encapsulate

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,840
the Greek mindset and indeed this is why

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,200
the dark film critics still fro at the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,839
mouth when they hear the name of

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,679
Leonidas and his 300 Spartans even the

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,279
history nerds will often spaz out when

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,760
they hear about the movie 300 cuz

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,640
they'll say things like oh but the

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,240
Spartans wore heavy bronze armor they

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,680
weren't half naked while they fought at

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,680
thermopolymerization

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,120
they try to fight as much as possible in

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,719
a shield wall formation but all this

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,079
misses the point because if you look at

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,680
the actual artwork created by the Greeks

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,840
on Wes you'll find that they portray the

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,120
Spartans fighting exactly like how they

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,840
do in the movie they show Spartans and

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,920
other Greeks fighting one-on-one they

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,360
showed them fighting half naked if not

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,719
fully naked in this video you're going

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,399
to see a completely contrarian take on

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,359
the movie 300 not only that but you'll

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
also receive answers to such questions

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,640
as why modern historians push the agenda

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,359
that the Greeks were gay so hard and

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,800
does it have any basis in reality you

29
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,280
also gain new insights about how

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,960
democracy in the Greek World actually

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,840
works and you'll even get a brief

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,640
introduction to the art of understanding

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,200
history and Civics but trust me this is

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,119
no history lesson this is about the

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
Spartan mindset and what we can learn

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,799
from them not only about Society at

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
large but how we can improve ourselves

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
you see most people don't know this but

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,280
the movie 300 is 100% accurate to the

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
mindset that the Greeks had and no movie

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,280
like 300 will ever be made again think

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,159
about this the modern Hollywood society

43
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,200
would never make a movie glorifies honor

44
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,720
Duty courage and individual action they

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,680
would never make a movie which shows

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,799
that it is okay to fight for one's own

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,479
people and even when 300 was released

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
most critics did not support that movie

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,119
when they aired that movie in the Berlin

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,719
Film Festival a lot of these neroid

51
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,880
critics actually got up and left cuz

52
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,520
they couldn't tolerate what they were

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
watching on screen the only inaccurate

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,439
thing about the movie 300 is that

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,159
Leonidas was actually 60 years old at

56
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,840
the time of the battle of theropo you

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,799
see at the time of this battle old man

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,640
Leonidas was old as your grandfather and

59
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,799
yet he could absolutely outrun you he

60
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,079
could outfight you he could outlift you

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,039
and here's the thing he could probably

62
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,360
outthink you these men were better than

63
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,200
us almost every single metric in this

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
video I seek to answer the question why

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
is it that the Spartans captur the male

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,160
psyche so well at the sight of the

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,560
battle of theropo there's an Epitaph and

68
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,200
what it says is tell the Spartans passer

69
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,720
by that here by Spartan law they lie but

70
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,560
the story of the 300 Spartans doesn't

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,800
start there the story of the Greco

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Persian War starts decades earlier at

73
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
the Battle of Marathon and some of you

74
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,000
might have heard the story of the

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,200
marathon Race how it started that the

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,920
Greek Runner runs for what is it 26

77
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,560
miles and then he collapses dead but

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,480
this is not the full story of the

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,640
marathon Race you see the battle was

80
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,360
fought at this beach called Marathon

81
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,480
Persians made their landing at this

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
beach and the Athenians were waiting for

83
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,519
them you see the Athenians not the

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
Spartans were completely outnumbered by

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
the Persian Force what the Persians

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
expected them to do was to hold up in

87
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,360
the city of Athens which had walls at

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
the time and just you know Siege it out

89
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,959
but the Athenians had another plan they

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,040
would wait in Ambush they would would

91
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,640
wait for the Persian forces to land at

92
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,200
the beach and before the Persians had

93
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,440
the chance to get out of their boats and

94
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
really set themselves up they would

95
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,760
attack immediately pushing them back

96
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,120
into the ocean and this day did imagine

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
if you're a Persian Soldier you get out

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,080
of your boat you know your ship with

99
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,200
your horses and whatnot after months of

100
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,560
travel your seasick you haven't walked

101
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
or exercised properly in months and now

102
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,920
you suddenly see on the horizon a tide

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
of bronze Shields coming at you with

104
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
everything they've got it must have been

105
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
a terrifying sight and absolutely the

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
Athenians slaughtered them and

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,920
immediately after this pitched back ATT

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,840
they marched 26 miles back to the city

109
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,040
of Athens to prevent another attack on

110
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,760
their city and you have to understand

111
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
these weren't the special forces of

112
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,239
Athens these were just the citizen

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,200
soldiers of Athens this was her everyday

114
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,200
citizen of Athens performing a feat a

115
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,599
military feat and a physical feat as

116
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,319
great as anything which our best special

117
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,799
operators would struggle to do that's

118
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,439
right the average Athenian citizen was

119
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
as good as our special forces and Navy

120
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,200
Seals and speaking of the Athenians as

121
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,319
the Spartans were demolishing the

122
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,159
Persian Army at the mopi the Athenians

123
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,480
were sending the Persian Fleet to the

124
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,040
bottom of the ocean at salamis decades

125
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,720
later when the Persians decided to

126
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,519
resume their attack and this time go

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
through the mountain passes they had the

128
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,799
terrible misfortune of meeting Leonidas

129
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,479
and his 300 each of the 300 was an apex

130
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,320
predator each and every Warrior of them

131
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,199
could absolutely lead troops in battle

132
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,759
they could conduct CT operations they

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,520
could fight hand to hand or they can

134
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,440
fight in formation they could conduct

135
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,000
night raids or they could form Shield

136
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,800
wall but here's the thing each of them

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,160
was trained also in ret public speaking

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,440
writing reading Civics history culture

139
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,639
religion debate and logic these weren't

140
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,880
just soldiers these were the citizen

141
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,520
Elite of Sparta and each of them was

142
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,360
considered a warrior monk a sword Saint

143
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,560
they not only honed their skill at War

144
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,360
and physical Prest they also hone their

145
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,360
mind to Perfection you see this is what

146
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,440
I consider to be the classical man the

147
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,199
Spartans were famed across the

148
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
mediterian for being quick witted and

149
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,000
well spoken not in the sense that they

150
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
could debate for long hours or give huge

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,759
speeches no they were Fame for being tur

152
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,160
your Fame for saying the minimum amount

153
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,880
of words to make the Maximum Impact this

154
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,520
requires a mind as Keen as their swords

155
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,680
you couldn't bribe them you couldn't

156
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,199
bargain with them you couldn't scop them

157
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,759
and you couldn't manipulate them and

158
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,320
certainly you couldn't threaten them

159
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,400
when Philip II the father of Alexander

160
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,319
came to conquer Sparta what he says is

161
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,280
if I conquer you I will destroy your

162
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,919
city I will enslave your women I will

163
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,160
kill your children and the Spartans

164
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,600
reply with just one word if and even in

165
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
the movie they do a good job of showing

166
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,680
this when the Persian messenger comes

167
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,919
and says says you know our arrows will

168
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,520
blot out the Sun the Spartans simply say

169
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,440
okay cool we'll fight in the shade but

170
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,800
now you think these Spartans were always

171
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,759
you know Dow and tur always talking

172
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
about discipline and warfare but I don't

173
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,400
think this is true I think if you look

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
at the elite soldiers of today if you

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
look at the way Navy Seals Army SF

176
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
Rangers conduct themselves they aren't a

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,680
bunch of strict disciplinarians who only

178
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,319
focus on discipline discipline

179
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,039
discipline they're actually really funny

180
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,479
they're actually really good socially

181
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,800
they can absolutely hang out they can

182
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,080
drink they can party they enjoy life and

183
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,479
indeed the more Elite the soldiers the

184
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,919
better Bond and Brotherhood they have

185
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,720
with each other they have their own

186
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,120
internal language their own internal

187
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
Words which only they understand they

188
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,280
have these unique experiences which no

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Outsider can really respect and only by

190
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,319
really joining a part of these SF teams

191
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,280
or Navy SEAL Teams whatever it is can

192
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,199
you truly be a part of them the spec op

193
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,720
guys are some of the least neurotic

194
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,240
people on the entire planet they've

195
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,840
mastered so many skills that they've

196
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,479
gotten to a point of immense perfect

197
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
confidence in themselves this means they

198
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,120
practically have zero anxiety not only

199
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,599
do they know that they can fight it out

200
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,759
in the field they also know they can

201
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,000
survive indefinitely out there they know

202
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,800
that if somebody gets shot they can

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
patch them up often times these guys are

204
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,800
competent in multiple languages I

205
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,199
suspect that after a Spartan goes

206
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,919
through the initial training phase after

207
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,840
that it's not a bad life probably after

208
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,680
that the adult Spartan who are already

209
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,840
initiated into the order they would just

210
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
work out train on weapons play sports

211
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
get massages Under the Sun and then go

212
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,360
back to their wives even in the movie

213
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,120
they show this when the Persian arrows

214
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,599
come flying down the Spartans get under

215
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,879
their shield and they're just laughing

216
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,400
this is exactly how modern SF would have

217
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,800
reacted to the same situation now moving

218
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,560
to a different topic within this a lot

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,360
of film critics and articles have come

220
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
out criticizing the Spartans in fact

221
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,879
criticizing the idea that the Spartans

222
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
should be respected and should occupy

223
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,039
such a big space in the cultural

224
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,639
Zeitgeist they said that Spartans can

225
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,360
only do what they could do you know be

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,360
full-time soldiers because they had

227
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,879
slaves and slavery is bad therefore

228
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,479
Spartan society should not be remembered

229
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,720
tons of movie reviews and historical

230
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,039
fact Checkers and article writers always

231
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,680
criticize the Spartans because they had

232
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,280
slav they say the Spartans are

233
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,879
hypocritical when the movie shows them

234
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,319
to be fighting for Freedom when the

235
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,440
Spartans themselves had a whole bunch of

236
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,960
slaves yes the Spartans had slaves but

237
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,400
they were not hypocritical you see the

238
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,919
Spartans didn't believe in Freedom as an

239
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,440
abstraction they didn't care about

240
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,960
Freedom as some Universal concept or a

241
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,000
human right they only cared about their

242
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,879
own freedom and went through atrocious

243
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,120
lengths to preserve that they knew that

244
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,400
freedom isn't free and it's only paid by

245
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,759
Blood now the lesson from this is not

246
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,520
that slavery is good The Lesson from

247
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,080
this is very specific and this is the

248
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,000
lesson of history at large you see

249
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,039
history has one iron rule the strong

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
take what they will and the weak must

251
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,240
suffer what they must this is the

252
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
Ironclad rule of history there are no

253
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
exceptions to this rule our modern

254
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,639
ethics saying yes slavery is bad is

255
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
completely inconsequential the only

256
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,680
thing of consequence is can we enforce

257
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,240
that or not it doesn't matter if you

258
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,440
condemn the Spartans for having slaves

259
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,720
or not I want you to understand that

260
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,800
Concepts like freedom and human rights

261
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,000
only have any meaning so long as the

262
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
power of violence is used to enforce

263
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
their presence and indeed in a society

264
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,000
where most men are scoped into

265
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,680
degeneracy and imbecility the powers

266
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,880
that be can use these Concepts like

267
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,320
civil liberties and freedom and human

268
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,080
rights to perpetuate the exact opposite

269
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
of what these Concepts truly mean the

270
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,320
same us which supposedly goes to war for

271
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,800
human rights abuses commits those exact

272
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,000
same abuses and any dork film critic who

273
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,600
wants to criticize as Spartans for

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,959
holding slaves where there is slavery

275
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,399
today there is slavery in many parts of

276
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
the globe who do you think built the

277
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,320
skyscrapers of Dubai who do you think

278
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,120
makes up the workforce of countries like

279
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
Oman there's slavery out there today if

280
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,519
you care about the topic so much then

281
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,240
why don't you go and fight them that's

282
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
right these film critics and all these

283
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,720
leftists who rage against slavery they

284
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
don't actually do anything about it do

285
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,399
they because again the iron law of

286
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,040
History states that the strong take what

287
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,079
they will and the weak must suffer what

288
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,200
they must all this means is you and I

289
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,279
must be at the level of capability to

290
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,880
protect our own freedoms that's the true

291
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,399
lesson which is taught by Spartans

292
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,279
holding slaves if you don't want to be a

293
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,959
slave then you have to be able to rise

294
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,920
up against your Masters while yes the

295
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,959
Ultimate Force is always physical

296
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,640
violence that is always to be treated as

297
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,800
the last possible Resort if you feel

298
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,120
like your country is being led astray

299
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,880
and if you remain silent then you are a

300
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,279
part of the problem coming back to the

301
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,200
question of why it is that the Spartans

302
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,480
captured the psyche so well it's because

303
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,880
people that have pride in themselves and

304
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,560
indeed prioritize their own Freedom not

305
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,839
as an abstraction but rather as a true

306
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
need in the blood these people are not

307
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,880
to be subjugated they will pay any cost

308
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,320
cost in blood for their freedom

309
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,680
Extinction is preferable to subjugation

310
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,360
for such peoples and of course the

311
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,320
Greeks and the SPs were not the only

312
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,640
people like this the Germanic tribes

313
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,360
across the danu would rather die to a

314
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,680
man rather than being subjugated by the

315
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,120
Romans many Native American tribes would

316
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,680
rather perish than be yolked by the

317
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,480
white man did not porus the Elephant

318
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,640
King of India rather fight than

319
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,360
subjugate himself to Alexander who

320
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,480
literally conquered the rest of the

321
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,079
Known World this is the kind of attitude

322
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,600
that I want to instill upon the individ

323
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,399
idual and therefore have an effect on

324
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,480
Society at large the core of all this is

325
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,399
simply to say that rights and freedoms

326
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
only have any meaning if you're willing

327
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,800
to use them and indeed bleed for them if

328
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,839
need be and I want you to be completely

329
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Incorruptible as the Spartans were when

330
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,160
the Persians offered to the Spartans

331
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
endless gold all the land of Greece and

332
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,680
to make the Spartan King the warlord of

333
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,240
all Greece the Spartans refuse when the

334
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,959
Persians asked them to lay down their

335
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,920
arms the Spartan simply hold on to their

336
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,839
weapons and say come and take them and

337
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,839
indeed for example even in modern times

338
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,839
the the US didn't gain its independence

339
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,040
through peaceful protest now did it I'd

340
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,560
argue that the fundamental freedoms of

341
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,440
the United States citizen rests not upon

342
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,120
the First Amendment but the second if

343
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,000
you're interested in Greek and Roman

344
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,160
history you'll often come across this

345
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,200
line of argument that homosexuality was

346
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,279
very much common in Greece this is an

347
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,839
utter sop completely false completely BS

348
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,360
this line of argument was completely

349
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,279
fabricated by modern historians the

350
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,320
evidence for this is so sparse okay you

351
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,800
don't understand so the big evidence

352
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,720
which these kind of historians Point

353
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,959
towards is a few artworks which may

354
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,680
portray homosexuality but it's utter

355
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:42,880
nonsense among a huge volume of art

356
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,360
maybe one or two a very tiny fraction

357
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,519
show anything that could be considered

358
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,800
homosexuality and what's the thing is

359
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,320
this isn't between two men usually it's

360
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,320
between mythological creatures like

361
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
saturs it's very bizarre that they could

362
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,600
take one or two random artworks and

363
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,079
claimed that yes Greek was this LGBT

364
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Paradise if you want to know more about

365
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,040
this specific topic a link to a video

366
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,680
down below modern writers even push this

367
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,160
idea that Achilles was gay absolutely

368
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,440
pathetic this is this is why this

369
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
happens all right the legendary

370
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
friendship between Achilles and patrus

371
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,199
is made to seem as a gay relationship

372
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,880
because the writers the modern nerd

373
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,839
historian cannot even conceive that such

374
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,240
a friendship could be truly a friendship

375
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,040
because such friendships don't even

376
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,720
exist today such a deep bond between two

377
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,720
men is immediately made suspicious it's

378
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,399
immediately made trans transactional and

379
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,160
immediately made carnal but this

380
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,560
reflects not the Greeks but rather the

381
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,839
poverty of our current historical

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,720
community and indeed the poverty of our

383
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,120
society which doesn't have that kind of

384
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,839
friendship anymore and indeed strong

385
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,000
bonds between young men is the most

386
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,800
powerful and indeed most destabilizing

387
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,399
factor in a stagnant Society this is one

388
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,120
of the reasons why the modern film

389
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,880
critic hates this movie so much and this

390
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
is the reason why you and I enjoy this

391
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,839
movie so much cuz we feel it in our

392
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,519
blood we know in our bones that this is

393
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,639
how it was meant to be and for this

394
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,760
reason I give the movie 300 a 4.5

395
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,959
Corinthian Helms out of five why only

396
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,920
4.5 why not just a total score of five

397
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,040
out of five because there's this stupid

398
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,560
plotline in this movie of the Spartan

399
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,240
Queen you see like I said before I have

400
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,600
a lot of respect for Spartan women they

401
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,800
were very very capable but in this movie

402
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,199
all the queen really does is sleeps with

403
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,240
another man while her husband is out

404
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,320
fighting for her freedom and the idea is

405
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
she did this in order to help him

406
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
because to send a Greek army to support

407
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,839
him but even this doesn't really work it

408
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,760
completely backfires and she ends up

409
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,120
having to steal a sword from the

410
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,680
traitorous Senator and going to stab him

411
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,880
and it only works because that

412
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,320
traitorous Senator had Persian coins in

413
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,040
his wallet so everybody knew that he was

414
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,639
a traitor instantly this is a stupid

415
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,800
plotline and it does a lot of Injustice

416
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,320
to the True Glory of the Spartan wom it

417
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,079
almost shows it as though Spartan

418
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,880
woman's only weapon was to use sex but

419
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,959
that's not true Spartan women were as

420
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,320
smart and cunning as Spartan men so they

421
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,160
could have had a better flot line for

422
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,880
that which is why I give it a 4.5 out of

423
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,320
five but now the final question is

424
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,240
Spartan society to be emulated was it

425
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,000
perfect hardly I can prove it to you in

426
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,399
the historical context bartan Society

427
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,040
was so traditional and so aifi that they

428
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,839
were becoming militarily inefficient

429
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,639
after the Greco Persian War when the

430
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,839
Persians had been beaten and sent away a

431
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,440
new war started a war between Athens and

432
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,720
Sparta and Sparta was on the losing side

433
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,720
Athens was almost going to win the

434
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,240
Athenians had a better economy they were

435
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,959
modernizing faster they had better

436
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,360
technology they had more scholarship

437
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,880
they had everything going for them and

438
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,800
because the Spartans stuck to their

439
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,480
tradition so much they weren't able to

440
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,759
make progress and in the end the

441
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,920
Spartans only won against the Athenians

442
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,040
because they literally took money from

443
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,279
the Persians to do it so no absolutely

444
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,920
Sparta is not perfect as a society

445
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,680
because Sparta would have literally lost

446
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
against Athens if it wasn't for the

447
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,920
bribes that they took from the Persians

448
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,759
and also a devastating plague which hit

449
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,079
the Athenian so wise man looks at

450
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,519
history understands what's going on

451
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,240
takes the parts which he should copy and

452
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,320
rejects the parts that he should not and

453
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,279
you know I'll tell you something funny

454
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,880
about this video like very meta right so

455
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,360
when I was writing the script for this

456
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,120
video which was a couple months ago I

457
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
happened to look up the date of the

458
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,880
battle of theropo as part of the

459
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,880
research and it happened just by pure

460
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,800
coincidence happened to be the same date

461
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,680
as when I was writing the script which

462
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,279
you know how what a coincidence right I

463
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,279
see that as a good omen
