1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,040
the esoteric moment has been taken over

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
by husters twinks and retards what's

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,880
happened after the covid crisis is a

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,639
complete mistrust of Science and I get

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,639
it I feel betrayed too but this mistrust

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,400
has been co-opted by charlatans Crooks

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,920
and quacks to make a quick buck in this

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,640
module I will cut through the noise and

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
give you the truth I will expose the

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,119
scam supplements and show you the

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,840
synergistic supplement systems that

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,439
actually work so here's the deal sex

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,079
cells and testosterone is the molecule

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,200
of sex so quite understandably there's a

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,440
massive business opportunity out here

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,440
any supplement that can Market itself as

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,960
a testosterone booster makes Bank

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,960
especially if they can find some new

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,120
novel ingredient that's esoteric

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,280
sounding such that the target market

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,920
hasn't heard of it guys are taking pine

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,879
pollen because they think it's going to

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,879
give them phyto testosterone they're

24
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,760
taking deer antler wet because they

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,440
think they're going to get the igf1 from

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,519
there for their height they take tonot

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,600
Alit make their balls bigger now there's

28
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,960
Tribulus there's testerone there's

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,520
stinging nettle schilit there's appenine

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,960
and ashwag gandha all these make the

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,360
promise of testosterone mood and energy

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,040
but here's what I see guys will take all

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,000
of these and still behave like losers

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,479
and then for productivity there's the

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,479
huprine there's nicotine there's Lions M

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
this Alpha GPC they take all of these

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,600
and still absolutely not get any work

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,159
done guys will take five HTP Gaba myo

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,960
inositol and chamomile te for sleep they

40
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,320
still won't get any sleep it's all

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,360
 just as I have a bone to pick

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399
with the healthcare industrial complex

43
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,680
so too do I have a bone to pick with the

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,439
supplement industrial complex let's do a

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,719
real life example using the firstman

46
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,320
supplement yesterday I made a community

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,759
post asking what's wrong with the

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,159
supplement and you my audience delivered

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,159
I am proud of you and I expect nothing

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,600
less first The Good the supplement

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,399
contains Boron also contains iodine to

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,479
balance out the Boron that's a good move

53
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,560
second the bad the L citrine dose is too

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,560
small to make any difference oh well

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,120
whatever the ugly why is there MAA tonad

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,360
Al ashwagandha and Tribulus in the same

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,400
supplement but that's even not my

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,920
problem the biggest problem for me is a

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,680
dosage of black pepper extract the

60
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,560
reason for black pepper extract is to

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,640
increase the absorption of everything

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
else in the supplement but how does it

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,879
accomplish this it does so by negating

64
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
the detoxification benefits of the liver

65
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,680
to be clear I think first man tried to

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,599
make the best supplement that he could

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,560
he just didn't have the knowledge of the

68
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,760
hormone engine this supplement does not

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,239
show a systemic understanding of the

70
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,560
underlying biology instead it's just a

71
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,239
collection of the trendiest ingredients

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,879
on Google Trends in one capsule listen

73
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,760
you don't need any of these these

74
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,400
supplements do not address root causes

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,560
they promise quick fixes where instead

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,680
you should be thinking in system so how

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,239
do you think in systems well this is

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,799
part one of a five module course you'll

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,080
have at the end of it you'll have a

80
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,799
grand picture of the hormone engine in a

81
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,200
way that even first man did not many of

82
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,720
the herbal supplements like ashwag

83
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,640
gandha and tonat Ali that you saw in the

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,159
first man supplement are not even

85
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,440
supplements these are actually medicines

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,400
which were administered centuries ago

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,439
under the direct supervision by a shaman

88
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,840
these are powerful adaptogens that can

89
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,840
actually screw things up in the long

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,159
term of course they don't tell you this

91
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,400
then there's the other supplements that

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,920
getting popularity stuff like pine

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,799
pollen and antler velvet what they don't

94
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,480
tell you here is that a good night's

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,400
sleep that you to give you more benefits

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
than a $100 supplement many influencers

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,319
site scientific studies to back up their

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,360
claims about these weird supplements but

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,959
it's mostly none of these

100
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,200
people actually know how to read the

101
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,560
scientific literature and actually

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,159
compare the facts and it shows like for

103
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,519
pine pollen the major study that they

104
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,360
keep citing is done on fish and when it

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,000
comes to the deer antler velvet did you

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,319
know that antler velvet is actually used

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,040
to monitor the lead levels in the forest

108
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,760
literally forestry teams will go into

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,680
the woods and find this antler velvet

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
and use it to track the amount of lead

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
exposure in the environment so unless

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,639
the sourcing is perfect it actually do

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,960
more harm than good now we make fun of

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,160
the traditional Chinese for eating Rhino

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,440
horn or tiger dick to get a boner now

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
it's the same psychology how is this any

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,240
different the same with with a bit

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,919
of scientific wrapping around it another

119
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,960
example stinging nettle yes it increases

120
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,639
testosterone but it drops DHT not good

121
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,600
for pine pollen let's say there's enough

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,759
phyto testosterone in there for it to be

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,280
viable and let's say that we can absorb

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,199
it through our gut which again big if

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,600
should we actually take it here's the

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
Paradox either it is strong enough to

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
make a big difference in which case you

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
should not take it because it's likely

129
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,840
to downregulate your natural

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,039
testosterone production or it's too weak

131
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,720
to notice in which case why spend the

132
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,320
money I see guys freaking out when they

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,000
touch a receipt I see guys losing sleep

134
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,440
because they're so anxious about

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,320
optimizing their sleep I thought that

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,479
Health would be something that makes men

137
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,919
more robust but instead what's happened

138
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,400
is this hyperfixation on health has

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,840
actually made men more fragile I don't

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,759
like this phenomenon you must understand

141
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,319
health is not the goal health is the

142
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,560
foundation upon which to build an

143
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,759
amazing life you are not maxing

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,360
testosterone by being a hypochondriac

145
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,440
health nut with a drawer full of

146
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,120
supplements stop taking this weird

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,160
unless you actually know what you're

148
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,560
doing for example I had a a client and

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
he wanted me to help him increase his

150
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,520
testosterone okay I looked at his blood

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,360
work and his estrogen was too high I

152
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,520
asked him what supplements he was taking

153
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,960
he was taking the standard stuff you

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,199
know creatine whatever he was also

155
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,319
taking DHEA and pronone these are the

156
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,039
precursor molecules to testosterone so

157
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
he had heard online that taking these

158
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,280
precursors would help him support his

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
natural testosterone production but no

160
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,960
his body was just aromatizing all this

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,599
precursor to make more estrogen

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,599
eventually yes we fixed him we're able

163
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,720
to get him to a healthy 500 plus

164
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,199
nanogram per Des testosterone get him

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,560
lean and mean but my point here is got

166
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,599
to focus on the basics Excellence is

167
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,720
just the fundamentals done 100% of the

168
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,199
time to drive the point home I want to

169
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,319
scroll through some of these physique

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,199
updates in my communities everybody's

171
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,080
jacked to the gills and they're all just

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,919
fundamentalists they don't it's not that

173
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,520
they don't use supplements is that they

174
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,479
don't take their eyes off the

175
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,400
fundamentals now are all supplements

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,319
 of course not there are some

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
supplement systems that are genuinely

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,720
powerful I'll show these to you but I

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,639
want to make the disclaimer that none of

180
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,039
this is medical advice it's going to be

181
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,120
dependent on your specific biology the

182
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,440
first good supplement system is boron

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,800
paired with iodine so Boron frees up

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,360
testosterone from its deactivated State

185
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,240
and generates more testosterone overall

186
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,000
at any given time only 2% of your

187
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,319
testosterone is actually activated most

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
of it is bound to this spherical carrier

189
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,160
protein called

190
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,919
shbg ideally we can get the free

191
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,400
testosterone above

192
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,879
2.5% the reason I suggest Boron where I

193
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,879
didn't mention zinc selenium or copper

194
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,000
simply because you can't get Boron from

195
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,280
food Boron is only naturally found in

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
some places on Earth like Greece and the

197
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,599
Middle East and these are the results of

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,479
long ago meteor strikes that predate

199
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,199
mankind begs the interesting question

200
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,280
Greece and Turkey and the Middle East in

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,400
general the Fertile Crescent are the

202
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,280
birthplaces of civilization the Persian

203
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,879
Empire of the zarrian the Assyrians and

204
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,520
the Babylonians the Trojans and the

205
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,840
Mesopotamians the um Hittites the

206
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,720
Phoenicians the Sumerians the acadians

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,240
in Greece we have of course the

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,000
legendary molossians the Athenians the

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,120
Spartans the atrans and the Corinthians

210
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,919
if you go even more north of Greece

211
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,479
you'll find the Brave thians and you'll

212
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,960
find of course a legendary of

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,039
macedonians who produced Alexander the

214
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,199
Great could it be that these meteor

215
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,159
strikes and the resulting Boron deposit

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,479
had a role to play in the history of

217
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,560
these tribes were the testosterone

218
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,960
levels of these men in these areas

219
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,759
boosted by the Boron causing them to

220
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,360
have a shift in their behavior and their

221
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,039
values as an entire Society accelerating

222
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,879
these tribes into the pages of History

223
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,120
worth studying also worth studying is

224
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,919
the opposite what happens if our tribes

225
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,720
in in the modern time lose testosterone

226
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,360
does this change values at a ital level

227
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,959
which well has negative consequences in

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,760
the game of History again word studying

229
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,320
by regarding Boron as a supplement Boron

230
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,479
is a powerful goitrogen which means that

231
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,640
you need to be pairing it with iodine to

232
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,240
balance it in terms of dosage 6 Mig of

233
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,839
boron is what I do plus two drops of

234
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,920
Lugal solution which is an iodine Source

235
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,640
two drops of 2% Lugal solution I should

236
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,760
say pairing Boron with iodine optimizes

237
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,519
testosterone as well as a thyroid

238
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,320
hormones this is an example of a

239
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,880
synergistic supplement system Boron on

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,680
its own would not be advisable but when

241
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,399
you pair it with iodine now it's a

242
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,720
Powerhouse balancing zinc with copper is

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,160
another example because zinc can

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
actually deplete copper in fact the um

245
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,399
firstman supplement you have a bunch of

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,720
zinc but you didn't have copper to

247
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,399
balance it out with in fact every

248
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,200
supplement I mentioned will be paired

249
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,160
with its counterpart to create a Synergy

250
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,040
now we go to vitamin D vitamin D is not

251
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,399
a vitamin it's just a hormone and it's

252
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,720
very valuable to supplement because

253
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,720
because we spend most of our days

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
indoors especially in the colder

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,079
climates now to be clear if you're

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
getting 30 minutes plus of direct

257
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,839
sunlight on your bare skin you don't

258
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,440
need supplementation I've been able to

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,399
leverage my biology to be able to build

260
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,240
a business that affords me the ability

261
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,240
to live in Hawaii so I don't need

262
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,079
Vitamin D supplementation but of course

263
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,200
I lived for almost a decade in uh West

264
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,440
Lafia at Indiana studying biosciences

265
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,760
and college so I know what it feels like

266
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,000
when the sky turned gray and you haven't

267
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,800
seen the Sun for like 3 months 6 months

268
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,920
even the winters tend to depress

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,519
testosterone and dopamine and you can

270
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,440
mitigate some of its effects with

271
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,440
vitamin D if you're taking vitamin D you

272
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,880
should pair it with vitamin K because

273
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,600
these two again have a synergistic

274
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,279
effect and the reason for this is D and

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
K balance each other with respect to

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,839
calcium intake together they can make

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
your bones insanely strong powerful for

278
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,240
martial arts and Military regarding the

279
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,720
dosage I actually have Revisited my

280
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,760
thoughts on vitamin D A lot over the

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,440
past years and now again it's not

282
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,160
medical advice but what I would do if I

283
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,959
was in a position where I did need

284
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,519
supplementation was to go 10,000 IU per

285
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,279
day yes the number sounds like a lot but

286
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,120
in terms of the actual biological

287
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,279
effects it's not that uh outrageous till

288
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,680
10,000 IU is what I would personally do

289
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,839
now we come to King creatine it's safe

290
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,000
it's cheap it's more efficacious than

291
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
99% of supplements out there that are 10

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
times the price when we think of creatin

293
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,320
we think of gains in the gym but it's

294
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,800
way more than that it's truly a

295
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,920
mitochondrial support supplement and

296
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,839
wherever does mitochondria creatine can

297
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,800
work its magic yes muscle cells do

298
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,000
contain mitochondria so creatine can

299
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,279
help you lift more volume but the brain

300
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,480
neurons actually have more mitochondria

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,480
concentration this means that the actual

302
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,279
benefit of creatine is actually in the

303
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,560
cognitive benefits in fact if you look

304
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,560
at the scientific literature there's

305
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,600
more work done on Creatine as an

306
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,480
anti-aging agent or reversing cognitive

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,120
decline than even the gym stuff highly

308
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,200
valuable supplement you can parir

309
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,399
creatine by the way with methylene blue

310
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,880
to create another supplement system both

311
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,560
supplements work on mitochondria but

312
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,480
they're completely different overlapping

313
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Pathways just to be clear you can

314
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,399
absolutely use each of them separately

315
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,040
it's just up to you whether you want to

316
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
pair them up creatin directly helps

317
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,800
amino acid synthesis it lowers oxidative

318
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,360
stress and it converts testosterone to

319
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,040
DHT ah but DHT DHT causes hair loss so

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,079
should you take creatine if you're

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,920
afraid of hair loss so here's the deal

322
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,680
creatine only causes hair loss if you

323
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,040
have a DHT receptor in your hair

324
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,279
follicles that is to say a sensitive DHT

325
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,880
receptor in your hair follicles so how

326
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,240
would you know this either you can take

327
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,160
a DNA test and it'll straight up say you

328
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,320
have the gene for hair loss or you can

329
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,519
just try the creatine and as you are

330
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,079
showering your hair if you find that

331
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,399
more hair is coming off just stop taking

332
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,040
the creatine and you'll just regrow your

333
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,480
hair follicles you'll get your hair back

334
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,639
so it's up to you the trade-off that you

335
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,000
want to make do you want to have the DHT

336
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,160
or do you want to have the hair and

337
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,959
that's not something that I can

338
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,519
recommend you that's up to you now we

339
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
come back to the herbal supplements

340
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,480
these get a lot of hype on the internet

341
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,800
tonat Ali foda aesus however you say it

342
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,560
ashwagandha and the rest these are to be

343
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,680
seen as medicine for example if you have

344
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,880
a date lined up then if you take ton cut

345
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,240
early in the morning might lead to some

346
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,399
pleasant surprises later on if you know

347
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,959
what I mean so it's very situational

348
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,399
these are medicines these are not

349
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
supplements in the sense that you don't

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,240
take them on a day-by-day basis

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
ashwagandha is also very situational it

352
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,519
has the ability to numb stress so if you

353
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,120
have a big project coming up and you

354
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,720
have you know that you're going to be

355
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,279
stressed out you know that you're going

356
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,160
to have sleepless nights then ashwag

357
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:17,320
Ganda can dull the stress response it'll

358
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,800
also dull any happiness response so it's

359
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,880
one of those things where if you know

360
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
you're going to have to grind it out and

361
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,959
there's no source of Happiness anyway it

362
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
makes sense to D everything and go

363
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,399
hardcore work mode I personally don't do

364
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,760
this I instead rely on other me methods

365
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,760
for dealing with stress which I will

366
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,360
build up in the fifth module of this

367
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,120
course now what about the basic

368
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,399
micronutrients for testosterone like

369
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,959
zinc selenium copper I don't think you

370
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,760
need to supplement with any of these I

371
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,680
think you can get these from diet so red

372
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,399
meat and eggs contain all of these and

373
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,040
More in more bioavailable forms if you

374
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,720
can't get red meat then just double down

375
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,199
on the eggs you can have like eight eggs

376
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
per day that's all the micronutrients

377
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,440
you'll need you don't have to spend

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,759
money on zinc and whatnot at the end of

379
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,519
the day the key point I'm trying to

380
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,639
drive here is that health is a system of

381
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,880
interlocking systems so if you think

382
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
that buying the next latest and greatest

383
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,519
supplement is going to change your life

384
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,480
you are mistaken before I close out this

385
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,800
video we must zoom out what is it that

386
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,759
we are trying to achieve with these

387
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,199
supplements in the first place what's

388
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,160
the dream outcome for you what does your

389
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,079
dream lifestyle look like what would you

390
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,959
be working on if you knew you couldn't

391
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,680
fail don't sacrifice for your dreams

392
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,680
your dreams become the sacrifice
