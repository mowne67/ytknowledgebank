1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,359
I'm a simple man if it's good enough for

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,640
wice Gera it's good enough for me I've

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,240
been schoning raw eggs for the past 2

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
years or more one raw egg in the morning

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,360
one raw egg at night and on top of that

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,600
I'll have hardboiled eggs with the shell

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,400
on and this is exactly what Bruce Lee

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,400
did so you see these shells are pure

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,160
calcium and they are massively

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
beneficial for tooth Health by tooth

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
sensitivity issues are completely gone

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,560
but you say what about the Sal Manilla

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,039
risk what about food poisoning if you

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,119
schlunk them raw and what about the bio

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,640
deficiency a lot of people might have

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,480
heard that if you have raw eggs it's

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,280
going to cause biotin deficiency and I'm

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,879
going to answer all these questions and

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,680
more in this video you see most people

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,520
don't know this but Factory farmed eggs

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,680
come from a result of animal torture

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,320
these Factory farmed they starve these

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,079
birds for weeks on and stress them out

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,199
they start losing their plumage so their

25
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,280
feathers and this is a process called

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
forced multing and after this they

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
manipulate the artificial lights to kind

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,239
of stress them more and make them think

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
it's always daytime so after this forced

30
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,560
molting period which is torture on its

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,240
own they're laying a lot of eggs per day

32
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
and really big eggs so from a

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,000
productivity standpoint from an output

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,000
standpoint it makes sense which is why

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,479
it's legal in the US this practice is

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,479
completely illegal in India UK and the

37
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,880
EU it's no surprise that these highly

38
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,439
stressed diseased chickens are laying

39
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,280
eggs which have bacterial contamination

40
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,759
this is the same story as with cows if

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,320
you pump cows full of hormones and

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,840
destroy their immune system then of

43
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,640
course their milk is going to be

44
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,880
contaminated requiring pasteurization

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,799
but coming back to eggs it's not the egg

46
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,159
itself that's the danger it's not the

47
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,240
egg itself that's toxic it's more so the

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
farming practices so I'll prove this to

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,600
you in Japan right in Japan it's

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,600
actually very very common to have eggs

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,119
Raw it's a part of their regular

52
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,759
breakfast they'll just take an egg raw

53
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,759
break it over some rice and that's

54
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
breakfast there's not this huge hysteria

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,479
or fear around raw eggs there and the

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
reason is that they have better

57
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,479
standards and for that reason I do not

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,280
fear food poisoning risk with with eggs

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,680
because I'm purchasing the best quality

60
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,560
eggs there is this is pasturised non-

61
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,959
GMO egg so these H have been living

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,680
their best life out in nature eating

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
insects small lizards they get carrot

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,519
they get all kinds of different stuff

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
and they're healthy chickens living out

66
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,040
in the sunlight so these eggs have a lot

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,480
of vitamin D and because they're not

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,800
immune compromised these eggs don't have

69
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,879
the same level of risk as a lowquality

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,959
factory farmed eggs that being said

71
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,239
should you consume wrong eggs I cannot

72
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,319
make the decision for you and I don't

73
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,080
make any recommend recomendations in

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,080
this

75
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,840
video also you got to think about what

76
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,360
the chicken themselves are eating if

77
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,760
your chicken is grain Fed so you're

78
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,159
buying lowquality eggs grain fed chicken

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,480
are fed with basically low quality corn

80
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,680
and lowquality soybean both of which are

81
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,840
likely contaminated with zaa which is a

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,680
mold estrogen and of course soy contains

83
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,760
phytoestrogens so you're eating an

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,720
estrogen bomb if you're eating

85
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,200
lowquality egg on the other hand if

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
you're eating high quality eggs like

87
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,959
what this is you're getting the best in

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,440
terms of B vitamins protein literally

89
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,120
everything which brings us to biotin raw

90
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,760
egg whites can create a biotin

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,480
deficiency a lot of you might have heard

92
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,959
that if you eat eggs Raw it's actually

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,360
not that good for you because the egg

94
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
albumin it contains something called

95
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,920
avidin which is a protein and this

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,680
avidin it it binds to Biotin and biotin

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,640
is a B vitamin it's very required for

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,280
the body for healthy functioning and the

99
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,400
idea is because it's aidin is binding to

100
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,920
biotin it doesn't get absorbed by our

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,439
stomach our digestive system I should

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,360
say and therefore cooked eggs are better

103
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,040
than raw eggs because avidin is

104
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,480
destroyed by the process of cooking but

105
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,959
this doesn't really track because

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,159
cooking only destroys up to 60% of the

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,720
avidin in eggs anyway so even if you do

108
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,400
cook your eggs you're still getting 40%

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
of evidence so cooking isn't even that

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,920
effective as destroying evidence and

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,200
also biotin deficiency is very uncommon

112
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,840
especially in fact it's impossible to

113
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,439
get a biotin deficiency if you're on an

114
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,959
animal-based diet unless you have some

115
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,239
kind of genetic predisposition so no

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,720
you're not going to get biotin

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,840
deficiency because you eat raw eggs now

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,280
the concern around salmonella or food

119
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,640
poisoning that's fair enough that's a

120
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,680
risk assessment that you have to make

121
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,280
but the concern around biotin deficiency

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,000
is not realistic in my opinion that

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
concern only exists if you're schoning

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,840
like whole cartons of raw eggs every day

125
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,040
and the thing is you can see biotin

126
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,040
deficients coming it's not like a

127
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,280
surprise event biotin deficiency you're

128
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,440
going to lose skin quality you're going

129
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,919
to lose hair quality and my hair and

130
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
skin quality have only gotten better

131
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,960
with time but I'm sure that I don't have

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,040
any kind of bioin

133
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,520
deficiency and if you choose to have raw

134
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,759
eggs when should you have them I

135
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,280
personally have them one in the morning

136
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,360
and one at night before I sleep so

137
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,120
that's right I have Incorporated a small

138
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,639
breakfast into my routine I've

139
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,320
experimented with different things I

140
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,360
found that one fruit usually a kiwi plus

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,759
one raw egg works

142
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,840
amazingly now is there any benefits of

143
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,160
raw egg versus cooked eggs no I don't

144
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,919
think so it's just a matter of

145
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
preference for me at least so what I'll

146
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,199
do is it depends okay first off it

147
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
depends how you break the egg because

148
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,919
that's also a massive counter to any

149
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,360
salmonella risk so I'm going to show you

150
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,280
that and like I said it's just a matter

151
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,280
of convenience I don't want to take out

152
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,360
time to boil an egg or make an omelette

153
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,240
sometimes in the morning I just want to

154
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
get my nutrition in Fast and I really

155
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,039
try to minimalize my morning routine as

156
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,280
much as possible literally it's three

157
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,759
things first Sal second sunshine and

158
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,759
three shower so literally wake up of

159
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,919
course use the bathroom go outside get

160
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,960
some sunshine into my eyes come back in

161
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,199
have some electrolytes and third go and

162
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
have a shower it doesn't even have to be

163
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,960
a cold shower just a regular shower will

164
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,400
do and then I'll come to my kitchen

165
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,039
schlank an egg have a kiwi and my day

166
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,639
starts I should also say especially in

167
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,919
Winter you want to incorporate eggs in

168
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,360
your diet for the Vitamin D benefit of

169
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,800
course you're always choosing pasture

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
raised and you're never going to have

171
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
your regular store-bought styrofoam

172
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
[ __ ] eggs again in your

173
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,520
life so how do you break an egg easy do

174
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,720
not use a fork to smash your eggshells

175
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,400
do not use a sharp corner to break your

176
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,199
eggshell because what happens is when

177
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,039
you do that the fragments of eggshell

178
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,160
will actually shoot into the egg and

179
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,600
could potentially contaminate the egg or

180
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,240
at the very least now you have a sharp

181
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,039
piece inside your mouth so much better

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,080
way to do it is just a FL flat surface

183
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,639
so like this table take the

184
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,039
egg brisk tap you'll have you'll have

185
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,319
like a what do you call it like a

186
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,680
depression right you'll have a

187
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
depression the membrane behind the shell

188
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,960
is still intact so it's not going to

189
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,759
leak at this point so you have the

190
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,199
depression you just bring it over your

191
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,720
um you know your cup whatever it is use

192
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,319
your thumbs to just divide the egg and

193
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,280
it'll pour out and you've basically

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,880
minimized any chance of the egg touching

195
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,319
the the shell cuz it's usually the shell

196
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,440
if it contains any bacteria it's going

197
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,440
to be on the shell not inside the egg so

198
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,720
my shell did not really touch the

199
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,840
albumen doesn't really touch the yolk so

200
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,400
we have pure egg albumen and yolk in in

201
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,479
this cup and it's just a matter of

202
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,479
schlunk it's just like a taking a

203
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,319
shot there we have it Egg Long right so

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,080
how much time did that take maybe 30

205
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,199
seconds at most and then I'll have a

206
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,639
kiwi or a banana but whatever your fruit

207
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,759
you choose make sure that you actually

208
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,080
wash it well with either 10% salt

209
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,160
solution or apple cider vinegar 10%

210
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,960
solution so that any of the pesticides

211
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,120
and insecticides are removed from the

212
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,360
surface of the fruit so cholesterol

213
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,680
which eggs have cholesterol cholesterol

214
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,720
is what transforms into either

215
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,879
testosterone or cortisol or a a number

216
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,000
of different hormones but let's talk

217
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,240
about these two I want to bias the

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,599
formation of testosterone over cortisol

219
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,599
and having a small little breakfast in

220
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,440
the morning lowers your stress and

221
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,919
allows your body to do just that on top

222
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,199
of that eggs are important for another

223
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,360
reason so eggs contain sulfur and sulfur

224
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,560
can bind to and neutralize Unbound iron

225
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,280
in your blood this is important because

226
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,199
you don't want Unbound iron in your

227
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,680
blood it's a whole different topic of

228
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,159
course it has to do with heavy metal

229
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,400
toxicity but if you want a full course

230
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,080
like a full course on every single detox

231
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,879
topic imaginable everything from emfs

232
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,039
all the way to parasites and of course

233
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,199
xenoestrogens and everything else then I

234
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,960
do have that course ready down

235
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,840
below and speaking of eating eggs with

236
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,639
the shell on is this something worth

237
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,639
doing yes but this is after hard boiling

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
and that's because you're actually

239
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,599
eating the shell and the shell could be

240
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
contaminated so yeah you absolutely want

241
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,039
to boil the shell before you eat the

242
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
whole thing and how often should you eat

243
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,360
the Shell with the egg at least once a

244
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
week just eat the whole damn egg it's

245
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,479
not that bad you can you can eat this I

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,159
mean like this one is not boiled

247
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,960
obviously it's just from the carton but

248
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,159
if I boil this egg I will smash it I'll

249
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,759
smash it whole with the shell for the

250
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,080
calcium benefits 100% legit Bruce Lee

251
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
did it all the time if it's good enough

252
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,479
for Bruce Le is good enough for you and

253
