1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
welcome to the 30-day brain reset we're

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,759
going to be doing the esoteric

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,320
meditation protocol instead of watching

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,240
a video and then executing on what I say

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
we'll actually do this together all you

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,679
have to do is put your headphones in or

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,359
have your speakers on and just follow

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,800
along with the

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,240
instructions phase one of the esoteric

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,600
meditation protocol is the setup we

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,279
don't want to do meditation in a

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,519
disordered environment because the

13
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,760
external does reflect the internal we

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,840
want to clean up our environment as much

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,880
as we can Within reason you don't have

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,680
to do complete you know overhaul of your

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,320
room just make sure that the egregious

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
disorder is under control make sure

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,360
there's no clothes lying on the ground

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,520
make sure the trash is not overflowing

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,239
just make sure your room is relatively

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,280
within control the second piece is to

23
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,920
grab a notebook and a pen this is going

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
to be a meditation Journal you don't

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,640
have to do a lot of writing it's just

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,160
good to have a piece of paper with you

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,800
when you're meditating because often

28
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,519
times your brain will give you genuinely

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,719
creative thoughts you'll have awesome

30
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,600
business ideas you'll have creative you

31
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,040
know video ideas whatever it is that you

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,799
do as your job it very easily removes

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,520
you from the meditative State because

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,040
now you're thinking that you need to

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
execute on that idea as soon as you're

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
done meditating and that just gets you

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,200
out of the awareness state so it found

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,600
it very beneficial to just have a

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,079
notebook and a pen near me so if I have

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,400
a really good idea I'll open my eyes jot

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,680
down my idea and then continue with the

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,159
meditation in the knowledge that that

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,479
idea is now preserved and I don't have

44
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,920
to expand more brain energy trying to

45
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,960
store it

46
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,079
all right boys we're in the stress test

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
component of this there's really no good

48
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,960
way to record this so this is what we're

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,720
going to do all right so I just wanted

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,640
to show you what the stress test is so

51
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,640
in this esoteric meditation protocol we

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
want to combine the physical and the

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,600
mental right we want to actually stress

54
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,560
ourselves physically easiest way to do

55
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,200
this is Max push-ups in 1 minute this is

56
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,159
not going to affect your recovery you

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,360
can absolutely work out and lift weights

58
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,880
and everything completely unimpeded by

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,079
this this is just a one minute hardcore

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
how many push-ups can you do in one

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,759
minute type challenge so you literally

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,239
have your phone have my timer on this so

63
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,120
as soon as I hit start I'm going to

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,040
start cranking these push-ups out and

65
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,239
I'm not going to stop until the 1 minute

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,080
expires it's enough stress that'll get

67
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,200
my fight ORF flight response it'll get

68
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,640
my stress up it'll get my muscle to be

69
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,160
um met metabolically stressed it'll get

70
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,080
my heart rate up it'll get my breathing

71
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,560
up that's all I really need for this so

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,560
hit start and

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,440
then feeling the

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,879
burn still got 30 seconds left

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm going down on every single rep and

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,360
if I don't touch the floor with my chest

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,360
it doesn't count

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,920
all right that's 60 seconds that's a

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,760
minute of work so what do I do now

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,200
obviously my breath has increased heart

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,920
rate's

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:52,680
increased and that's good I'll sit

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,560
down and I'll meditate obviously I'm not

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,480
going to do a good job of narrating a

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,439
guided meditation in this state so we'll

86
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,439
skip back to our audio I'll guide you

87
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,000
from there youve just finished your

88
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,120
stress test you've had your calisthenics

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,959
now your breathing is heavy your heart

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,720
is beating and you might even feel the

91
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,200
burn in your muscles excellent that

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,799
brings you into the present and that

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,199
brings you into your physical body and

94
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,680
your physical Sensations the only thing

95
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,199
which exists is the present so now it's

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,080
really good that your attention is

97
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,520
completely in the now so what we do now

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,600
is a session of spherical awareness and

99
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,280
that's what I'm going to guide you in

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,280
right right now so go ahead and sit down

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
and however is comfortable for you you

102
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,039
can sit on the floor if you want or on a

103
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,120
cushion or on a chair it doesn't matter

104
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,400
just have your back straight and just be

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,400
comfortable sit down I know that your

106
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,919
heart is pounding and you know your

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,919
breath is ragged and it doesn't really

108
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,840
feel like a meditation session at all

109
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,360
that's the whole point now we change our

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,919
mindset we change our mindset from this

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,440
attack mode from this push-ups mode from

112
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,199
this performance mode into relaxation so

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,320
now that you're sitting down just listen

114
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,759
to the prompts and do what I'm

115
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,720
instructing in this audio

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,360
guide bring your attention to your

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,039
breath notice the rapidity of your

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,479
breathing and the loudness of your

119
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,880
heartbeat feel the air entering through

120
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,960
your nose feeling your lungs and then

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,160
leaving your body breathe with the belly

122
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,680
and not your chest close your eyes

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,520
attempt to bring the breathing and the

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,240
heart rate down through deep

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,240
diaphragmatic

126
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,080
breathing now we're going to be doing a

127
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,160
deep inhale and a hold so deep inhale

128
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,880
until your lungs are full to bursting

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,000
and as you release open your eyes and

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,319
expand your peripheral vision you're

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,960
suddenly taking the entire field of

132
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,599
vision not focusing on one object when

133
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,199
you're in attack mode your focus is on

134
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,639
one thing when you're in relaxed mode

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,160
you have this deep peripheral vision

136
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,960
where you're aware of your entire

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,639
surroundings so now that's what you're

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,759
trying to do becoming aware of the edges

139
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,400
of your eyes sides just maximizing the

140
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,280
visual field your awareness of the full

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
field of vision is the key to this

142
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,440
meditation Style can blink as normal but

143
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,199
have an awareness of the F field of view

144
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,199
this keeps you in effortless

145
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,319
awareness at this phase of the

146
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,440
meditation just focus on the vision just

147
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,520
increase the perception that you can see

148
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,680
just increase the detail at which you

149
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,680
can

150
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
see e

151
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,599
now we're going to expand the auditory

152
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,120
field so the field of your hearing

153
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,639
you still have this vibrant awareness of

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,400
your eyesight your vision but you're

155
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,599
adding in the additional factor of our

156
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,360
ears our hearing our hearing sense

157
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,400
process an intimate detailed sounds

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,280
coming from within your own breath and

159
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,759
heartbeat and then expand that awareness

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,240
outwards in a

161
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,919
sphere we're beginning to have a

162
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,759
spherical awareness as we become

163
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,440
effortlessly aware of the immediate

164
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,440
surroundings

165
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,240
imagine your awareness expanding in all

166
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,959
directions forward backwards to the

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,880
sides and even upwards and downwards

168
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,680
imagine an aura of awareness forming a

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,959
sphere around you we're going to spend

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,200
the next few minutes just existing in

171
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,079
this calm awareness which has been

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
focused by the calesthenics work that we

173
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,320
just

174
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
did e

175
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,440
allow each breath to strengthen the

176
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,560
awareness of the sphere around you

177
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,000
imagine each exhale pulsing a wave of

178
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,000
power outwards

179
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,279
you may have noticed two main

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,240
differences between this kind of

181
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,959
meditation and any meditation that

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,760
you've done previously first we aren't

183
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,320
starting from a relaxed State we're

184
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,880
actually starting from the agitated

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,279
State and the second is instead of just

186
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,240
focusing on the breath and going inwards

187
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,240
we're actually expanding our awareness

188
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
outwards

189
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
e e

191
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,800
and now we come to the close of this

192
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,920
meditation take a few deep breaths in

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and out and feel how you are different

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,800
compared to when you began

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,199
now we begin to retract the sphere of

196
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,480
awareness back into the body close your

197
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,399
eyes and take a deep breath in and

198
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,120
imagine the sphere of awareness

199
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,240
Contracting inwards into the center of

200
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,240
your forehead it might take a couple

201
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,240
cycles of breath to fully contract this

202
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
awareness

203
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,079
now when you open your eyes you'll feel

204
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,040
the energy radiating within your body

205
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,279
