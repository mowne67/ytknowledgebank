1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
law number 11 complete garbage law two

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,600
utter garbage lost seven garbage this

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,700
book is so dumb that people actually

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,580
read this and take this seriously 48

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,440
Laws of Power 48 Laws of Power claims to

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,240
give you all the secrets all the

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,400
forbidden knowledge about how Society

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,199
actually works because you can use those

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,640
tools and get yourself to the top of

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,260
that social hierarchy in this video

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
we're going to explore is that true does

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,039
the 48 Laws actually help you get better

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,720
at the social game or does it have

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,640
fundamental flaws that might actually

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,840
hurt you more than it helps you and of

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,579
course whether you should read the book

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,920
at all the hype that this book is

18
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,440
receiving is just crazy there's people

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,880
who literally memorize the 48 Laws and

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,980
make note cards and try to learn them

21
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,600
there's a whole rap song about this book

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,340
how many books are popular enough or

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,899
have a cultural status enough to have a

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,640
whole rap song based on them the song is

25
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,980
actually pretty good but is this book

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,360
actually helpful is this book true in

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,399
the most fundamental sense does it

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,899
reflect Society like Robert Greene

29
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,399
claims so that's an interview and with

30
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,020
Jordan Peterson is interviewing Robert

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,820
Greene and he asks him what's your

32
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,280
motivation for creating this book and

33
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,719
don't Peterson explicitly says what's

34
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,700
your motivation for creating a

35
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,900
manipulative book and Green's reply this

36
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,159
is essentially it's it's not

37
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900
manipulative you know it's just

38
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,400
reflecting society as it is and people

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,380
need to know how Society actually works

40
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,060
well so the question is does this book

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,100
really reflect society as it works and

42
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,479
does it help you do better in your

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,580
social game and try to improve your

44
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,340
status I think not some of the advice in

45
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,960
this book is actively harming you I'll

46
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,240
give you an example law 12 is

47
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,340
essentially to use selective honesty

48
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,659
that just means lying if you read the

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,880
chapter he'll talk about how you should

50
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,680
omit certain things slash fabricate

51
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,360
other things in order to improve your

52
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,799
status in your social hierarchy and he

53
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,659
says to do this so that you're more

54
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,340
liked by people people trust you more

55
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,439
people think you're more kind he uses

56
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,180
this as a power tactic once you're seen

57
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
as a likable kind character because of

58
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,600
your manipulation slash lying you have

59
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,979
higher status in that group and people

60
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,140
trust you more and you have more

61
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,479
opportunities but this is garbage advice

62
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,520
and here's why people aren't dumb the

63
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,259
human species a human being is a social

64
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,759
creature and has evolved for a company

65
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,740
over thousands of years to interact in

66
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,500
this social Dynamic and just because

67
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,540
you've read this 1200 page book about

68
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,520
social game you know social dynamics it

69
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,020
doesn't mean the people around you are

70
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,520
dumb it doesn't mean that you're better

71
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,379
at understanding Society than they are

72
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
even if they aren't able to articulate

73
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,099
how social dynamics Works they're still

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
human beings they're still programmed by

75
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,879
Evolution to have an intuition for how

76
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
to interact with people so if you're

77
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,540
playing this game of you know lying

78
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,520
slash hiding truth in order to be kind

79
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,379
and more liked by people around you

80
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,000
people are going to pick up on this and

81
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,560
you cannot stay consistent for very long

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,239
they're going to be seeing you as a

83
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,220
snake a kind of person whose advice

84
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,800
slash compliments don't mean anything

85
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,959
that will actually harm you this 48 Laws

86
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,280
of Power mindset the idea that you know

87
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,599
you're in some kind of like Game of

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Thrones setting in which you're trying

89
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,319
to manipulate and handle people you have

90
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,540
to understand that everybody's playing

91
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,180
the game and this book might actively

92
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,519
make your game worse by giving you bad

93
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,680
tactics there is such a thing as a bad

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,420
book let me explain so the idea that

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,459
watching Tick Tock for too long is bad

96
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,200
for you makes you less successful that's

97
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,519
pretty much accepted you know we have

98
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,140
this understanding that certain video

99
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,540
content might be actively harming you

100
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,000
but we think books and reading is just

101
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,519
always good that is not true just as

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,159
there is bad video content there's also

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,540
bad ideas in books I think that 48 Laws

104
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,920
has a lot of bad ideas I'm not saying

105
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,239
the entire book is bad I'm not saying

106
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,980
it's a worthless book or anything like

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,440
that but it has a lot of bad ideas which

108
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,840
you need to identify for example law 2

109
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,280
says never put too much trust in your

110
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
friends think about what kind of a bad

111
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,580
mindset that is you should be able to

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
trust some people in your life if you

113
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,459
live a life in which you cannot really

114
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,260
trust anybody including your closest

115
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,480
friends then you're losing out on power

116
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,040
so this entire book's premise is to give

117
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,720
you these tactics in order to make you

118
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,000
the most socially powerful person that

119
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,040
you can possibly be but trust has power

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,140
to it if you have one or two friends

121
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,239
Brothers you're close with them and you

122
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,519
can trust them implicitly that gives you

123
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
a level of power over the guy who has no

124
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,420
friends and he's the Lone Wolf kind of

125
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
guy so Robert Green is just wrong in

126
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,840
this maybe he never had any friends and

127
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,400
that's why he writes this maybe he got

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
betrayed by his friend but the fact of

129
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,580
the matter is is throughout history

130
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,440
friendships strong friendships strong

131
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,819
brotherhoods have always existed and in

132
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,620
fact these were the precursor to

133
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,700
achieving great things so if you neglect

134
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,500
friends who you can actually trust

135
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,640
you're Australia missing out on the

136
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,200
maximum amount of power that you're

137
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,239
capable of regardless of whether this is

138
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
manipulation or not having friends is

139
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,320
objectively useful even if you are just

140
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,600
using to use your friends to get you to

141
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,820
the next level so law two other garbage

142
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
law seven let others do the work and

143
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,759
take the credit you shouldn't do this I

144
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,199
don't know why I have to say this but

145
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,220
this book is so dumb that people

146
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,139
actually read this and take this

147
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,699
seriously firstly you do want to do the

148
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,259
work because doing the work for whatever

149
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,940
it is that you're trying to improve on

150
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,020
actually makes you better so you

151
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,940
shouldn't just let other people do the

152
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,500
work that's part one second part is if

153
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,000
you take all the credit and don't give

154
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,620
credit to your team people who have

155
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
helped you along the way you will not be

156
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,919
able to have them help you the second

157
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,600
time and the third time fourth time two

158
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,759
they will resent you and you will have

159
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,380
made enemies and these enemies know you

160
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,940
they know your weaknesses so you've made

161
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,680
enemies who have intimate knowledge of

162
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,479
your weaknesses why would you do such a

163
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
thing that objectively lowers your power

164
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,600
level thirdly I don't think this

165
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,280
actually helps if you have have gained a

166
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,139
lot more success and you don't share

167
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,460
your success with the credit to your

168
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,020
team and the people who are brought you

169
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,540
there you don't actually gain anything

170
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,400
in fact you actually gain by showing the

171
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,080
world your team and how they've helped

172
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,460
you because that builds authenticity and

173
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,620
people actually like you more for having

174
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,199
done so so this law is complete garbage

175
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,880
law number 11 learn to keep people

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,380
dependent on you this is the most

177
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,360
blatant power play right you want to

178
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,800
have people depending on you so that can

179
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,680
have them do what you want them to do

180
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,660
but firstly this is very very specific

181
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,280
in context the only times this applies

182
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,780
is say you are working a nine-to-five

183
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,580
job and you really want to keep that job

184
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,560
and you want your company to never fire

185
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,300
you perhaps you should work hard slash

186
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,100
make yourself indispensable such that

187
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,419
the company is dependent on you to some

188
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,560
extent and you know if you have job

189
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,820
security something like something like

190
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,620
this that's a good example of how this

191
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,780
law can apply but more often than not

192
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,340
you don't want people to be depending on

193
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,900
you for everything for example if you're

194
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,100
running a business you actually want to

195
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,539
train your employees to kind of take

196
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,860
care of things themselves make their own

197
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,840
decisions and help run your company

198
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,520
otherwise you're just going to be always

199
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,660
having to manage everybody so even in a

200
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
business business setting this law

201
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,440
doesn't really work imagine in a family

202
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,940
setting would you want your kids to be

203
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,740
always dependent on you that sounds like

204
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,180
a terrible way to raise kids you want

205
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,919
kids to be independent and make their

206
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,479
own decisions learn and grow and Thrive

207
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,740
without you so that once you're gone

208
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,960
they can do better than you so this

209
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,880
advice in business or family settings is

210
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,320
garbage even when it comes to friends so

211
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,060
you cannot really have a friendship when

212
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,800
the person is dependent on you for

213
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,539
something for example if your friend is

214
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
also your employee and they depend on

215
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,199
you or their salary it's not a real

216
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
friendship because you have power over

217
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,639
them a good friendship only happens when

218
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,740
neither parties need one another but

219
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,419
choose but choose to spend time with

220
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,800
each other slash interact with each

221
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,919
other that's what a friendship really is

222
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,199
so law 11 another garbage law law 24

223
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,660
another despicable law this says

224
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,120
essentially play the perfect courtier so

225
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,400
a courtier is the lowest possible life

226
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,500
form a courtier is a person who is a

227
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,660
hanger on like he's a like a companion

228
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,280
of a royal person like a companion of

229
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,900
the Queen the king so back in the day

230
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,160
the king and queen would just reside in

231
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,080
Dallas's and they would have a whole

232
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,360
bunch of courtesy years in the court in

233
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,300
the palace whose job was essentially to

234
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,500
exist to be a perfect courtier is the

235
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,300
stupidest thing you're going to Aspire

236
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,160
to courtiers didn't do anything they

237
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,600
didn't have a mission of purpose other

238
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,460
than the status game the only thing

239
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,319
which they lived for was the status game

240
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,240
how to improve their status in the

241
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
palace to get closer to the royalty and

242
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,419
didn't have any real power because the

243
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
king and queen would have real power so

244
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,000
is this something you really want to

245
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,620
Aspire to do you want to be a courtier

246
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,180
in life you know you want to Aspire to

247
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,680
be somebody without meaning and purpose

248
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,479
and actually creating something of your

249
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,560
own all you do is play the status game

250
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,180
try to be better than your friends

251
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,460
better than your family like what kind

252
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,319
of pointless fools errand is this this

253
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,599
book is preaching to you something which

254
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,520
is inherently in an undesirable outcome

255
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,860
but it's still a popular book so

256
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,539
hopefully this video gets views and then

257
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,840
people realize this book is full of

258
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:51,300
trash Lot 29 Lot 29 essentially says

259
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,560
plan all the way to the end dumb dumb

260
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,900
don't plan all the way to the end

261
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
planning is a little bit overestimated

262
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,360
well at least for me for me I find that

263
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,740
quite often I need to act and acute in

264
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,240
order to actually get things done I

265
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,800
easily fall into the Trap of just

266
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,360
planning and planning and planning and

267
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
not actually getting the work done to

268
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,120
actually meet the goal so this is

269
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,740
probably a law which is actually true

270
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,419
for some people I'd say there's people

271
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
who just jump into action and just start

272
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,419
doing things and perhaps they should

273
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
take a step back and plan things out

274
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,660
that's fair enough so this law does

275
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,919
apply I agree but for a lot of people I

276
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,960
believe that they get stuck in this

277
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,699
procrastination slash planning phase

278
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,440
without actually doing things so I would

279
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,120
rather say go and do things and then

280
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,139
learn along the way then just sit and

281
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,639
plan all the way to the end because

282
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,319
first off that's kind of pointless if

283
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,120
you plan all the way to the end and one

284
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,979
thing happens which kind of derails your

285
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,779
plan then you can't even bring that to

286
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,000
be rather you should have a strategy

287
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,039
tactics which get you closer to the end

288
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,360
goal piece by piece rather than planning

289
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,039
all the way to the end so that if

290
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,959
something happens which throws you off

291
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,519
track you have ways around it and then

292
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,320
you can get to your desired outcome so I

293
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,180
don't think you can plan to the end even

294
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,740
if you could you shouldn't but another

295
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,800
stupid law you know law 29 another

296
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,080
stupid law law 30. so law 30 says make

297
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,300
your wins seem effortless so the idea

298
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,399
behind this is yes you put in a lot of

299
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,620
effort in order to succeed but you hide

300
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,300
all the effort slash hard work and you

301
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,860
make it seem as though you just

302
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,480
succeeded you're just that good you're

303
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,160
just blessed by the gods and you're just

304
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
succeeding and then this creates this

305
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,180
Aura this Aura of success that people

306
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,920
see it and they're like in awe of your

307
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,240
success because they don't see the hard

308
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,100
work I don't think this is a good

309
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,500
strategy at least today because we

310
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,779
respect the hard work we know that any

311
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,820
degree of success requires effort so we

312
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,680
respect and like people more when

313
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,480
they're authentic and they reveal to us

314
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,220
their struggles and strategies on how

315
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,959
they got to their success so this law

316
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,760
goes both ways I mean I'm sure that some

317
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,620
people would benefit by hiding the

318
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,779
struggles but equally fifty percent

319
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,279
probably gain by revealing their

320
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,500
struggle so this law doesn't really

321
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,480
apply law 30 and other stupid law all

322
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,839
right final law I'm going to describe

323
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,279
law 33 discover each man's thumb screw

324
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,899
so thumb screw is essentially a torture

325
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,399
device what they're saying is find each

326
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,140
man's weakness so that you can control

327
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,480
slash manipulate him this is not good

328
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,800
advice because firstly you assume that

329
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,320
you're better than people around you

330
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,720
this is me may be true but probably not

331
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,880
true you're probably either average or

332
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,200
between average and the best so if you

333
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,300
have this idea that you want to find

334
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,920
people's pain Point press on them to

335
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,420
manipulate them to do things for you it

336
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,920
might succeed for people who have a

337
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,959
lower power level than you but it's

338
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,700
going to backfire terribly when you mess

339
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,019
with the wrong person because you're not

340
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,399
necessarily the smartest person on the

341
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,779
planet there are people who are smarter

342
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,220
than you very likely and people who are

343
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,600
better at making money slash having

344
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220
better connection you mess with the

345
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
wrong person by pressing their buttons

346
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,700
and manipulate them they will carry that

347
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,500
Grudge and they will do the same thing

348
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,600
to you effectively lowering your power

349
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,220
level so another law which is very

350
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,899
hazardous people who follow this book

351
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,640
they're setting themselves up for

352
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,500
massive social failure so the question

353
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,060
now is should you read the book you know

354
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,740
I spent the last minutes dissing the

355
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,720
book hating on this book going law after

356
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,760
law hating on it so should you read the

357
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,200
book yes you should read the book and

358
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,820
here's why firstly you shouldn't read

359
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,320
the full book because it's too long if

360
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,660
you read The Abridged version but anyway

361
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,899
you should read the book because it

362
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,220
tells you about how Robert Greene thinks

363
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,779
why is it important why do we want to

364
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,940
know how rubber green things it's

365
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,160
because there are mini Robert greens all

366
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,740
around us just many manipulation people

367
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,899
Petty tyrants snakes there are snakes

368
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,360
all around us so Robert Greene's book is

369
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,120
immensely helpful because he allows us

370
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,440
to identify snakes around us and avoid

371
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,060
them that's why you should read this

372
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,980
book as a defense mechanism against

373
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,019
people like Robert Greene but even

374
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,540
that's not completely true the book

375
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,519
essentially makes you cognizant of the

376
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,920
social game so that is an advantage of

377
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,200
reading this book so you have the bottom

378
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,700
tier Normie who doesn't understand how

379
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Society works at all and just goes

380
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,180
through life assuming everybody's good

381
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,200
and nobody cares about power this guy's

382
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,820
a dumbass he's never going to get

383
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,320
anywhere right and then if you read the

384
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
book you understand that there's games

385
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,220
being played in the background there are

386
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,839
things going on behind people people's

387
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,160
intentions aren't pure you know they are

388
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,079
doing things to improve their own status

389
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,760
in the world and that awareness itself

390
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,140
is useful so you reach to level two

391
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,459
you're better off than the bottom guy

392
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,899
and this book will get you there because

393
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,459
it reels to you a lot of truths about

394
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,959
human nature the dark truths and

395
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,399
everything but level two is not where

396
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,220
you want to be you want to read the book

397
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,980
understand its contents have the wisdom

398
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,480
to realize which rules are garbage avoid

399
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,519
those rules and understand that there

400
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,339
are people who do actually follow these

401
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,260
rules and then you go to level three to

402
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,600
actually play the social game right this

403
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,920
is a level of authenticity you see that

404
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,120
people are manipulative around you

405
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,440
there's a lot of snakes there's a lot of

406
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,959
people They're all playing status games

407
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,459
you see all this and you choose to be

408
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,680
different from them what I mean by this

409
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,720
is you choose to play a different game

410
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,360
than the status game you can choose

411
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,519
another game to play you can choose to

412
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,560
be authentic to yourself you can choose

413
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,959
to play the money game you can choose to

414
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,940
play the value game the value game is

415
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,100
essentially providing value to society

416
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,899
in exchange for that they give you money

417
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,760
and respect and status and everything

418
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,380
essentially what this book is trying to

419
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,420
give you this so there's two ways to

420
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,980
attain High status one is by playing the

421
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,240
social game well which is what this book

422
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,800
is about but the other way is actually

423
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
providing value to society in general

424
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,579
like actually doing something good for

425
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,959
society either it be through providing

426
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,060
you know some kind of good content

427
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,740
educated content or creating new

428
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,540
technology whatever it is you know find

429
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,279
your actual purpose and fulfill that

430
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,779
that gives you status and there's other

431
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,940
things too you know building a good

432
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,620
physique being healthy being well that

433
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,300
gives you status there's many many games

434
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,220
that you can play many many strategies

435
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,540
that you can do to get status you don't

436
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,399
have to play the social game to get

437
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,680
status and especially not the kind of

438
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,839
game which 48 Laws of Power is preaching

439
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,180
so I'd say read the book understand the

440
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,800
message and actively don't follow the

441
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,240
message that's my advice to you thank

442
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,740
you for watching and thank you to my

443
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,740
editor for editing this video goodbye
