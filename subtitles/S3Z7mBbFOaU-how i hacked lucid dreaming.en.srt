1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,600
I am going to show you how to do lucid

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,040
dreaming correctly there's a lot of

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,880
these methods online like wild and Mild

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,080
these are all trash I will show you the

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,080
right way how to do lucid dreaming and

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,520
in fact chemically indued lucid dreaming

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,119
using the lucid dreaming Elixir all

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,880
right so let me get my

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,279
marker all right boys so here's the

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,240
thing about lucid dreaming right first a

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,279
lot of people don't even believe that

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,000
it's true it is absolutely true and the

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,599
science actually backs this they did

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
three experiments which I can recall

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
which actually prove that it is true the

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
first experiment they ask these people

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,320
who claim to be lucid dreamers to

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,520
visualize a triangle and they take the

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,480
electrical impulses in an F fmri scan

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,280
and they ask them to dream when they're

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,000
sleeping and it's the same exact results

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,600
which they get proving that they have

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
control over their dreams and they can

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,079
visualize what they said they would

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,160
visualize another experiment which they

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,399
did is they told the scientists they

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,199
told the these lucid dreamers what

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,320
pattern to move their eyes while they're

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,520
dreaming and they tracked their eye

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
movements while they were dreaming and

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,880
they were able to consciously mimic that

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,080
same exact pattern showing that they

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,560
could actually have control over their

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,320
surroundings and their eye movement even

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,040
during their dreaming phase they did

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
other experiments too like clenching the

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,119
fist the same they told the lucid

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,159
dreamers to clench their fist as they

39
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,119
Lucid dreamed and the exact same

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,119
chemical sorry electrical signals which

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,640
happened when you clinch a fist happened

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,840
when they were dreaming so lucid

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,880
dreaming is a fact there's no question

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,000
about this in fact I believed in it

45
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,680
let's say because of Tim Ferris Tim

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,320
Ferris is the author of The 4-Hour Work

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,159
week and I mean you probably know Tim

48
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,759
Ferris right so Tim Ferris actually has

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,479
a story where he talks about wrestling

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,479
so he got good at wrestling by

51
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,159
practicing wrestling as he slept during

52
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,079
lucid dreaming and that skill actually

53
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,920
carried over into his practice the next

54
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,920
day so that immediately got me curious

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,799
It's like that's a super power if I can

56
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,079
practice stuff and get good while I'm

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
sleeping that gives me a genuine Edge

58
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,840
over the competition so that's why I

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,759
started doing it in the first place and

60
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,480
there's a certain reason I stopped doing

61
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,800
it and now I'm picking it up again

62
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,560
because I want to get good at these live

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,560
lectures and every bit of practice helps

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,760
so what are the benefits that you can

65
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,200
expect from lucid dreaming the first one

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,000
is of course the rehearsals like I

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
mentioned but it doesn't have to be just

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,239
rehearsals you can rehearse anything you

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,360
can rehearse specifically social

70
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,519
interactions

71
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,000
suppose you are a shy guy you know you

72
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,319
don't have confidence in public

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,440
understand suppose you kind of have some

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
kind of insecurities about your physique

75
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,319
your face whatever it is right you can

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
actually practice social interactions in

77
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,800
your lucid dreams suppose you have

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,519
trouble speaking to girls as every guy

79
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,720
does at some point in their life you can

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,560
practice and put in the Reps in the

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,239
comfort of your dreams you can play the

82
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,280
scenario out in any number of ways as

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
you sleep and yes absolutely this skill

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
does carry over and indeed this was one

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,120
of the first skills I was trying to

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,400
improve on while I mastered lucid

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
dreaming the most important component of

88
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,040
course is not any of these things it's

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
actually the Improvement of the

90
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,360
self-image I've told you this before in

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
a previous lecture the one on

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,959
brainwashing which was yesterday that

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
your success always lags behind your

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,680
self-image if by some chance your

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,959
success gets ahead of your self-image

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,720
for example if you win a lottery win a

97
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,799
dollar but your self image is still

98
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,239
behind you will actually be confronted

99
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,200
with immediate and successive failures

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,200
until that success comes back behind

101
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,120
your self-image so the real way to have

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,319
genuine lasting Improvement in life is

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,040
to improve the self-image and you can do

104
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,680
this using lucid dreaming I'll of course

105
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,640
pad it out and give you the full

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,319
autistic level steps soon I'm sure you

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,439
must be you know eager to learn this

108
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,000
lucid dreaming Elixir so let's get into

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,840
it I will warn you that this El will

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,560
actually work on the first night all

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,640
right this is a chemically induced lucid

112
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,079
dream but I don't recommend you do it on

113
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,120
the first night because you aren't

114
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,040
really looking for the lucid dream as

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,000
such you want the benefit of lucid

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
dreaming so I want you to follow the

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,519
protocol which I've laid out for you

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,799
there's nothing like this on the

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,959
internet if you want the benefits of

120
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,919
lucid dreaming please just do what I'm

121
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,759
saying just have trust and just adhere

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
to this all right lucid dreaming does

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,880
have some dangers which I will walk

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
through but if you do these then you

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,639
will get the best of it without any of

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,800
the risks so let's start talking about

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
the protocol hopefully you can see this

128
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,199
and the camera is not like too close to

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
me or anything hopefully by the grace of

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,160
God the camera is pointing in the right

131
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,680
direction today cuz yesterday it was

132
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,840
pointing the other direction I made you

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,080
guys watch grass grow literally for 30

134
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,479
minutes so let's talk about week one so

135
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,240
this is a two week program week one is

136
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,520
recall so in week one you are not

137
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,080
actually trying to induce lucid dream

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
dreaming all you're trying to do is

139
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,240
improve your dream recall all right so

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,840
dream recall is basically how well can

141
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,919
you remember your dreams if you're the

142
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,560
kind of guy who just has felt like you

143
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,880
never had a dream that you could

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,479
remember then this is most important for

145
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,360
you and I'm going to teach you the Casio

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,600
method I don't think there's anybody

147
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,600
online who's who understands this

148
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,360
concept well enough to have a method

149
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,479
like this so the Cassio method comes

150
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,680
from this my watch this Casio which of

151
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,919
course you don't have to have exact

152
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,280
watch and you don't even have to have a

153
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,840
Casio for that matter you can have any

154
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,400
kind of digital watch which has an

155
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
hourly chime function the hourly chime

156
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,479
function is basically I set it up such

157
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,120
that every single hour like 12:00 1:00

158
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,720
2:00 it will beep and I'll notice that

159
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,400
beep I'll look at my watch and let me

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,720
explain this very carefully all right so

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,039
the hourly chime function after it's

162
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
enabled makes you do something called

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
full day mindfulness so full day

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,280
mindfulness is kind

165
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,280
of a relaxed state of mind throughout

166
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,639
the day because every single hour you're

167
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,280
being reminded to be mindful when that

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,080
hourly chime Chimes you'll look at your

169
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,479
watch look at what time it is take a

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240
deep breath let it out be very aware of

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,680
the environment like literally every

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,199
detail like I'm looking at a beautiful

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,160
scenery of grass in front of me and I'm

174
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,000
looking at every single blade of grass

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,280
every leaf that's fallen down the

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,520
concrete under my

177
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,720
shoes the feeling of this you know

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,720
whiteboard against my hand the

179
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,080
environment the warmth against my skin

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,759
take another deep breath let it out and

181
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,319
become aware of the body itself so the

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,039
feeling of my the pressure I'm applying

183
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,440
on the surface the feeling of breath

184
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,919
going into my lungs bodily awareness so

185
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,319
there two components right environmental

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,639
awareness and body awareness and you're

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,520
doing this at the time of every hour and

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,879
I'll explain exactly why this is

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
happening the other continent is the

190
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,759
reality check so if you have ever looked

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,120
at lucid dreaming videos online before

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,199
you'll be aware of the idea of reality

193
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,520
checks and the most common reality check

194
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,000
is doing this like I have in my mind the

195
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,919
intention of pushing my finger through

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,080
my palm and obviously it doesn't happen

197
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,960
because I'm not

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
dreaming but in the dream I could

199
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,680
actually do this because in the dream

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
you kind of control the physics you can

201
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,919
do what you want so the reality check

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,520
which I'm going to give you is take your

203
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,680
watch right you're already concentrating

204
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,120
on the watch cuz you looked at it for

205
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,680
the hourly Chim you're going to try to

206
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,199
slide it off have it in your mind I can

207
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,199
slide off my watch obviously it doesn't

208
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,960
happen because I'm in reality right now

209
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm not dreaming so the watch doesn't

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
come off that's a reality check if the

211
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,960
watch does come off you know that you

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,039
are in a dream and then we have the

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,080
totem so the totem is your watch so

214
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,039
understand what I'm doing here I'm

215
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,360
creating a system where this watch has

216
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,360
become your tie to reality have you seen

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,919
the movie Inception they each like

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,840
character in Inception they have this

219
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,000
specialized item which they carry which

220
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,319
is their totem and they use this totem

221
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,680
to distinguish between what's a dream

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,599
and what's reality that's exactly the

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,360
concept I'm going for here by tying

224
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,080
together the mindfulness aspect of your

225
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,039
body and the environment to this

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,879
physical object this Casio watch and by

227
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,199
kind of practicing this reality check

228
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,240
for the first one week you have encoded

229
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,479
these thought patterns and this Behavior

230
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,319
pattern and it's tied to this physical

231
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,240
object this watch so when you are in a

232
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,639
dream which you aren't going to be

233
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,680
inducing a dream right now right you're

234
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,039
going to be inducing a dream only in

235
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,880
week two when you're starting to induce

236
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,000
lucid

237
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,599
dreams and you have these mental habits

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,479
and these physical habits this will be

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,800
your tie to reality and you'll know when

240
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,159
you're in a dream when you're not and

241
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,080
when you're loose to Dreaming you can

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,160
use that essentially as your tether to

243
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,399
what's real and what's not all right so

244
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,560
that's the totem your CIO watch and then

245
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
you're going to keep this watch either

246
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,760
on you you're going to actually wear it

247
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
when you're sleeping or you can actually

248
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,560
take it off and put it next to your

249
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,440
pillow if you want because that hourly

250
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,079
chime is still important so the hourly

251
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,040
chime has become your your queue for

252
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,839
mindfulness and this practice of trying

253
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,279
to take your watch off that queue stays

254
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,200
with you even in your REM sleep so when

255
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
you are sleeping you're deep in sleep

256
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
but your ears are still working when

257
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,160
your ears hear that chime it's going to

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
send to your brain hey remember we're

259
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,279
supposed to we're supposed to be mindful

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,200
right now we're supposed to take this

261
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,880
watch off right now and in your dream

262
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,320
you'll actually have that sensation

263
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,399
you'll have a sensation to be more

264
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,240
Vigilant of your dream and then you

265
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,320
start realizing that you are in a dream

266
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,240
because the dream doesn't really look

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,040
like reality it's it's just odd and

268
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,320
you'll have you kind of a feeling right

269
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,480
you start observing things and they

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
don't have the same kind of resolution

271
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,279
as they do in real life it might be hazy

272
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,920
might be blurry things aren't making

273
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,040
logical sense I mean it's a dream right

274
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,279
it's literally a dream and then you have

275
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,600
the sensation maybe I'm in in a dream

276
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,560
try to take off your watch and it comes

277
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,399
off there you go boom lucid dream that's

278
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,800
the concept of the Casio method and then

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
I also want you to Habit stack this

280
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,440
thing called journaling I mean you

281
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,720
obviously know what's journaling but

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
this is specifically dream journaling so

283
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,480
what you're going to be doing is you're

284
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
going to have a journal next to your bed

285
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
and whenever you have a dream for the

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
first one week you're not trying to

287
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,399
induce any Dreaming by the way it's just

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,640
like Preparatory phase every time you

289
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,200
have a dream during the first week

290
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
you're going to journal about it

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,600
specifically you're going to be focusing

292
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
on the environment write a couple

293
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,000
sentences two or three sentences about

294
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,680
the place where you find yourself in

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,120
your dream for me I have a lot of Dreams

296
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,839
in nature which is you know I like that

297
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
so I'll describe the nature around me

298
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,240
the Greenery and I think it's probably

299
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
because I spent a lot of time of my

300
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,560
childhood in nature like literally

301
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,680
climbing trees eating raspberries right

302
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,200
off the branches spending all my time

303
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,240
kind of alone but with nature I think

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,079
that's kind of seeped into my

305
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
subconscious and that's why I love this

306
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,200
setting so much so environment the

307
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,200
second thing you Journal about is

308
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,639
symbolism so often times in dreams the

309
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,360
objects that you see have a deeper

310
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,279
meaning to them and you may not be able

311
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,279
to interpret them but that's fine just

312
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,720
write down what symbols you see for me a

313
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,839
recurring theme has always been Bridges

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
the setting of the dream could be

315
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
different I could be in a city I could

316
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,079
be in nature I could be in a desert but

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
there's always some kind of bridge even

318
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,600
though the bridge looks different that

319
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,040
tells me that that's a that's a

320
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,279
symbolism there's something going on in

321
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,839
my subconscious about a bridge and

322
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,639
Bridge can be a symbol for tying two

323
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,600
different things together could be a

324
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,720
symbol for going from one place to

325
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,160
another you know transition Point don't

326
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,440
know why but that's a symbol which

327
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,040
manifests in my mind so I'll write my

328
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,519
best interpretation of that symbol of

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
course your symbols can be completely

330
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,720
different a lot of religious folk will

331
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,800
see religious icons which is really cool

332
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,560
but it's completely different some

333
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,160
people will see birds very often they'll

334
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,320
see lizards lizards is a common one some

335
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,720
people have bad symbols too some people

336
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
will dream of teeth falling out and that

337
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,320
could be a symbol tooth could be a

338
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,720
symbol so write your best interpretation

339
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,760
for what that might be and then you talk

340
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,079
about your emotions in your your Journal

341
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,240
you're talking about the mood of your

342
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,160
dream happy sad lustful highly possible

343
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,639
that it's

344
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
lustful jealous envious depends on what

345
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,240
your subconscious is giving you and I

346
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,240
don't want you to shy away from

347
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,839
everything that's why I wrote no secrets

348
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
your dreams could be dark places man

349
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,360
your dreams can be dark places at times

350
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,519
but if you are hiding it that's not

351
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,360
helping even if your dreams are of a

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,720
some kind of a criminal nature it's

353
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,920
better to write it out than to suppress

354
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,120
it CU that's also a part of your

355
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,639
yourself it's the shadow learning side

356
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,959
of it and you know you and in more

357
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,680
modern times Jordan Peterson talks about

358
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,880
this the Shadow Self so you can have a

359
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,240
better relationship with that self only

360
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,399
if you don't have any secrets this is

361
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,440
your personal Journal like no one's

362
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,240
going to read this so be honest with at

363
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,800
least yourself next we go to week two

364
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,920
which is the actual induction phase now

365
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,279
we are consciously wanting to induce

366
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,959
lucid dreaming so in week one you are

367
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,440
not actually consuming this uh Elixir

368
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,399
week two you are but not just yet the

369
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,440
first thing you want to do is Express

370
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,120
intent for lucid dreaming so you are

371
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,480
going to before you sleep your last

372
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
three sentences that you tell to your

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,920
mind will be something like today I will

374
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,160
control my dreams today I will control

375
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,199
my dreams today I will control my dreams

376
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,680
and then you try to fall asleep right

377
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,440
that tells your mind what to do it's an

378
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,839
auto suggestion you're telling your mind

379
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,120
hey this is what's expected go according

380
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
to the

381
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,560
plan next is the mental rehearsal of a

382
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,600
dream so try to have a memory of a dream

383
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,480
that you had in the past I have this

384
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,320
very specific dream of me I was a child

385
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,600
in this dream because because like all

386
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,680
the bushes and everything were pretty

387
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,480
high so I knew that I was like you know

388
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,079
four or something like that and in this

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,199
dream there's a bridge like many dreams

390
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,800
and it's not even a real Bridge it's

391
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,279
like a Chasm between two grassy Hills or

392
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,120
or Cliffs there's a tree which is fallen

393
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
over forming a bridge and it's a

394
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,519
slippery tree it's like moss growing on

395
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,880
it and and there's a girl on the other

396
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,440
side and this is not any kind of sexual

397
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,240
dream right this girl is just a child

398
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
like myself so this child girl is on the

399
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,920
other side and I need to talk to her I

400
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,000
need to meet her I don't know why it's

401
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,600
important but it is and I start walking

402
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
on this bridge but every time I reach

403
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,399
the other side I wake up so I don't know

404
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,320
what the conclusion of that dream is but

405
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,839
I remember that dream pretty vividly so

406
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,839
I'll induce Dreaming by imagining that

407
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,720
dream and then eventually you fall

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,000
asleep and for whatever reason that

409
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,839
doing that increases the chance of lucid

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,680
dreaming induction

411
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,440
then let's talk about the aler all right

412
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
this is the chemical induction for lucid

413
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,800
dreaming and I have to have a medical

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,800
disclaimer I don't recommend lucid

415
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,920
dreaming I don't recommend any of

416
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,120
these substances which I'm going to talk

417
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,199
about this is not medical advice you

418
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,120
proceed at your own risk so this is not

419
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,639
something you may be familiar with this

420
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,680
is a bottle of methylene blue it's a

421
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,040
very special and interesting substance

422
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,320
this is actually a mitochondrial support

423
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,160
solution

424
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,480
and what this does is it has many

425
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,199
properties some of them are anti-aging

426
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,880
properties but that's not what we need

427
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,839
for this purpose and in fact Metaline

428
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,040
blue is not considered to be a sleep

429
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,639
supplement at all in fact it's a energy

430
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,959
inducing supplement makes you more

431
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,320
energetic it makes you more cogniz and

432
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,320
makes your brain power crank up it's an

433
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,120
overclocking type supplement but it also

434
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
has the function of increasing memory

435
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,399
memory recall by boosting up the

436
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,120
mitochondria in your brain so that's why

437
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,800
methylene blue is a core component of

438
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,880
this but meth blue is kind of like a

439
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,279
time bomb so mealine blue has 30 minutes

440
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,160
to 1 hour before it kicks in so you

441
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,720
don't want to have this 1 hour prior to

442
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,759
bed you want to have it immediately when

443
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,639
you're lying down to sleep cuz then you

444
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,680
fall asleep and then it activates which

445
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,720
is ideal you want it to activate once

446
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,920
you're already asleep not before cuz if

447
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,680
it's before then you're going to lose

448
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,639
sleep you're not going to be able to

449
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
sleep if Metaline blue is activated so

450
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,759
mein

451
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,279
blue then glycine glycine is a neuro

452
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:04,279
transmitter which it boosts the widness

453
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,079
of your dream it makes your dream come

454
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,600
to life it's more colorful it's just

455
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,199
more easy to remember it's

456
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,199
it's kind of cranks up the dream to 11

457
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,000
all right so glycine is for the

458
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,880
neurotransmitter benefit and then you

459
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,560
have something called zma zma is a

460
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,000
supplement it's zinc magnesium aspartate

461
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,759
so it's a zinc and magnesium supplement

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,720
basically it also contains vitamin B6 so

463
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,519
you can either buy zma or you can just

464
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,480
buy zinc supplement separately magnesium

465
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,600
supp supplement separately and B6

466
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
separately that's completely up to you

467
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,880
how you want to do it it's the core

468
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,399
components are the same if you are

469
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,000
struggling to sleep then perhaps leave

470
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,399
the zinc out because zinc is a little

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,680
bit of an axiory so just stick with the

472
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,319
Magnesium the B6 also if you have a

473
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,639
powerful um animal based diet you don't

474
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,600
really need B6 cuz you're getting plenty

475
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,480
of B6 through your animal based diet so

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,240
the main component is really magnesium

477
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,040
and if you if you want to cross out zma

478
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
by the the way let me tick these things

479
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,600
off I I wanted to tick these things off

480
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,319
as the video progress I thought that' be

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,280
cool progression but I forgot so here we

482
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,880
are talked about methylene blue talk

483
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,280
about glycine so zinc magnesium and if

484
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,799
you want to just do magnesium you can do

485
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,799
magnesium glycinate and just leave out

486
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:19,360
the zinc and leave out the B6 if that's

487
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,160
what you want to do all right so this B6

488
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,679
is an optional because if you're already

489
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,480
getting zma then you don't need an

490
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,439
additional source of B6 so that's why I

491
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,440
put a question mark you have two other

492
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,240
items Co and Valerian root these are

493
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,160
optional if you want you can try them I

494
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,320
have not needed them but I do think that

495
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,559
they help so Valyrian route is going to

496
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,480
relax you and Coline is going to again

497
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,799
boost recall of your dreams so it's

498
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,960
experimental I'm going to put a question

499
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,039
mark on these depends on your personal

500
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,760
biochemistry there's other things too

501
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,280
but these are the basics try these if

502
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,280
they don't work then put in the comments

503
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,919
and maybe I'll add other components to

504
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,679
The Elixir all right very powerful like

505
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,480
think about what's going on here the in

506
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,360
blue is boosting cognition and memory

507
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,520
recall and glycine is making your dreams

508
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,919
more lucid and more Vivid the zma on

509
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,159
itself is a powerful inducer of sleep

510
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,919
because of the Magnesium specifically B6

511
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:18,159
improves recall choline improves recall

512
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,000
Valerian gives you a more relaxed state

513
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,840
so together this is you know a one shot

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,360
success to get to lucid dreaming so we

515
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,240
talked about intent we talked about

516
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,679
mental rehearsals we talked about the

517
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,840
now we talk about programmable lights so

518
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,240
this is another tactic which I've never

519
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,240
seen anybody cover on YouTube because

520
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
most YouTubers don't know what the hell

521
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,159
they're talking about right there

522
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,080
actually a whole Channel called explore

523
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,919
lucid dreaming and he has the most basic

524
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,240
freaking advice you don't get basic

525
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,000
advice here boys you get the actual good

526
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,080
stuff so programmable lights there's an

527
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
I give you an example Philips Hue is a

528
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,799
kind of a programmable light which is

529
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,559
what I own you can kind of set up when

530
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,280
the light turns on you have a program

531
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,600
like you have a app on your phone which

532
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,520
you can use to set up when the lights

533
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,080
turn on so take your time of waking for

534
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,640
me it's usually 8:00 a.m. subtract 2 so

535
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,480
6 a.m. so minus 2 you get that time and

536
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,679
you use the holy it's getting windy

537
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,919
out here hopefully you can still here

538
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,159
because I have this um lav mic so the

539
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,520
programmable lights turned on 2 hours

540
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,960
prior to waking and what you're doing is

541
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,720
you're setting it on for 15 minutes and

542
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,600
then off for 15 minutes on 15 minutes

543
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,880
and then off for 15 minutes and you're

544
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,159
not getting it too bright you're just

545
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,799
getting it bright enough that it induces

546
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,360
some kind of wakefulness in you what I

547
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,080
mean by that is doesn't straight up wake

548
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,919
you up because it's so bright but it

549
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,480
just tells your brain hey be alert and

550
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,320
doing that induces lucid dreaming so

551
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,600
follow this protocol and use this Elixir

552
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,799
and it's like 80 to 90% guarantee that

553
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,120
you're going to get lucid dreaming

554
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,159
finally the question is once you

555
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,120
reliably induce lucid dreaming what do

556
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,720
you do with that new found power what

557
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,039
you do is first you find yourself a

558
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,840
mentor so you can actually find high

559
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,000
quality me not even find make your own

560
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,159
Mentor cuz you're are lucid dreaming

561
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,640
right so what you do is choose whichever

562
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,039
influencer or even historical figure

563
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,200
that you want to emulate or get advice

564
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,080
from and you can actually bring them

565
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,159
into your lucid dream so I did this and

566
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,200
it's kind of cringe now but I did this

567
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,480
with Jordan Peters

568
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,039
and this was before he joined daily wire

569
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,360
this is before his mental breakdown

570
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,960
which I don't know something bad

571
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,120
happened to him during that one year and

572
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,799
when he came out he was just not the

573
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,320
same I didn't like him anymore I didn't

574
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,280
have the same respect but during the

575
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,640
first you know 6 months of his rise I

576
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,440
really liked him I really liked his

577
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,200
message I really liked his Charisma I

578
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,919
lik the fact that he knew so much about

579
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,760
the world which I didn't so I watched a

580
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,840
lot of his content with the intention of

581
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm going to create this Jordan Peterson

582
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,039
in my mind and I can use him for advice

583
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,919
and M mentorship in my dream you can do

584
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:04,120
this for anybody right if if hamza's

585
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,200
message really resonates with you and

586
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,400
list Hamza as your personal Mentor just

587
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,200
watch a lot of his content absorb his

588
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,039
way of speaking the kind of advice that

589
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,039
he gives and then have the intention of

590
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:17,480
bringing him to life in your dream next

591
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,679
item is future sight this is something

592
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,559
that you should definitely do even if

593
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,600
you don't do mentorship because

594
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,799
mentorship like creating a a file of a

595
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,840
person in your dream is a challenge but

596
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,200
future site is something you should

597
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,880
absolutely do I talked about this

598
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,159
yesterday's lecture

599
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,640
future sight is the art and craft of

600
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,840
bringing to life your future self before

601
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,360
he has even Arisen so I bring to life my

602
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,320
30-year-old version of myself and I

603
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,799
imagine that's this man he's stronger

604
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,679
than me he has calluses on his arm his

605
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,600
neck is thicker his voice is deeper his

606
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,279
Charisma his presence is more powerful

607
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,080
he's a better Storyteller he's a nine

608
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:56,080
out of 10 Storyteller he has an

609
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,200
abundance mindset with money I'm not

610
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,120
there yet right I'm not 30 yet but I can

611
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,279
Envision that 30-year-old version of

612
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,000
myself in the lucid dream and get

613
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,799
mentorship From My Future Self and

614
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,200
thereby become him before I have to

615
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,720
become him thereby basically I'm using a

616
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,799
shortcut imagine if you're you know 16

617
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,360
17 you visualize the 25y old version of

618
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,480
yourself now you have the maturity and

619
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,400
understanding and attitude of an older

620
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,480
version of you and you're still

621
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,600
competing with fellow 16-year-olds how

622
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,520
powerful is that that's the power of

623
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,039
Luci dream man you bend reality to your

624
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,559
will and use that to bend the actual

625
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,880
reality to your will next okay I don't

626
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,440
know if I want to talk about this one

627
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,440
you can PR you can practice sex all

628
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,279
right you can practice sex in your lucid

629
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,520
dreams don't get too carried away but

630
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,520
you can and it does carry over to real

631
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,840
life it makes you more mindful makes you

632
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
more present makes you enjoy the

633
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,480
experience

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,960
more I don't know how much I want to

635
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,640
share about

636
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,320
this

637
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,799
all right I'll tell you some guidelines

638
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
all right don't get carried away don't

639
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,279
do it every single day I don't know what

640
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,760
effect it has on the dopamine circuits

641
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,120
like you know watching porn does it's

642
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,880
not the same though um I've experimented

643
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
with it I don't understand the

644
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,919
neurochemistry I'll be completely honest

645
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I don't think anybody has studied this

646
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,159
no scientist even the foremost experts

647
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,240
doesn't know what's going on over here

648
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,520
but it's real it's different from

649
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,640
visualizing porn on the Internet cuz

650
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
you're making a reality it has a

651
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,640
different effect on the dopamine

652
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,360
circuitry it's not a ative effect but

653
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,919
like anything I want to caution you that

654
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,279
you know too much of a good thing is a

655
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,799
bad thing right so I want to give you

656
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,360
that

657
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,320
disclaimer next we have triumphs so you

658
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,600
have core memories everybody has won at

659
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,159
something in the past everybody has some

660
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,360
kind of victory in their life I want you

661
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,080
to relive those core Victory memories to

662
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,120
shape the person that you are right now

663
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,000
so future sight was looking forward

664
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,640
Imagining the Victorious triumphant

665
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
future you and bringing him here core

666
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,080
memories is when you look at the past

667
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,320
and relive memories which you have

668
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,400
already have been seeing success in so

669
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,480
one of mine is I remember this very very

670
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,600
vividly and I'm I'm young like super

671
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,559
young I think like fifth grade or maybe

672
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,919
fourth grade even I run out of my school

673
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,600
bus and I have this silver metal with a

674
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,360
green ribbon around it I'm running to to

675
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,240
my mom because I was so proud I had won

676
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,559
this Science Olympia at something like

677
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,080
super nerdy stuff but I'll never forget

678
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,799
it because was a m of Triumph for me and

679
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,760
I use that to remind myself that I have

680
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,919
the mental ability to solve any kind of

681
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,559
problem I am I believe myself to be

682
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,760
gifted enough to crack any kind of

683
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,840
problem using my intellect is it true or

684
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,399
not doesn't matter I manifest a reality

685
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,520
that's helpful for me in my life and

686
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,120
then finally we have the rehearsals so

687
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,720
this is what Tim Ferris was talking

688
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,880
about you know rehearsing uh wrestling

689
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,480
before he had to do any kind of

690
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,799
competition you can use this for

691
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,760
anything you can use this for any kind

692
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
of musical instrument you can use this

693
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,720
for talking to girls you can use this

694
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,000
for public speaking like what I do so

695
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
the reason I started doing lucid

696
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,960
dreaming again is specifically for these

697
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,399
calls these are live streams so I don't

698
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,640
really have any kind of crutch I don't

699
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:22,200
have notes that I can read and deliver I

700
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,120
can't edit this too much in post I don't

701
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,520
have ai generated images to drive

702
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,600
engagement it's just kind of me chilling

703
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,399
with you in real time having a

704
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,919
conversation trying to impart some kind

705
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,399
of knowledge that I have but even so

706
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
this is a YouTube video and this is of

707
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,039
course a business I need these videos to

708
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,399
perform yeah that's just the truth of it

709
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,760
right any YouTuber who says otherwise is

710
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,760
lying so the question is like how do I

711
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,960
make a compelling video but do it

712
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,440
without notes do it without editing I

713
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,000
practice this in my sleep before I come

714
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,320
on stage this is essentially a kind of

715
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,640
stage well a personal stage cuz I'm

716
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,720
trying to talk to one of you and that's

717
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,679
that's a part of the lucid dreaming self

718
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,120
hypnosis I'm trying to talk as

719
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,320
personably but in a prepared way to one

720
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,200
person now it's a question whether that

721
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,159
comes off like that on camera or not but

722
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,840
that's the thing you can practice any

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,919
kind of scenario that you want you can

724
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,960
modify this oh and I should also say

725
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,840
Metaline blue is not FDA regulated all

726
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,720
right so the quality control is all all

727
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,640
over the

728
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,760
place so you can only get it from some

729
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,720
places which have the highest C C

730
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,840
ification rating it's called a

731
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,880
certificate of analysis uh yeah

732
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,679
certificate COA right it's a it's called

733
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,000
a pharmaceutical certificate of analysis

734
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,320
and there's also something called the

735
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,039
USP rating so you need to look for these

736
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,919
two components in order to make your

737
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,559
purchase cuz a lot of brands are selling

738
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,960
bad quality methine blue which have

739
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,919
heavy metals which are probably doing

740
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,559
more harm than good so you want the good

741
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,000
quality stuff the one which I use is

742
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,720
called maroi medicinal all right I don't

743
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,480
know how well you can see it but Mari

744
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,799
medicinal you can see I've gone through

745
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,440
quite a bit of it this is the brand that

746
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,360
I recommend I actually reached out to

747
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,240
them so that I can read their COA which

748
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,600
is the certificate of analysis and

749
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,600
actually make sure that they are you

750
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,679
know being truthful to their claims so I

751
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,799
talk to them I even got a discount code

752
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,279
for 15% off I think so if you use a

753
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,640
discount code you're going to get 15%

754
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,120
off it's up to you if you want to use it

755
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,039
or not so that's my disclaimer about

756
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,320
methine blue do not get the Amazon

757
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,840
Brands there's a lot of brands on Amazon

758
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,080
which are just selling methine blue they

759
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,600
claim to be USP verified I don't know if

760
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,200
that's true I know that this brand is

761
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,440
actually verified so just choose this I

762
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,000
hope it's available across the world I

763
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,279
don't know but if you're in the US for

764
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,760
sure you can get it and I have a

765
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,039
challenge for you so as you know these

766
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,480
lectures are not free I have a fee for

767
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,159
these one of them is the homework so the

768
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,840
homework for today is write down in the

769
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,320
comment section below or in if you're in

770
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,120
calls Country Club my private Community

771
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,880
for health and education you should do

772
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,559
this in the col Country Club instead go

773
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,600
to the challenges category and write

774
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,840
this down you're going to write why you

775
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,320
want to do lucid dreaming because when

776
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,720
you connect a why to what you're going

777
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,360
to do that's when you see success and I

778
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
want you to you got a bunch of knowledge

779
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,080
right I taught you a bunch of things

780
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
immediately connected to your why and

781
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,320
then write it down in the comments or in

782
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,519
colge Country Club I will assess and I

783
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,279
will give feedback as

784
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,519
required finally I'll say that

785
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,559
tomorrow's lecture is actually going to

786
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,240
be a whole lecture on methylene blue

787
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,440
because I believe it's that important

788
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,519
this chemical has many applications I

789
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,519
think you should be educated on its on

790
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,480
its uh importance yesterday's lecture

791
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,960
was about brainwashing yourself for

792
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,240
success I think that goes really well

793
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,399
with this lecture so you haven't watched

794
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,640
that you absolutely should I teach three

795
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,919
other techniques other than lucid

796
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,480
dreaming to brainwash yourself and then

797
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,279
the supplements I mentioned I've

798
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,200
mentioned uh glycine zma B6 Etc I have

799
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,039
the Amazon page for those exact

800
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,760
supplements including the lights and the

801
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,960
watch actually so you can check out the

802
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,640
supplements and everything in the Amazon

803
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,120
link and of course I should mention the

804
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
risk of lucid dreaming there's the

805
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,399
reason I stopped doing lucid dreaming

806
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
which is lucid dreaming actually takes

807
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:11,600
away from the restfulness of sleep

808
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,519
because you're using your sleep also as

809
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,080
a training device so when you do that

810
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,919
you aren't getting the full restorative

811
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,720
benefits of sleep on top of that there's

812
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,240
another thing you're not that wise you

813
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,159
know you don't have that much wisdom and

814
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,840
nor do I so when you're taking control

815
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,039
of your subconscious like this you're

816
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,519
basically say to your subconscious hey

817
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,600
this is what we're going to focus on

818
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,600
let's focus on this but the thing is in

819
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,799
life you often don't know what the right

820
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,919
thing to focus on is so your

821
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,519
subconscious has its own wisdom and

822
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,760
sometimes it's better to let go of the

823
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,080
wheel and let the subconscious rehearse

824
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,679
whatever it wants to rehearse so I was

825
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,880
doing lucid dreaming for quite a while

826
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:52,279
almost a year more than a year probably

827
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,440
and I let it go because I wasn't getting

828
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,200
the restful sleep that I wanted and also

829
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,240
I wanted to leave the rains and let the

830
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,960
subconscious take over for for some time

831
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,840
now that I have a definite intent of

832
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,279
getting good at these video calls I want

833
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,080
to bring back lucid dreaming and take

834
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,320
command of my subconscious so it depends

835
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,159
on you where you are in life I recommend

836
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,000
getting a Mastery of the skill and then

837
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,320
when you don't need it just don't do it

838
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,919
so you can actually induce this right I

839
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,600
told you how to induce this chemically

840
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,760
so just don't take the Metaline blue at

841
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,960
night and you won't lose a dream also I

842
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,559
should speak about the timing of these

843
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,880
um of The Elixir so the glycine zma B6

844
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,080
choline valerian root you can have it an

845
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,600
hour before bed because if you drink a

846
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,519
lot of liquids just before you sleep

847
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,679
it's likely that you want to piss and

848
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,279
then you're going to disrupt your sleep

849
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,799
cycle right so you can have all these an

850
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,240
hour before bed so that you have an

851
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,799
opportunity to urinate and then you

852
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,840
aren't interrupted when you are actually

853
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,880
dreaming but the methylene blue is

854
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,200
different the methylene blue you have it

855
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,200
just before sleeping like you have it

856
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,720
then go to your bed so how much of it do

857
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,240
you have uh you have 5 Mig which is one

858
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,639
let me actually show you this stuff it's

859
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,720
it's actually just one dropper of

860
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,000
mealine blue just before you sleep so

861
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,080
that's the recommendations on

862
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
dosage finally I'll say that if you like

863
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,720
me and I'm not talking about my content

864
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,159
if you like me personally then you

865
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
should follow me on Instagram cuz I

866

knowledge as I go about my day and I

868
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,399
think it will greatly benefit you and

869
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,000
also if you just want to know me

870
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:24,760

pondering and I haven't made that offer

880
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,159
