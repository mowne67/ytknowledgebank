1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
Most people don't know this, but the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,200
esoteric health movement was born out of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,679
the pandemic. We all know that Fizer,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
the vaccine companies, walked away with

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
billions of dollars. They acted above

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,080
the law. You couldn't sue them for

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
vaccine injury. I'm going to share with

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
you a story that I saw in real life.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
When I was getting my surgery done for

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
fixing the structures of my nose, I was

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
seated beside another patient who was

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
talking to the doctor and there was only

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
a curtain separating us so I could hear

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
the conversation. The doctor asked her

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
about her frozen shoulder. Now, at the

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,120
time, I didn't know what frozen shoulder

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
was. It's essentially a muscularkeeletal

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,440
injury that prevents free movement of

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
the shoulder joint. The doctor asked her

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,200
an interesting question. He asked her

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,000
which side did she get her COVID shot

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
on? And she said it was the side where

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
she has the frozen shoulder. What he

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
remarked was first that he has he's been

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,480
seeing more frozen shoulder injuries

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
than ever before which that that in

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,600
itself is suspicious but he also said

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,400
that the shoulder injury this the frozen

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,600
shoulder always happens on the side in

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
which the patient got the COVID 19 shot.

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
Here's another place where I lost trust

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
in the health institutions. Back when

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
the pandemic was still raging, there was

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
this observation made that the black

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
community had higher rates of

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
complication from this disease. Further

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,880
investigation led to the finding that it

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
was because the black community had

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,400
higher rates of obesity and that obesity

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,880
was driving complications with COVID 19.

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,799
But that's not what was pushed out. What

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
they pushed out was it's because of

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
systemic racism. They could have used

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,960
the opportunity to chart a path towards

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
a healthier society. They did not do

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
this. Instead, they drove us apart and

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,200
made it about race rather than actually

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,040
helping people. All they had to do to

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
reduce the complication rates and even

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
the mortality rates of COVID 19 was to

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
attack obesity. If Americans could just

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
become less obese, many more people

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
would have survived the pandemic. But

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
that's not what they focused on.

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Instead, they focused on pharmaceutical

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
intervention. They focused on a vaccine

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
that enriched them and made the pharma

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,799
companies billions. And so the people

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
felt betrayed. We looked up to the

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
government for guidance, but instead

61
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
received nothing. And so we looked to

62
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,640
each other and a grassroots movement was

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,560
born which was the esoteric health

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
movement. As a recent graduate of one of

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
the best biosciences program in the US

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,239
and possibly the world. I was torn

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
between trusting the scientific

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
institutions and the scientific method.

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,879
For me science was always about asking

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
questions and not about blind faith in

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
authority. So I try to find answers for

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
myself about my health because in the

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
end of the day the only person

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
responsible for my health is myself. not

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
the government, not doctors, not the

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
CDC's, and certainly not health

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,519
insurance or the pharma companies. Soon

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I found others like myself who had

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
turned away from the consensus and

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
instead to each other. It was around

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
this time that I started making my first

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
YouTube videos to spread the message of

83
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,239
esoteric health and to reveal some of

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
the lies that we have been fed. I was

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
one of the first to talk about estrogens

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,680
in the water supply and that you should

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,280
be using a shower filter. I was one of

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
the first to talk about tallow to be

89
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
used as a skinincare product. I was one

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
of the first to start talking about

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
fluoride in the water and why you should

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,760
use a reverse osmosis filter or a carbon

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
filter to protect yourself. I was also

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,000
speaking of using saturated fats in your

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
diet like butter and eggs despite what

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
the doctors might say. What are the core

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,760
tenants of the esoteric health movement?

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
The first is that don't trust

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
authorities blindly. The second is

100
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,800
embrace traditions and time-tested

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
methods towards help. And the third is

102
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,400
to embrace self-experimentation and

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
trying to figure things out for

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
yourself. And this brings us to the

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,519
current timeline, the decade of

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,840
divergence. My objective with this

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
channel was always to make the esoteric

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,959
more accessible. And I want to announce

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,560
to you quite happily that we have won.

110
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
On the political front, it looks like

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Red 40 might be on track to getting

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,360
banned. Very cool. Second, if you didn't

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,760
know this, baby formula is actually

114
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,159
required by law to have seed oils in

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,080
them and that's under investigation and

116
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,680
might also get banned. And thirdly,

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
there's an investigation going into

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
fluoride in the water and that too might

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
be removed. Now, here's an important

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,920
point I'd like to make. If you're

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
worried that health is becoming

122
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,959
political, guess what? Health was always

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
political. It's not a bad thing. This is

124
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
the way change happens from a cultural

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
standpoint. What are we seeing? I

126
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,479
actually saw this in real life when I

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
was in the locker room in my university

128
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
gym a couple months ago. I overheard a

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
conversation between a couple young guys

130
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
and they were talking about where to get

131
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,000
food. It was late in the day. They said

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
that they were going to go to B-Dubz

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
Buffalo Wild Wings for those who don't

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,680
know. They said that they would go there

135
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
because they didn't use seed oils. Now,

136
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
I don't know if this is true, but the

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,120
fact that they are even speaking of seed

138
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
oils is a conversation that would not

139
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
happen could not happen 2 years ago. And

140
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
we see that some companies, some fast

141
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
food companies like Steak and Shake are

142
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
moving from using seed oils to tallow.

143
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
Now, what does this mean? It's possible

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,919
that other chains will start to follow.

145
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,320
McDonald's used to use tallow for their

146
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,080
fries. They stopped because of a scop.

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,320
They stopped because Proctor and Gamble

148
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
funded the AHA, the American Heart

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
Association, to convince the boomers

150
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
that seed oil was healthy and the tallow

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,600
was not. And this caused a change in

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,680
public perception, which is why

153
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
McDonald's decided to switch from tallow

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
to seed oils. So if the public

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
perception shifts again, there's no

156
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
reason why McDonald's wouldn't shift

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
from seed oils back to Tallow. So in the

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
end of the day, these companies, they

159
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
will just follow the trend. So it is up

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
to us to make sure that the culture is

161
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,919
correct. Other crazy observations in

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,840
Walmart, you can find fluoride free

163
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,039
toothpaste back in the day. Like back

164
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
when I say back in the day, I mean like

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,199
two years ago. Two years ago, you could

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,080
only find fluoride free toothpaste in

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
Whole Foods or like high-end chains or

168
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,160
you'd have to search for it online. But

169
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,240
nowadays, Walmart carries it. And not

170
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
just that, you can find reliably, you

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
can reliably find products, skincare

172
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
products which are not toxic like Dr.

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,479
Squatch. You can find Dr. Squatch at

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Walmart. Again, pretty good product. No

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,479
toxins. How long before Walmart start

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
carrying tallow bomb? How long before

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,680
Walmart carries methylene blue? End of

178
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
the day, this is a huge victory for us

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,520
and we should be proud of how far our

180
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
movement has come. But here's the thing.

181
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
Whenever a movement starts to gain

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
traction, there are always bad actors

183
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
who will try to use this for their own

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
selfish ends. Let's look at an easy

185
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,800
example. Liver King back in the day, he

186
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
was one of the first to talk about raw

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
meat, talking about raw eggs, raw milk.

188
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,479
He was speaking of spending time in the

189
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,800
sun. He was speaking about an ancestral

190
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,280
diet. All very good things, all messages

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
which I can get behind. However, this

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
was essentially a marketing stunt. He

193
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
didn't really believe in any of these

194
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,240
things because at the end of the day, he

195
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,400
was promoting this message and using his

196
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
physique as proof, but he was using

197
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,039
steroids to get his physique and he was

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,960
lying about it. And once he was exposed,

199
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
what did he do? He didn't have any

200
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,479
shame. He just kept on doing the same

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
thing, promoting the same message. Well,

202
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,919
obviously his results did not come from

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
those methods. It came from the

204
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,600
anabolics. So, to be clear, I'm not

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
against using anabolics. You do whatever

206
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,240
you want. I'm against lying. I'm against

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
lying about the source of your results.

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,919
Now, here's the thing. I focus on Liver

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
King because it's such a stark example

210
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,759
of doing wrong. But here's the truth,

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,599
right? Many many influencers, many who

212
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,919
you probably follow and trust are also

213
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,599
using steroids, also doing it covertly,

214
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,800
and you just don't know. You just buy

215
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,319
their supplements because you think that

216
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
you'll get the results which they have,

217
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,199
but actually their results come from the

218
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
anabolics. Let's talk about supplements

219
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,680
in general. 90% of supplements are

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
garbage. They are a waste of your money.

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,759
Just save your money. is focus on the

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,759
basics. There is an esoteric arms race

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
going on. Every influencer wants to be

224
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
the first to talk about the next

225
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,080
supplement. We have influencers who are

226
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,759
talking about using deer antler velvet

227
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,520
to boost their testosterone. They're

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,240
talking about colostrum to increase

229
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,479
their IGF-1 to hopefully get taller.

230
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
They're speaking of using pine pollen in

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
order to again increase their

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
testosterone. All this stuff is

233
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
[ __ ] Highly expensive supplements

234
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
for almost negligible gains and possibly

235
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,919
side effects which are not well studied.

236
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
The reason people buy supplements is

237
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,639
nothing to do with the science behind

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,680
them. The science behind them is usually

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
very shoddy. It's all to do with the

240
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,199
copyrightiting. Each supplement company

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,120
has dedicated copywriters whose entire

242
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,960
job is to write these words, these

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
scripts which convince you that this is

244
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,919
the next thing that you need. And if you

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,759
just had the supplement, you would have

246
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,759
the dream outcome. And even with

247
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
messaging, different creators within the

248
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
health space are on the quest to find

249
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,479
the next controversial take, the next

250
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,039
hot take about health in order to

251
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,479
convince you that by following them, you

252
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
are at the cutting edge of health. And

253
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,120
by following them, you are given this

254
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,039
advantage over others. The truth is, if

255
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
you focus on the fundamentals, you're

256
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,919
probably going to be ahead of everybody

257
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,399
anyway. The fundamentals haven't

258
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,240
changed. The human being as a biological

259
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,080
entity hasn't changed in the past 5,000

260
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,920
years, probably much more than that. And

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
the fundamentals again are sleep,

262
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,240
exercise, and diet. If you are not

263
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
optimized in these three, then what's

264
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
the point of supplements? And the second

265
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
phenomenon coming out of health is the

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
cultlike personalities. Things like

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Brian Johnson trying to start an actual

268
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,800
cult. So don't die is a religion. Don't

269
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,800
die is an economic system. Don't die is

270
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
is a political system. Don't die as an

271
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
ethical, moral, and social system that

272
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,800
we have. Let's say we have something

273
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,200
like a trillion dollars under management

274
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,240
where people take their savings and they

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
put it into a don't die managed fund

276
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
where we can move money in markets to

277
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,040
actually move towards things that uh

278
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
push towards don't die. But basically

279
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,320
trying to build a nation state and a

280
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,480
religion and a social uh movement in

281
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,760
like a two-year time period. I get why

282
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,560
people have said um you're obsessed with

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Joseph Smith and and you want to be your

284
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
own Joseph Smith. So that I didn't

285
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
understand before and I I actually it's

286
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
not Joseph Smith. My competitor is

287
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
Jesus. The first tenant of the esoteric

288
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,279
health movement is don't blindly trust

289
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,440
authorities. It means don't trust the

290
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
CDC. Don't trust the pharma companies.

291
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Don't trust the government. But it also

292
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,320
means don't trust influencers. Includes

293
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,320
individuals among us. People in among

294
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,240
us. The [ __ ] Got distracted. And this

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
includes myself. Everything I say you

296
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,480
should verify and can test on your own.

297
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,399
So here's the big question. Who do you

298
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
trust? Who's left that you can actually

299
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,079
trust? The answer is you need to

300
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
actually have a filter. You need to

301
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,440
learn philosophy. This is why philosophy

302
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
is important. You need to be able to

303
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,279
detect double speak. Double speak is a

304
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
term invented by George Orwell. And what

305
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,560
it means is you're using language not to

306
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
communicate but rather to obfiscate. The

307
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,839
topic of double speak is something which

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to explore in depth. This is not

309
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
the time or place. But there's one point

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
which I want you to carry with you. You

311
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
are not dumb. You are not stupid. If

312
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,920
somebody who's in a position of

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,600
authority is saying things in such a way

314
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
that you're thinking, I don't fully

315
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,839
understand it, but I trust it. It means

316
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
they're using double speak. You should

317
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,279
be able to understand the arguments

318
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
being made. You should be able to

319
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,200
understand the words and ideas being

320
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,600
presented clearly. If somebody is not

321
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
taking the effort to make their ideas

322
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,120
succinct, understandable, and

323
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,959
digestible, either they're being lazy

324
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
and you should not respect them, or they

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,320
are actively trying to deceive you, in

326
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
which case you should not trust them.

327
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
And just as a side note, if somebody

328
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,800
says that they're competing with Jesus,

329
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm not inclined to trust
