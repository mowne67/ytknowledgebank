1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,800
would you agree with me if I said that

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,319
the biggest names of the masculinity and

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,920
self-improvement space just feel hollow

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,360
you have first man Tate Jordan Peterson

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,040
and Hamza all of these you know

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
unshakable pillars of wisdom all of them

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,840
just feel hollow and the entire space

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,960
just feels Barren I did this poll and

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,320
90% agreed with me that they felt a Vibe

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,519
shift they felt that something had

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,439
changed and the comments just reinforced

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,640
my belief that we are in fact a period

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
of transition ition even Hamza is losing

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,640
support not just in numbers but also in

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,960
public perception are we at the end of

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,440
the Hamza era you likely know this but

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,160
actually worked very closely with Hamza

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,360
for months during his meteoric rise from

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,960
500k to 1 million subscribers so I

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,239
personally know him I worked as a

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
thinker and strategizer he's far more

22
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,359
intelligent than his empathetic

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,359
personality conveys I'm going to

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,160
continue to do that exact same job in

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,120
this video by analyzing the entire

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,680
masculinity and self-improvement space

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
and tell you exact L what's going to

28
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,960
happen in the next 8 months to

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
understand hamza's rise and fall we need

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,920
to look at the broader context and we

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,360
need to look at the timeline of his

32
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,200
Ascent I'm going to take you back all

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,960
the way to 2014 when the story of the

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,240
masculinity movement on YouTube first

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,400
started so most people don't actually

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,600
know this but the current masculinity

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,680
era comes from the dark days of the Pua

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,159
the pickup artist era the older guys

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,720
might know what I'm talking about right

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
so I started watching YouTube around

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,079
2014 and this was during the dying gasps

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
of the Pua movement the Pua movement was

43
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,759
basically a collection of guys who

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,240
figured out the exact tricks and you

45
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,960
know techniques to get laid so we had

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,840
the ogs like Neil Strauss and mystery

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,200
and some of the terms from this movement

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,040
are still in circulation today things

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,759
like approach anxiety body count neing

50
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,119
pickup lines Day game cold approach all

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,560
these terms came from that cultural

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,200
movement the Pua movement it even it

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,360
even went mainstream in 2005 2010 an

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Neil Strauss wrote the game in I think

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,880
2005 it's was a book very successful

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
book which brought in a whole new crowd

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,840
of young horny guys who wanted to get

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,400
laid at all costs mystery even had a

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,959
show on MTV back when MTV was still a

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,680
thing Barney Stinson from How I Met Your

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,760
Mother was a Pua so I started following

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
and learning this stuff back in the day

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,120
and the in the tail end of the movement

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,879
and the threads that already began to

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,040
unravel mystery lost his mind Neil

66
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,920
Strauss lost his soul and went through a

67
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,879
messy divorce every one of the OG pickup

68
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,280
artists is an absolute joke they're a

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,680
big deal back in the day but now they're

70
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,159
just done the Pua movement basically

71
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,000
defined man as he who sleeps with women

72
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,239
and the more women you slept with the

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,519
more of a man you were it was always a

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
shallow movement and the leaders of that

75
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,920
movement literally lost everything they

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,560
lost their reputation they lost their

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
wealth they lost their loved ones they

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,920
lost their sanity we even had other

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,239
clowns from this era we had R we and i i

80
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,440
r we actually became a Christian

81
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,440
repented everything he he stopped

82
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,120
selling all his courses and products and

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,400
everything like that and I don't know

84
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,040
what he's doing now right I don't follow

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,920
this stuff anymore but he he failed like

86
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,640
he's in a terrible mental state right

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,920
now then we had Rolo tomasi who he's old

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,000
now but he's still speaking about the

89
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,239
same topics that he spoke about back 10

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,280
years ago Rolo tomasi is also a spent

91
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,400
Force even so there are some gems from

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,319
this era this is one of my all-time

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,439
favorite books the book of pke written

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,080
by an anonymous author we don't know who

95
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,560
wrote this book and it's just great it

96
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,159
talks about frame in the correct way and

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
it doesn't treat women like a bunch of

98
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,159
mindless cattle to be slain but like I

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,760
said this movement was dying when I

100
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,400
joined it then it completely died it got

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,200
nuked when the gamergate event happened

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,799
so this gamergate event happened in 2015

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,799
and it was a ridiculously important

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,439
cultural event that may have been kind

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,400
of Forgotten today but it literally

106
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,159
shaped the Paradigm of the masculinity

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,439
movement that you are currently living

108
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,519
through this was the first clash between

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,120
feminism and the anti-feminism literally

110
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,640
caught fire right this is actually where

111
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,120
the term sjw comes from this is the

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,799
event that kicked off the whole

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,040
conversation about what it means to be a

114
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,600
man versus a woman in the modern

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,079
environment so you may have been too

116
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,280
young to appreciate the gamergate event

117
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,040
when it happened but basically a bunch

118
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,320
of radical feminists you know the blue

119
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,560
hair type they hijacked all the major

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,840
gaming related media outlets and they

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,720
made the case that Gamers men and the

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,199
entire industry was just sexist and

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,160
misogynist and oppressive and that all

124
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,479
games should include women and

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,520
minorities these harpies literally put

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,919
fake accusations on men and ruined lives

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,320
to make their case in fact the whole me

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,360
too movement is nothing but an echo of

129
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,199
gamergate I'm sure there were cases of

130
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,919
actual assault and harassment but to use

131
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,320
that as a political tool that's just

132
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,960
wrong right so the response to all this

133
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,520
was led by Sargon of aad and other

134
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,759
creators who used to get hundreds of

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,120
thousands of views by taking down the

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,759
feminists this new anti-feminist

137
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,039
movement defined man as he who does not

138
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,199
take from women as opposed to the

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,039
old Pua definition of he who beds the

140
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,600
most women the anti-feminist like Saron

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,960
of fad had become kind of the rulers of

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,400
the men's space in 2016 on YouTube then

143
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,880
a new man arose and a new vision arose

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199
From the Ashes of that Battlefield

145
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
Jordan Peterson had entered the chat the

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,240
bill c16 controversy got going around

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,000
the end of 2016 starting of 2017 and one

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,520
man arose to challenge this this man's a

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,560
straight G right from day one he was

150
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,319
impressive he had been developing his

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,600
mental fortitude and his skill at

152
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,560
speaking for decades as a professor he

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,360
was sharp he was refined he was

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,319
extremely well read to say the least he

155
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,680
knew the literature inside and out it's

156
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,319
very hard to debate a man like that his

157
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
views were aligned with the

158
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,360
anti-feminists but he diverged because

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,199
he was not an atheist he believed in God

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,520
believed in the Bible and said so talked

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,199
about it a lot so he defined man as he

162
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,360
who beared responsibility for himself

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,599
and others around him which is a huge

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,479
step up from the past definitions of man

165
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,479
for sure he basically dominated the

166
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,680
discourse and was the face of the

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,199
masculinity YouTube space for straight

168
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,199
two-year period 2018 is when he was in

169
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,880
his prime he was crushing it in his

170
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,360
debates his Industrial level demolition

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,560
of Kathy Newman was a piece of art worth

172
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,319
watching the entire interview you cited

173
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,720
freedom of speech in that why should

174
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,880
your right to freedom of speech Trump a

175
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,800
trans person's right not to be

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,599
offended because in order to be able to

177
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,919
think you have to risk being offensive I

178
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,960
mean look at the conversation we're

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,720
having right now you know like you're

180
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,680
certainly willing to risk offending me

181
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,240
in the pursuit of Truth why should you

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
have the right to do that it's been

183
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,879
rather

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,199
uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I

185
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,599
put you on the

186
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,479
spot I have my point you get my point

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,199
it's like you're you're doing what you

188
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,240
should do which is digging a bit to see

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
what the hell's going on and that is

190
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,120
what you should do but you're exercising

191
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,080
your freedom of speech to certainly risk

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,840
offending me and that's fine I think

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,879
more power to you as far as I'm

194
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,840
concerned so you haven't sat there

195
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,930
and I'm just trying I'm just trying to

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
work that out I mean

197
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,720
[Music]

198
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
H gotcha you have got me you have got me

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm trying to work that through my head

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
yeah yeah it took a while it took a

201
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,160
while did it did yeah up at the same

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,759
time he also had this Cambridge Hall

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,759
interview he won this debate basically

204
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,319
where they discussed the gender pay Gap

205
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,680
the feminists were intellectually

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,879
dominated by Peterson and he basically

207
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,919
showed that the anti-feminists actually

208
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,520
had something they they were talking

209
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,000
about actual legitimate um circumstances

210
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,440
which men were facing

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,520
men were really struggling to find

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,400
opportunity and meaning in life Peterson

213
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,680
moved the Overton window in the right

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,479
direction and laid the foundation for

215
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,639
the Hamza era he showed a problem he

216
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,159
showed that men are failing out they're

217
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,560
struggling to fix themselves they're

218
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,639
addicted to porn men aren't this

219
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,599
privileged oppressor class that and

220
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,800
misogynist that they made out to be in

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,879
fact depression rates and suicide was

222
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,440
actually higher in men men were less

223
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,159
than 40% of college graduates that they

224
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,919
don't make more money if you do the

225
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,279
statistical analysis correctly which of

226
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
course the feminists didn't bother to do

227
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,279
in fact men were in the worst place they

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,360
had been since the beginning of mankind

229
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,399
and unfortunately this is where Peterson

230
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
starts to lose his mind they had to

231
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,760
literally fly him to Russia for

232
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
immediate psychiatric help so he's out

233
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,880
of the game just as the pandemic starts

234
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
he's out of the game when people needed

235
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,279
him most he was out of the game this is

236
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,000
when men's mental health just falls off

237
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,959
a cliff right lockdown start isolation

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,360
happens

239
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,360
and there were some self-improvement

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
type channels out there but at this time

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,920
self-improvement was not linked to

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
masculinity the self-improvement

243
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,279
channels at this time were you know Ali

244
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,800
abdal there was um better ideas and

245
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,040
these guys would tell you to do the

246
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,680
right thing they would give you the

247
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,519
right information but they couldn't give

248
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,200
you inspiration and the world needed

249
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,800
inspiration and there arose Hamza Hamza

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
starts doing his gymnast ring workouts

251
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,560
in the park and showed that you didn't

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,399
need gyms you didn't need this

253
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,920
infrastructure to get jacked if you

254
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,480
wanted to put in the work you could find

255
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,959
a way to do so and when all these other

256
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,600
self-improvement guys were kind of

257
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,440
androgynous Hamza walks in looking like

258
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,920
a Chad takes YouTube by storm soon as

259
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,680
Hamza enters the fry everybody kind of

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,120
becomes irrelevant everybody becomes a

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,040
footnote to the rise of Hamza and it was

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,680
glorious Hamza took the wisdom of Jordan

263
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,720
Peterson and taught it in simple terms

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,399
that anybody can understand he had the

265
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,000
body for credibility he had the honesty

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,200
to show the inner workings of

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,680
self-improvement and mental health

268
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,160
Hamza defined man as he who does the

269
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,200
hard work especially when he doesn't

270
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
feel like it absolute Chad message

271
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,279
that's why we love Hamza ham started

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,600
getting serious momentum somewhere in

273
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,800
the um you know when he was 300,000

274
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,480
500,000 subscribers area he put out a

275
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,480
community post asking for applications

276
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,240
to be his thinker and you bet I jumped

277
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,480
on it like literally on the same day I

278
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,920
can still remember getting hamza's email

279
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,440
from his private email and I remember

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
thinking this is a golden opport

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,120
opportunity and it was for months I

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,720
worked with him and helped him get

283
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,880
closer to the 1 million uh subscribers

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,279
Milestone I would get up at 2:00 a.m. to

285
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
do calls with him because of the time

286
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,399
zone difference right he lived in UK I

287
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,839
lived in the US and and I I didn't see

288
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,680
it as a sacrifice I enjoyed it because I

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
believed in the mission I even did calls

290
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
with him during army training I would

291
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,120
sit on the top of my Hume and do calls

292
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,399
on Discord on my phone and this is when

293
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,639
Andrew Tate blows up the internet right

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,160
Andrew Tate Loki reprogrammed all our

295
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,399
minds including Hamas including mine and

296
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,560
sneo is just an extreme case of the

297
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,480
absolute power of persuasion that Andrew

298
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,320
Tate exemplifies the man's a genius to

299
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
your business and paired with the

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,760
speaking skills of a Roman orator plus

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,959
he was built like a draft horse of

302
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,800
course he was going to conquer the

303
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,680
internet and he did I still remember

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,760
discussing Tate with Hamza they we were

305
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
discussing whether you know Hamza should

306
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,079
publicly support Tate or we should just

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,079
ignore it at the time and we both were

308
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,720
fans the the sex allegations hadn't

309
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,839
dropped yet this was the end of hamza's

310
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,440
Golden Era where he made the best

311
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,880
content that he has ever made and even

312
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,360
then we were running out of topics he

313
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
had already covered the basics you know

314
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,040
covered working out meditation all this

315
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,959
we didn't know what to talk about next

316
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,880
at this time he was going hard against

317
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,360
the social media companies he got

318
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,680
canceled on Instagram he got cancelled

319
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,880
on skillshare and that's when we stopped

320
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,720
working with each other so let's do a

321
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,040
quick review Tate's a brilliant man who

322
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
sold his soul to the devil next we have

323
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
first man who cannot deliver on promises

324
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
to save his life we have sneo who's a

325
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
joke we have fresh and fit who's an even

326
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,480
worse joke we have CEO of testosterone

327
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
who is another Deen passport bro we have

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,560
Jordan Peterson who was truly brilliant

329
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,880
but now lies broken then finally we come

330
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,920
to Hamza Hamza is by far at this current

331
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,360
time the best influencer in this space I

332
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,680
know him personally he really does care

333
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,480
and he is actually the same on and off

334
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,440
camera this video will be me talking

335
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,079
directly to Hamza because I know he's

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,000
likely watching this and I will break

337
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,920
down the criticism into parts and

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,560
explain it clearly I'm not going to go

339
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
easy on you Hamza because of our past

340
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,440
friendship I'm going to be brutally

341
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,040
honest and you're just going to have to

342
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,240
deal with it first your handling of your

343
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,519
ex-girlfriend was hypocritical and

344
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,079
here's why you showed her on camera

345
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,079
literally a million guys knows what she

346
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,800
looked like you talked openly about how

347
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,160
you demolished her in bed and put her on

348
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,160
her knees and all this like graphic

349
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,320
detail it means a million guys have

350
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,279
visualized her getting real like

351
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,600
absolutely demolished that's that's the

352
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,199
level of a porn store you know what I

353
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,160
mean and you left her for even more

354
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,360
attractive

355
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,920
girls the problem isn't that you broke

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,240
up with the female like that happens

357
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,839
even with the best of intentions right

358
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,120
the problem is that you created another

359
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,560
Alpha Widow you created more degeneracy

360
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,720
on the on the society and you

361
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,240
potentially caus irreparable damage

362
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
because you wanted to party and be

363
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,360
social and do business you couldn't hold

364
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,040
commitment the problem is you talked

365
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,959
about having kids with her publicly even

366
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,839
and then you pulled the rug couldn't

367
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,800
couldn't go through with it right the

368
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,880
problem is that you were giving advice

369
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,560
on finding a wife and having a long-term

370
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
relationship when you didn't really know

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,320
anything about that topic you talk about

372
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,600
the degeneration of Western women but

373
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,839
you just created potentially one more

374
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,759
broken female you took a potential

375
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,880
traditional life as it were and made her

376
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,320
undatable and unmarriageable because any

377
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,160
man who wants to marry this chick right

378
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,079
is going to come across videos of you

379
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,040
talking her in the most sexual way now I

380
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,759
can understand completely that

381
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,639
relationships can fail and things happen

382
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,240
people drift away but to do this in

383
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,160
public does her more harm than does you

384
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,560
you talk about how she lost attraction

385
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,759
for you when you stopped acting like

386
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,040
James Bond and started being more

387
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,839
authentic to yourself you basically

388
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
saying that you need to play a character

389
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,560
to keep attraction but that's not

390
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,959
practical doesn't make sense because no

391
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
one can play a character forever to

392
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,480
summarize you clearly were giving out

393
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,000
advice in a very authoritative manner

394
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,040
like a teacher like a leader about a

395
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
topic that you were simply not an expert

396
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,880
on you were a student in that topic but

397
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,920
you speaking as though you were an

398
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,880
expert it's just the wrong thing to do

399
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,399
but it was done you shouldn't share

400
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,160
bedroom secrets about a girl online

401
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,519
that's just obvious at this point

402
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,040
shouldn't show her face and you've

403
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,040
basically allowed a million guys to

404
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,720
visualize her getting smashed right so

405
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,000
here's a recommendation obviously don't

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,480
do that and of course change out the

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,279
thumbnails where your old GF shows up

408
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,040
delete the videos which she actually

409
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,040
appears because it's not about you it's

410
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,320
about her dignity as a woman and here's

411
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,639
a personal prediction I don't know if

412
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,240
this will happen but I I think there's a

413
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,120
small chance that they do get back

414
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
together in the future but regardless

415
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,560
the second criticism that Hamza gets is

416
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,480
that he keeps on flip-flopping on his

417
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,199
views so you Hamza yes you change your

418
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,440
mind quite often that in itself is not

419
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,360
wrong but whenever people criticize you

420
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,399
saying you are always changing your mind

421
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,319
you've changed you always come back with

422
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,079
this NPC reply this kind of a

423
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,839
pre-programmed script saying oh bro you

424
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,160
haven't like that's some kind of Genius

425
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,000
comeback it's not a genius comeback it's

426
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,600
just a linguistic trick to avoid the

427
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,160
issue the accusation is that your ego is

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,720
too big and your NPC reply is yeah it's

429
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,720
because I'm so successful guys I make so

430
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,560
much money the recommendation I give you

431
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,000
is is stop calling yourself cult leader

432
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,279
that's where the problem truly arises

433
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,639
because otherwise people will understand

434
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,880
that you're just a a leader you know a

435
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,360
solid Man worth following but you're not

436
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,560
a cult leader right to call yourself a

437
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,319
cult leader it means you have to be

438
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,959
perfect you have to do everything

439
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,199
exactly correct because you're leading a

440
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,399
cult I think it's outlived its

441
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,000
usefulness right it's it's kind of

442
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,720
cringe at this point think about it when

443
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,199
you're 50 years of age are you still

444
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
going to be calling yourself a cult

445
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,720
leader probably not it'll be so stupid

446
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,600
if you're calling yourself 50 at 50 as a

447
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,360
cult leader so The Branding needs to

448
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,480
change and the cult leader thing has to

449
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,199
be phased out and the time for phasing

450
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
it out is right now while it's true that

451
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,440
different viewers want different things

452
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,759
and you cannot possibly please everybody

453
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,199
it wouldn't hurt to show viewers some

454
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,560
gratitude especially because you

455
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,680
pioneered the whole gratitude type

456
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,040
messaging on YouTube told us how it's

457
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,399
important to have gratitude for good

458
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,199
mental health if you show gratitude to

459
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,360
anything it has to be your viewers show

460
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,160
especially as you move on to a

461
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
businessman and you want to make

462
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,280
businessman SL entrepreneurship type

463
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,400
content the cult leader branding doesn't

464
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,280
even really help you or apply just take

465
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,120
it own back shoot it be done with it

466
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,199
finally go to Adonna school is is Hamza

467
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,480
a scammer is Adonis School a scam no

468
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,959
absolutely not Adonis school is a legit

469
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,120
product with tons of great content

470
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,679
inside the courses are legit the calls

471
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,720
are legit I've been in Adonis school

472
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,520
probably since day one Hamza added me to

473
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,160
it and I've learned enough from Adonis

474
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,799
school to build my own community and

475
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
courses so what's the future of the

476
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,240
masculinity movement I think in its

477
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,000
current form it's dead and think about

478
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,880
it it's not actually that masculine to

479
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,600
talk about masculinity 24/7 it's like

480
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,919
that old Marcus orus quote waste no more

481
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,080
time arguing what it means to be a good

482
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,160
man be one the modern version of this is

483
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,240
waste no more time arguing what a

484
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,600
masculine man should be B1 so that's

485
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,000
where we are at at the masculinity

486
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,840
movement it's kind of everything which

487
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,880
is supposed to be said has already been

488
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,000
said I think everybody kind of sick and

489
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,720
tired of the same old talking points and

490
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,320
we want to focus on a higher tier of

491
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,799
knowledge I've championed the esoteric

492
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,360
Health movement for a while but that's

493
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,200
only one aspect of it ham is essentially

494
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,280
going to be doing the business version

495
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,960
of this he's going to be providing

496
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,960
business knowledge that nobody else is

497
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,159
talking about I think it's very valuable

498
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,600
I think it's the right space to be in

499
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,919
for him the next wave of creators is

500
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,760
going to lead a new type of movement the

501
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,159
New Breed will be authentic but not

502
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,320
authentic for shock value the New Breed

503
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,679
will be polarizing but not to be

504
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,919
polarizing for its own sake I believe

505
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,120
that the next wave of creators will

506
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,080
speak more openly about religion and

507
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,760
prayer and I welcome this change and I

508
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,520
believe that the next generation of

509
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,360
creators will be more masculine without

510
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,559
yapping about masculinity 24/7 I want

511
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,360
real men who have actually lived life to

512
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,400
step up and start talking I want to hear

513
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,039
from Firemen police officers soldiers

514
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,760
doctors Engineers fathers grandfather s

515
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,520
plumbers electricians Lumberjacks and so

516
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,159
many life experiences which I've just

517
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,679
never had earlier in the video I talked

518
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,360
about how there's different definitions

519
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,039
of man and each of these movements had a

520
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,799
different definition well here's my

521
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,520
definition man is he who is capable of

522
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,600
reason and moral judgment man is he who

523
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,080
commands his Destiny to duty man is he

524
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,679
who Bridges the bestial and the Divine

525
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,559
and first and foremost man is he who

526
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,400
Masters himself I'm just sick and tired

527
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,640
of this whole masculinity movement it

528
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,559
feels like a lar you know what laring is

529
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,840
laring is basically when a bunch of guys

530
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,320
they pick up foam Shields and swords and

531
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,720
they do a mock battle and from afar it

532
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,039
might look like a real battle but when

533
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,799
you get close to it it's kind of a joke

534
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,080
that's what the masculinity movement is

535
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,640
slowly becoming and I'm just done with

536
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,159
it I reject it I'm just too old for it

537
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,039
and I ask the question what comes next

538
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,880
the movement of self-improvement and

539
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,120
masculinity is set to crumble under the

540
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
weight of his own contradictions the

541
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,960
self Improvement think about it

542
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,480
self-improvement is self-centered and

543
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
any man of true worth will be

544
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,039
dissatisfied with this and of course

545
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
speaking about masculinity all the time

546
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,080
isn't even that masculine so is the

547
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,039
Hamza era of self-improvement and

548
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,919
