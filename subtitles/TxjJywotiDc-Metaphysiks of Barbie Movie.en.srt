1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
the Barbie movie is a Greek tragedy

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,880
where Ken our tragic hero his Destiny is

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,340
thwarted by his one fatal flaw his

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,160
unrequited love for Barbie and his

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,560
overall naivete the movie even shows the

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,260
greatest flaw of democracy a secret

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,199
cabal of Elites can use psychological

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,660
manipulation to sow the seeds of sexual

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,119
confusion and use Warfare as a

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,519
distraction to seize the levels of power

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,320
there is even a scene straight out of

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,300
Fight Club in this movie in the Barbie

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,399
movie but my favorite scene is when Ken

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,739
says something along the lines of first

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,379
I thought the world was run by horses

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,079
and men but actually horses are just the

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,540
extenders of men is this not true is

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,340
this not Ken's blood memory boiling up

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,100
from the depth our horse is not the

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,719
extenders of men this is the Mythos of

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,840
the Bronze Age when men first

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,879
domesticated horses their speed was 10x

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,640
their deadliness in the battlefield was

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,820
10x they could travel 10x further their

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Dome main their conquest of land their

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,220
presence was 10xed is this not the

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
extension of man the world was indeed

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,200
created by men on Horseback from The

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,720
Chariot Lords of India to the

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,380
cataphractory of the byzantines to the

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,380
Polish Lancers to the step Warriors of

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,960
Genghis Khan to the Roman equities to

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,180
the saracens of salahuddin the world was

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
indeed shaped by men on Horseback was

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,799
not General Washington the finest

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,299
Horseman of his era could Alexander have

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,159
conquered the known world without

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,020
bucephalus I do not know if the

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,360
directors intended this movie to promote

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,159
the vision of Bronze Age Vitality but it

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,500
does just that and it does it perfectly

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,780
and I a scholar of Connecticut

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,700
philosophy will be your guide for those

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,500
who haven't watched this unintentional

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,960
Masterpiece I'll give you some context

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,360
so we start off our movie in Barbie land

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,340
where the Barbies the females own

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,140
everything they own all currency they

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,579
own all property they own basically

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,380
everything the Ken's basically don't

51
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,659
even have houses but the movie is not

52
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,360
stupid the movie doesn't portray this as

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,560
a feminist Utopia it clearly shows

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,479
through the use of irony that there's

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,180
some serious problems here they show how

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,099
vacuous the society is all the Barbies

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,200
do is party every single night there is

58
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,660
no need for water there's no need for

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,940
resources there is no birth and there is

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,099
no Decay There Is No Death and there is

61
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,860
nothing to fight for and there's nothing

62
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,620
to fight against here's a society where

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,099
nobody's life has any meaning this is a

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,379
realm of stagnation of infinite stasis a

65
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,959
land of never-ending triviality the

66
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,420
movie says every day is the perfect day

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
for Barbie but a day is only perfect for

68
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,700
Ken if Barbie looks at him and this is

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,620
how we meet Ken our protagonist Ken

70
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,319
begins his story arc as a simp

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,879
everything he lives for is Barbie's

72
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,060
attention so the Barbie universe is

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,379
basically reality and Barbie land and

74
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,940
whenever something bad happens in

75
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,459
reality that affects Barbie land so

76
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,620
basically the main Barbie Margot Robbie

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,000
has to go to reality in order to fix

78
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,060
whatever is going on there so that she

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,739
can come back perfect and on her way Ken

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,959
basically hides in her car and tries to

81
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,420
stow away with her to reality that's

82
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,040
basically like act one of this play for

83
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,260
act two Barbie and can have their first

84
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,819
experiences in reality and this is

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,680
actually done pretty cleverly I saw a

86
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,900
couple other reviews by the big name

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,580
right Wingers like freaking Shapiro and

88
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,599
they all start raging at this part of

89
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,040
the movie which doesn't make sense

90
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,319
because it's actually intelligently done

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,300
Margot Robbie has never had to hit

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
puberty because she just was a woman

93
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,680
from day one she's a doll but a real

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,780
woman's life is not like that there's a

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,760
genuine period of hardship and

96
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,879
misunderstanding and confusion with a

97
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,680
woman first hits puberty she has breasts

98
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,840
for the first time and this is not

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,760
something we men can kind of trivialize

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,099
it but we don't even understand the pain

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,200
slash discomfort of it but the fact of

102
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,500
the matter is when a young woman who's

103
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,879
basically a child she first develops you

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,620
know sexual features she starts to

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,900
become attractive to men for the first

106
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,580
time this can be a very difficult and

107
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,799
challenging experience for them and we

108
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,420
as men simply have no gauge to

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,299
understand that by so it makes perfect

110
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,980
sense that Margot Robbie Robbie when she

111
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,040
finds her way into reality I mean she's

112
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,599
looked on as a sexual object by men for

113
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,459
the first time she feels intensely

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,560
uncomfortable of course she does but

115
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,060
that being said there are some dumb like

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,160
feminist things added on which don't

117
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,900
make sense for example in broad daylight

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,400
in the middle of the park some guy comes

119
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,540
and slaps her in the ass like that's

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
another thing which really happens let's

121
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,440
be real and if that did happen other men

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,180
would beat him up for it but far more

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,220
interesting is of course the Ken plot

124
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,020
line so Ken goes on his own way in

125
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,900
reality and we the audience are treated

126
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,900
to an amazing Montage of Ken's

127
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,639
introduction to masculinity he goes

128
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,100
around the city and he sees men being

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
masculine you know he sees men sparring

130
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,020
fighting Being Fit he sees strong police

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,060
officers on Horseback maintaining Law

132
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,979
and Order he sees dollar bills with the

133
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,199
founding fathers of America stamped on

134
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,139
there for eternity he sees Cowboys and

135
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,320
horses he sees Golf and cars he sees

136
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,240
trucks and beer and Stallone and all the

137
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
cool things which make me love being a

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,900
man and this montage is actually really

139
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,639
really good like check it out and the

140
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,860
music is also perfect with it but it

141
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,900
does have one serious flaw you see Ken

142
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,060
hasn't spent much time in reality I just

143
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,820
only spent like half a day right so this

144
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,759
is the only angle of man that he sees

145
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,979
what he doesn't see of course is men

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,020
dying in needless Wars he doesn't see

147
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,940
firemen jumping through fires to save

148
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,280
innocent people and dying in the process

149
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,139
he doesn't see oil rig workers he

150
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,300
doesn't see plumbers electricians

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,280
linemen he doesn't see who cleans the

152
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,220
windows on skyscrapers he doesn't see

153
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,680
most of the sacrifices of man and this

154
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,240
naivete will come to bite him later and

155
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
the next scene is even better so he can

156
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,440
goes around in town trying to look for a

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,060
top job because he saw the Montage of

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,380
masculinity and he thinks that just by

159
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,419
being a man he's going to get a top job

160
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,580
he goes and tries to be a doctor he

161
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,740
doesn't have a license he goes to be a

162
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,539
banker he doesn't have an MBA he goes to

163
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,300
be a lifeguard and he he doesn't know

164
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,340
how to swim and men and women turn him

165
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,979
down at each of those places the lesson

166
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,780
to be learned here is men don't just get

167
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,120
things handed to them on a plate we

168
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,039
don't live in a dominance hierarchy we

169
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,180
live in a competence hierarchy it

170
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,560
doesn't matter if you're a man or woman

171
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,300
if you can't do the job then you don't

172
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
get the job and of course there's

173
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,120
nothing competent men despise more than

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,340
an incompetent man but sadly Ken doesn't

175
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,979
understand this he doesn't understand

176
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,560
that competence is a vital vital vital

177
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,020
important part of being a man and that's

178
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,699
what gets him actual respect you see a

179
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,280
little knowledge is a dangerous thing

180
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,840
and that is the tragedy of Ken and now

181
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,880
we go on to the Barbie side of the story

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,740
so Barbie has to go and find the human

183
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,780
who played with her basically what

184
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,460
happens in the story plot is when a

185
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,979
human is sad and playing with a Barbie

186
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,600
that manifests itself in Barbie life so

187
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,460
she has to find the human and then make

188
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,199
her happy in order to fix herself to go

189
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,259
back to Barbie land so she finds the

190
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,180
human she finds a mother-daughter Duo

191
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,979
and the mother is the actual human who

192
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,900
controls that Barbie or doesn't even

193
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,400
control but you know the feelings leech

194
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,319
onto the Barbie and then there's the

195
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,699
daughter who's just annoying as [ __ ] but

196
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,160
the mother is actually pretty decent but

197
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,800
meanwhile Ken has already gone back to

198
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,900
Barbie land think about this Ken thought

199
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,479
that the world was ruled by men in

200
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,419
reality but he still left it to go to

201
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,120
Barbie land to bring his new vision to

202
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,220
his comrades who just before he was

203
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,160
competing with with the Promethean fire

204
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,199
he harnessed from reality he goes to

205
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,599
Barbie land to bring his vision for the

206
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,880
future into fruition this is what is

207
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,860
meant by kennergy and at this time the

208
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,599
trio of Barbie and the mother and

209
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,639
daughter team are coming back to Barbie

210
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,500
land and now the movie really starts to

211
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,180
go The Barbers realized that the entire

212
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,340
Barbie land has been converted into

213
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,960
Kingdom and kendom is basically the

214
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,220
kingdom of the Kens there's horses

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,020
there's big ass trucks there's

216
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,180
attractive women everywhere everybody's

217
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,039
happy and having a great time and Ken is

218
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,620
explaining the things I told you before

219
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,660
you know he's explaining how horses are

220
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,940
men extenders and is is he not correct

221
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,639
from the Knights of the Round Table to

222
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,680
the pharonic Chariots of Egypt men on

223
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,080
Horseback built this world and indeed

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,680
the whole cowboy aesthetic are not

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,840
Cowboys emblematic of the urge of man to

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,360
expand past his borders into the unknown

227
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
to seize unknown riches and bring forth

228
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,280
a new future a new Destiny for his

229
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,500
people are not the Cowboys the poster

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,740
child of Bronze Age vitality and it's

231
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,360
not just men who like horses women love

232
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,000
horses have you ever talked to a woman

233
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,580
who's been raised around horses girls in

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,440
general love horses why because the

235
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,959
horse seen from the perspective of a

236
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,020
woman is a being of skull crushing power

237
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,839
this is the dream for most women is to

238
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,660
find a man who is immensely powerful and

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,880
whose power knows no bounds but to her

240
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,980
he is good kind and loyal that is the

241
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,440
imperative for a large fraction of women

242
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,060
no surprise then that all the Barbies of

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,640
Kingdom actually having a great time

244
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,580
they love the the change as it were lit

245
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,100
the president Barbie of barbieland says

246
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,779
she'd rather be serving beer than being

247
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
president it's in the movie I didn't

248
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,899
make it up but of course you know the

249
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,820
objection to that would be she's

250
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,860
brainwashed but we'll get to that soon

251
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,000
the psychological operations part of

252
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,380
this movie is actually the most

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,360
interesting I'll get to it don't worry

254
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,980
and here we are introduced to Alan

255
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,279
actually Alan shows up even earlier but

256
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,380
he's insignificant humans we're fine and

257
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,779
Ellen

258
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,660
you see Alan is the opposite of Ken

259
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,180
Allen is a weak jawed weak spine weak

260
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,700
Spirit worm of a man who is despised

261
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,560
equally by the Kent and Barbies alike

262
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,779
he's ignored by the Barbies as a

263
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,339
non-entity and he's disrespected by the

264
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,260
Kelsey Allen literally has to massage

265
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,820
Ken's feet and the philosophy behind

266
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,440
Alan is interesting too and we'll get to

267
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,959
that as well when the Barbies reach

268
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,000
Barbie's house they find Ken in there

269
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,800
and Ken has basically conquered that

270
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,040
space he's taken Barbie's house and

271
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,420
converted it into his Mojo Dojo Casa

272
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,160
house the mother and daughter team

273
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,440
object to this name they say you can't

274
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,420
say casa and Dojo if you're already

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,640
saying house but Ken just dismisses them

276
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,440
and says it sounds good and he asked

277
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,760
them to repeat it and they do and here's

278
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,380
an interesting scene actually the

279
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,420
mother-daughter team actually fall into

280
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,399
the trance they fall into Ken's command

281
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,560
prisons and they start calling it Mojo

282
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,440
Dojo Casa house they're only snapped out

283
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,420
of it by Barbie who wasn't in the trance

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,060
because she had known Ken before his

285
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,800
Ascension and there's some Banger lines

286
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,779
in this movie so Barbie finds out what

287
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,640
Ken has done and she starts crying and

288
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,680
throwing a fit and she says to Ken you

289
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,080
can't change society in a single day and

290
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,019
to that Ken says literally and

291
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,360
figuratively watch me that is a line

292
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,880
spoken by a man of action that is a line

293
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,880
spoken by a man of Destiny this is the

294
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,760
essence of canic energy he went from a

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,220
Barbie simp to the Lord of his land in a

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,740
day he became a Napoleon a Caesar

297
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,260
overnight if a doll could do it why not

298
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,880
you and if you feel like energy let me

299
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,680
know in the comments type out I feel

300
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,240
like energy everybody who does it gets a

301
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,339
heart from me and here's the thing about

302
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,440
kendom people aren't actually being

303
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,720
oppressed in Kingdom there is no threat

304
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,180
of physical violence and there's no sign

305
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,820
of psychological manipulation there's no

306
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,220
crime there's no harassment there's no

307
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,600
cat calling all the female Barbies are

308
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,760
essentially doing whatever it is that

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,260
they're doing on their own free will now

310
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
you can look at the movie and say this

311
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,519
is an undesirable state of events that's

312
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,680
fine but the factor of the matter is

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,000
this is not oppression this is free will

314
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
if you want to say that women can do

315
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,600
whatever they want and they choose

316
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,579
voluntarily to serve beer and appear

317
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,860
attractive that's on them that's up to

318
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,600
them and multiple Barbies say that they

319
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,519
like this state of affairs more than the

320
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,440
previous one the president Barbie says

321
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,959
it one of the physicist Barbies say it

322
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,700
the general consensus is that Ken made

323
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,200
the world better for them you see this

324
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,420
is what feminists don't really

325
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,899
understand men and women actually get

326
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,120
along just fine 99 of the time we like

327
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,740
women women like us there's a certain

328
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,660
kind of dance which goes around between

329
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,579
the Sexes you have to show that you have

330
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,320
attraction but you can't do too much of

331
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,420
it otherwise you look too available but

332
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,519
this is a dance which the feminists are

333
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,019
not invited to they don't understand it

334
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,760
they perceive that whenever a woman is

335
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,500
dressed attractively she's doing so

336
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,360
because of brainwashing or oppression

337
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,060
this is not true and they perceive men

338
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,980
being loud or Brash as a part of the

339
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,200
patriarchy or oppression this is also

340
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,000
not true women do absolutely go out of

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
their way to appear attractive to men

342
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,779
which they are interested in and men

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,060
obviously do the same exact thing this

344
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,920
is as nature intended and this is what

345
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,899
the feminists hate and how do we know

346
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,339
that Ken didn't Brainwashed the Barbies

347
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,200
we actually know the movie actually

348
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,180
tells it Ken actually says that all he

349
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,760
had to do was explain the immaculate

350
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,100
logic of patriarchy his lines not mine

351
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,959
and Society followed his vision that's

352
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,940
not brainwashing that's called giving a

353
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,860
speech to the masses and convincing them

354
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,660
of your ideals now you can disagree with

355
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,220
the ideals that's fine but that's not

356
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,200
called brainwashing that's called giving

357
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,760
a speech later on in the movie you'll

358
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,680
see what real brainwashing looks like

359
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,440
and it's the Barbies who do it and now

360
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,320
on to the interesting part the secretive

361
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,839
cabal so Barbie the mother and daughter

362
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,940
and a couple other discontinued Barbies

363
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
so the the kind of like the rejects of

364
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,200
society Barbies they form this cabal

365
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,180
this secretive organization and they

366
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,100
want Barbie land to be restored to the

367
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,180
old Barbie land before Kingdom but they

368
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,279
don't know how to do it and they're

369
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,839
frustrated what happens at this point is

370
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,000
the mother right the mother from that

371
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,700
mother daughter Duo she's had enough she

372
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,560
freaks 7 gives a monologue a speech and

373
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,000
the speech honestly wasn't that bad it

374
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,740
was actually pretty decent and I know

375
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
this speech did really well in feminist

376
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,760
circles which is fine because it was a

377
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,160
genuinely valuable speech it talks about

378
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,899
the pressure put on women which I agree

379
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,180
with if you think men are under pressure

380
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,680
women are also under pressure and it's

381
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,300
actually worse for them because at least

382
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,040
we kind of know what success looks like

383
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,480
for us but for women it's a double

384
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,540
standard it's kind of terrible actually

385
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,399
we judge women using masculine metrics

386
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,019
Society tells a young woman she has to

387
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,600
make money she has to own stocks and

388
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,459
bonds and certificates of deposit and

389
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,279
all the things which men used to do she

390
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,680
has to make big decisions but also she

391
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,320
has to be a mother and a caregiver this

392
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,139
is not reasonable we're asking too much

393
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,700
of women in society we're enforcing two

394
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,260
different metrics on one side we're

395
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,360
giving them the masculine metrics to

396
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,040
Aspire to and the other side the

397
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,600
biological imperatives of women still

398
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,920
stand they still want to be mothers they

399
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,660
still want to be Caregivers for their

400
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,579
children and every promotion you get

401
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,680
every other hour you spend working is

402
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,300
one hour less from your child the women

403
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,579
find themselves in a very unfortunate

404
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,680
position they find themselves trapped

405
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,480
and exhausted and they're always tired

406
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,399
because we're asking too much of them

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,440
this is an absolutely ridiculous State

408
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,240
of Affairs the movie does a good job of

409
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,060
pointing it out but of course it doesn't

410
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,500
put any of the responsibility on the

411
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,360
feminist movement I'm not saying

412
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,279
feminism is to blame for all the ills of

413
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,079
society that's unreasonable but to some

414
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,639
extent they do have to take some of the

415
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,680
responsibility that being said most

416
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,779
responsibility is not with the feminists

417
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,240
it's actually with certain decisions

418
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,220
made by certain people in certain parts

419
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,380
of government which I won't get into too

420
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,600
deeply in this video think about who

421
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,540
actually won out in the feminist moment

422
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,639
was it real women I'm not so sure a

423
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,860
woman now has to do both the job Alpha

424
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,899
mother and also the nine to five as the

425
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,000
average woman did not really win under

426
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,980
feminism I'm sure their lives improved

427
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,500
in some important metrics I agree with

428
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,300
that but the real winners were the

429
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,639
corporations weren't they because now

430
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,500
men and women both are competing for the

431
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,540
same position so the labor market

432
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,100
basically doubled overnight and when you

433
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,860
have intense competition for the same

434
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,079
exact resources the price for that

435
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,360
resource drops so corporations can get

436
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,760
away with paying low salaries which is

437
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,620
exactly why you need a man and a woman

438
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,079
both working in order to support a child

439
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,060
so the real winners of feminism wasn't

440
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,920
the females or the freaking corporations

441
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,779
but of course this movie was made by a

442
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,399
corporation so I don't expect that to be

443
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,779
brought up now comes a really

444
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,180
interesting part of the movie where they

445
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,459
dissect the biggest fragilities of

446
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,500
democracy the first one is the

447
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:57,240
manipulation of mass democracy by a

448
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,120
secret cabal what happens in this part

449
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,160
of the movie is basically the cabal of

450
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,320
Barbies the disfigured Barbies like the

451
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,199
mother the child and the freaking main

452
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,420
Barbie Margot Robbie they go into Barbie

453
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,300
land and they start kidnapping Barbies

454
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,699
against their will and indoctrinating

455
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,019
them against what they believed in and

456
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,000
they've basically force feed them

457
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,519
feminism until they become feminists

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,860
this is called brainwashing and this is

459
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,899
what the Kabbalah does the cabal

460
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,399
basically organizes a well-structured

461
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,639
deliberate plan of psychological

462
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,500
operations to use against the Barbies to

463
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,180
make them all into feminists of course

464
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,980
in real garments they don't necessarily

465
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,139
have to kidnap people and indoctrinate

466
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,000
them there's better more efficient ways

467
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,639
of doing things but still the analogy

468
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,160
strolls well you know any democracy

469
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,019
needs to be very careful that a cabal of

470
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,759
special interest groups doesn't

471
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,240
brainwash the population into doing

472
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,040
their bidding and then War needless War

473
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,839
Between Brothers this is also a

474
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
brilliant part of the movie so before we

475
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,360
get to there the newly feminist Barbies

476
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,100
each of them seduce one can each so

477
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,899
they're all sitting in like a big Gaggle

478
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,640
and every single Ken is being

479
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,319
manipulated by one Barbie and they

480
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,720
literally say this in the movie they

481
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,459
tell the Barbies to act as though

482
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,040
they're interested in their respective

483
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,260
Ken's and when the Kens are truly

484
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,339
feeling comfortable they genuinely feel

485
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,799
that they're getting the attention of

486
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,799
the woman who they love that's when they

487
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,260
go and swap partners to cause the cancer

488
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,079
to become jealous of each other to feed

489
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,179
their insecurities in order to seize the

490
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,860
levels of power this literally happens

491
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,260
in the movie and this is portrayed in

492
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,120
the movie as good and just but I see it

493
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,860
for exactly what it is we just deceit

494
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,660
and manipulation so this movie is

495
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,820
actually brilliant it shows young men

496
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,160
that even at the peak of their

497
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,140
performance they should always be wary

498
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,880
of manipulation not only by women but

499
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,580
also by anybody in general so the secret

500
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,220
cabal has sown the seeds of sexual

501
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,860
dysfunction and sown the seeds of War

502
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,440
and the next day the cans go to war

503
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,520
these cans were just best friends so

504
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,620
because of the psychological

505
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,500
manipulations now they're at War and the

506
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,600
war is to no purpose except that the

507
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,160
Kent are distracted when the kids are

508
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,900
distracted the Barbies want to go and

509
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,760
set up a new constitution so think about

510
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,160
that very carefully does this not happen

511
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,539
in real life are some Wars not just

512
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
distractions and psychological

513
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,640
operations do governments not cause

514
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,320
unnecessary Bloodshed and suffering just

515
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,020
so that they remain in power for a few

516
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,400
more years is this not a dire warning to

517
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,679
every single democracy that has ever

518
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,299
existed since the dawn of Athens to the

519
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,919
birth of the United States that the

520
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,140
citizenry must be very careful as to

521
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,320
what wars they enter into and every war

522
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,419
spills valuable and valorous blood while

523
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,520
the Gremlins and politicians sit back in

524
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,140
their Ivory palaces and count their

525
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,539
dollar bills and then we have a

526
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,520
brilliant scene which is literally copy

527
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,260
and paste from Troy the movie about the

528
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
Trojan War and at this point I think the

529
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,380
director knows what she's doing I think

530
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,880
she literally is trying to promote a

531
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,740
vision of Bronze Age Vitality because

532
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,980
why else would you use literally the

533
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,320
Trojan War and of course Troy Troy Ilyas

534
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,440
Ilion oh well however you want to say it

535
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,720
Ilion is a Trojan word for Troy it's

536
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,620
literally called the land of horses so

537
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,020
Ken he and his Navy they Beach on Ken's

538
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,880
Beach and the other Kens the opposite

539
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,740
side of Ken's they're holding the beach

540
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,140
and they have this violent battle

541
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,720
straight out of the Trojan War Ken is

542
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,059
Achilles and the other can the Asian can

543
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,860
he is Hector and Hector and achilles

544
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,500
face off and pitched battle in single

545
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,440
combat but unlike in the Trojan War they

546
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,660
realize thankfully that the war was set

547
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,100
up by the powers that be and they don't

548
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,200
really hate each other they're just

549
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,880
pawns manipulated by the machine and

550
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,919
they come together they hold hands and

551
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,539
they are brothers and when all the cans

552
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,340
realize the manipulation which has

553
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,260
happened that the Barbie set them up

554
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,539
just as a destruction so that they could

555
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,340
change the Constitution They Ride

556
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,200
against the capitol they go to the

557
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,539
Barbies to see what's changed and here

558
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,000
the movie gets even better so we have

559
00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:00,179
all the kids recently bloodied from this

560
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,740
war ready to fight they realize that the

561
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,720
Barbies have taken their power through

562
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,360
the use of manipulation and at first

563
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,880
when Ken sees this treachery he's up in

564
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,919
arms he rages at this he calls out to

565
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,260
his brothers and they link arms in

566
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,880
Shield wall formation ready to besiege

567
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,160
the capital ready to take back their

568
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,919
power but now he doesn't know what to do

569
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,260
can he use the force of violence against

570
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,600
females and you see the female emails

571
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,100
may have used sexual manipulation and

572
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,260
psychological operations against the

573
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,840
Kent But Ken is a honorable man he

574
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,340
cannot use violence against women and in

575
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,620
fact they show this in the movie so one

576
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,600
of the Kents asks the main Ken who are

577
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,360
we attacking sir and Ken doesn't have an

578
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,700
answer and this is where the Epic Greek

579
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,460
tragedy part of this movie sits in at

580
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,200
this point Ken capitulates he breaks

581
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,660
down but anybody who's watching this

582
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,700
movie closely understands that he was

583
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,340
this close to snapping on the other side

584
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,960
the canarchic revolution almost happened

585
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,820
all he had to do was give the command

586
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,160
and the chems could have taken Kingdom

587
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,600
and deposed of democracy and they could

588
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,460
have had all the power the only reason

589
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,740
they didn't do this is because they were

590
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,080
Men of Honor and Men of Honor do not use

591
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,840
physical violence on women and so the

592
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,880
tragedy of Ken unfolds a man on the path

593
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,940
of ascent is brought Low by his one

594
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,820
fatal flaw his naivete of human nature

595
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,740
and his undying love for his women even

596
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,600
at this point Ken could have gathered

597
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,580
all the other kins and then gone to a

598
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,679
different place and set up a new kingdom

599
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,960
there he could have even ventured into

600
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,840
reality and set up a new kingdom in

601
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,880
reality but sadly he does not do this he

602
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,280
doesn't have the wisdom he had the

603
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,020
strength he had the Primark Aura he had

604
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,600
everything he needed to start a new

605
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,460
kingdom but he didn't have the wisdom to

606
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,740
know how to do it that's a beautiful

607
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,360
tragedy and a Learning lesson for every

608
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,860
young man who aspires for the greater

609
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
things in life and if you agree with

610
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,039
this message I want to see in the

611
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,360
comments Ken did nothing wrong you might

612
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,100
think that the juicy part of the movie

613
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,380
is over but not so there's actually more

614
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,020
stuff coming up so what happens now is

615
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,299
Barbie goes and visits the beaten and

616
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,559
broken Ken and delivers lines straight

617
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,780
out of Fight Club she says something

618
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,820
along the lines of you are not the

619
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,740
clothes you wear you are not your

620
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,260
girlfriend you are not the job you do

621
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,840
and this every man's job to find out who

622
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,299
he truly is Tyler Durden Fight Club says

623
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,220
the exact same thing you are not the job

624
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,020
you have you are not the amount of money

625
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,880
you have in your bank you are not the

626
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,919
car you drive and you are not the

627
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,900
contents of your wallet you are not your

628
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,520
[ __ ] khakis is the message of this

629
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,860
movie much different from that I'm

630
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,559
telling you right now Barbie movie is

631
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,480
The Fight Club of 2023. we are not prone

632
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,159
to manipulation and we understand how

633
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,380
these games are played and at this point

634
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,120
Ken's story arc is essentially complete

635
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,220
he realizes that Barbie doesn't give a

636
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,080
single [ __ ] about him and he goes on on

637
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,700
his own to find his own meaning which is

638
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,320
cool and then Barbie's story is still

639
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,980
unconcluded and then we have freaking

640
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,900
Alan See Alan did not participate in the

641
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,000
Battle of Ken's Beach Island being the

642
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,679
wimp that he was was despised by the

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,419
Kens and therefore he went on to the

644
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,159
Barbie's side and the Barbies of course

645
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,240
just ignored him you see this is an

646
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,700
important message which I have to give

647
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,500
to women and surprisingly I bought 10 of

648
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,539
the audience is actually female it's not

649
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,039
the Kens of the world that are the

650
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,500
actual threat to you understand this

651
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,240
very carefully a good looking man who is

652
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,580
already well off well-adjusted

653
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,500
pre-sociable is not the one who's going

654
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,960
to harass you he might try to flirt with

655
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,059
you you may not like that and hell he

656
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,039
might even be annoying to you but he's

657
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,039
not gonna harass ask you he's not going

658
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,000
to be a physical threat to you Allen's

659
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,640
on the other hand are a different

660
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,220
problem you see Allens won't flirt with

661
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,080
you Allens will not even show you that

662
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,940
they're interested Allens will use

663
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,179
psychological tactics they'll be your

664
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,220
friend but when no one's looking it's

665
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,559
the alliance who actually commit crimes

666
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,840
be very careful when a man says that

667
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,220
he's a feminist be very careful and go

668
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,659
in the opposite direction you see this

669
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,059
movie does a very good job of showing

670
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,400
male naivete it shows how men can be

671
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,200
very prone to manipulation by women but

672
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,299
of course the opposite also true men

673
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,640
also try to manipulate women that's also

674
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,260
a thing and it's the islands which try

675
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,940
to manipulate women and the ending of

676
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,260
the movie is actually pretty good for

677
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,299
the first time I see an ostensibly

678
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,520
feminist movie actually promoting

679
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:09,780
motherhood what happens is the movie

680
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,700
makes it very clear that pursuing

681
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,020
motherhood is not a bad thing which I'm

682
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,240
really happy to see that the movie

683
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,280
clearly says yes of course carriers are

684
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,780
options for women by the end of the day

685
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,220
they can choose to be a mother and

686
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,659
that's perfectly fine I would actually

687
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,820
go one step further and say actually

688
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,500
motherhood is the most sacred and most

689
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,880
honorable Duty and maybe feministic will

690
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,380
disagree with me on that but I don't

691
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,600
care what they say really at the final

692
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,059
scene of the movie Barbie goes to a

693
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,120
gynecologist which implies that perhaps

694
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:37,679
she will eventually if she wants to be a

695
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,059
mother it's very nice to see a movie

696
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,559
that actually promotes that kind of

697
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,419
thing because most young women think

698
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,220
that being a mother is a second tier

699
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,020
activity to actually getting a career

700
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm happy to see that young women now

701
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,600
see that being a mother could be

702
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,760
actually considered the tier one

703
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,380
activity and being a career woman is

704
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,840
actually beneath that and for all these

705
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,760
reasons I give this movie five Bronze

706
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,260
Age chariots out of five if you're

707
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,640
interested in high level discussions

708
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,740
like these then you should consider

709
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,900
joining my country club a private

710
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,880

711
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,860

712
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,320
know about esoteric Health methods and

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,100
philosophy history economics you name it

715
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,780
these are the things which aren't taught

716
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,340
to you even at the University level

717
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,159

718
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,440
dangerous say bye to the camera B my B
