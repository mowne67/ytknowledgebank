1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
what if I shot your dog would that be

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,319
insignificant all these nerds bro Neil

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,120
deGrasse Tyson Bill Nye Richard Dawkins

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,740
Stephen Hawkins all these guys they

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,660
always talk about the cosmic

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,700
insignificance of everything they talk

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,400
about how we're just one more species

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,500
one more evolved ape among a million

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,939
other species in the galaxy and I said

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,439
you know a thousands thousand stars

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,539
there's a thousand thousand planets and

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,920
just one more species and everything is

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,599
so insignificant but that should be

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,939
inspiring and that should help us

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,640
improve our species for some reason I

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,100
call it BS completely on this regardless

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,020
of what they say we should focus on what

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,120
they will actually do their actions

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,219
speak louder than words and that's true

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,840
for anybody including scientists if I

21
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,300
decided to walk into Stephen Hawking's

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
room and shoot his dog

23
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,160
yeah yeah still right it's all right

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,719
kind of yeah where was I

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,860
um if I walked in this room kicked him

26
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,420
off his wheelchair and shot his dog

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,300
using Stephen Hawking would talk about

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,640
Cosmic insignificance no because for

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,100
every person their own life and the

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,120
lives around them are of course

31
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,799
significant and perhaps we don't want to

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,119
be so negative speaking about harm done

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,260
to others perhaps we want to speak about

34
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,299
the positive

35
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,760
a few weeks ago there was an old woman

36
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,280
trying to carry up a heavy suitcase up a

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,720
flight of stairs and I saw this and

38
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,340
without even thinking about it I just

39
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,979
picked it up took it up the stairs it's

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,600
just a few stairs and you know I went

41
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,280
about my day without really thinking too

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,540
much about it but now when I consider it

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,180
I realize probably nobody saw my act of

44
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,580
kindness as it were and even I myself

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,360
would have forgotten it but perhaps to

46
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,340
her

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,259
the act of kindness was quite

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,659
significant because for her that

49
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,180
struggle was quite a struggle and my

50
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,979
gesture of kindness made her day

51
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,960
so just because there are stars in the

52
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,939
sky and planets that revolve around them

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,860
is it fair to say that such acts of

54
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,540
kindness are insignificant just because

55
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,340
they're scaled down

56
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,840
I disagree and I think that if you look

57
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,259
into your soul and into your bones

58
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,840
you'll find that even the smallest acts

59
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,979
of kindness are as significant as the

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,979
birth of our universe

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,260
all right
