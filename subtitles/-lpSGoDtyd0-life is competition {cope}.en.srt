1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,560
they say that hope flation is when a man

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,240
today needs to work 20 times harder than

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,559
his grandfather to get a girl 20 times

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,160
worse than his grandmother but nobody is

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,360
talking about Chad flation Chad flation

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
is when men today need to work 20 times

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,800
harder to be just 20% of the man their

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,680
grandfather was it appears today we need

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,240
to do more work than ever and have less

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,080
time than ever and we still don't hit

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,560
the Milestones of success that our

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
grandfathers and fathers did finding a

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,759
wife and actually having kids owning a

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,000
house going on vacation every year

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,600
comfortably these things were considered

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,600
average as recently as the '90s in just

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,399
30 years Everything Has Changed

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,640
certainly there is a political and

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,440
economic angle to all this and I will

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,120
cover that in future videos but today

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,760
we're going to talk about the biologic

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,000
and genetic competition the chief tenant

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,680
of the religion of the red pill is that

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,039
male life is Relentless competition that

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,640
if you aren't obsessing over the Holy

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,600
Trinity of looks money and status then

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,159
you are worthless but is this true is

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,680
competition really everything let's look

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,840
to Nature let's take a rose plant and

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,040
let it grow in a pot with plenty of

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,680
sunshine water and soil let's take a

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,759
second roast plants that's genetically

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,880
identical to the first one and put it in

34
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,079
a pot alongside three other Rose plants

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,880
which one do you think will grow taller

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,960
which one do you think will produce more

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,840
flowers which one do you think will have

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,640
bigger leaves which one do you think

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
will have sharper Thorns the answer is

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
obvious the plant that has has no

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,880
competition the plant that has space to

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,799
grow and hone the full use of its powers

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,240
the plant that doesn't have to fight for

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,479
every scrap of nutrition that's the

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
plant that's going to win out the rose

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,759
plant that avoided brutal competition

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
for resources was the one with more

48
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,479
Beauty and indeed sexual power in the

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,200
form of bigger flowers not only that but

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,759
it also has sharper Thorns by which it

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,280
can defend itself in other words it's a

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,399
superior specimen but we're told that

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
competition

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,520
is always good red pill nerds will often

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,920
use evolutionary biology to make their

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,840
points without understanding what

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,520
they're speaking of they claim that the

58
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,440
purpose of life is reproduction and that

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,280
looks money and Status are proxies for

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,040
Reproductive success and since the

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,120
purpose of life is nothing more than

62
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,640
just reproduction LMS is an indicator of

63
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,160
selfworth again let's look to Nature

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,400
what happens when you take Noble

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,480
creature like Bengal tiger or snow

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,440
leopard of Tibet great elk of the Rocky

67
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,040
Mountains or the gray wolves of Germania

68
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,879
and you put them into an artificial

69
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,959
habitat you can give them everything

70
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,840
they could possibly desire Limitless

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,560
food complete protection from predators

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,319
you can give them medical care you can

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
give them new mates but don't have

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,680
reproduction noble animals do not

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,400
reproduce in captivity any form of

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,000
higher life is stunted when it lives in

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,159
owned space even mice stop reproducing

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,080
in captivity as we see in the mouse

79
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,000
Utopia experiments and we're told that

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,760
reproduction is the purpose of life but

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,480
it's clear from these observations and

82
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,840
more that we are missing something let's

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,840
look at humans in South Korea they have

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,400
food they have water they have shelter

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,040
they have medicine they have technology

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,480
they have all the material means to

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,720
reproduce but they're well on the way to

88
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,840
Extinction we're in a bizarre situation

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,280
where North Korea and South Korea have

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,840
the same birth rate despite radically

91
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,680
different material possessions again I

92
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,599
thought reproduction was the Prime

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,280
driver of life is this not true these

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,040
are observations that are plain to see

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,840
and you do not need to study biology for

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
6 years to understand that we have a

97
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,080
cultural misunderstanding of what life

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,439
is for and what competition does to the

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
individual life under Relentless Zero

100
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,439
Sum competition does not produce Beauty

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,079
in form or function I'm telling you all

102
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,879
this because mindset matters your

103
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,640
internal monologue determines your

104
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,120
overall mental state your interpretation

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,920
of Life determines your stress response

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,480
your understanding of the purpose of

107
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,760
life shapes your decision making this is

108
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,200
not an abstract philosophy video this is

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,319
tied to your life in the Here and Now

110
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,280
obviously a certain amount of

111
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,560
competition in a narrow domain of life

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
can be a driver towards Excellence I'm

113
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,320
not going to insult your intelligence by

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,639
going on about how competition can be

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,600
good in sports or business you're smart

116
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,000
enough to know that it's a matter of the

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,479
dose makes the poison my central point

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,360
is if you believe yourself to be a rat

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,240
in a rat race then you are going to have

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
rat biology you're going to have the

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,320
hormonal and neuronal Frameworks of a

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,960
rat a prey animal you're going to live

123
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,560
in a scarcity mindset always unsure of

124
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,080
advancement always skittish always

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,400
asking for permission we live in the

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,639
anxious generation responding to the

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,840
pressures of our environment and this

128
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,320
fear of missing out this constant

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,199
longing for being respected this is the

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,960
biology of the nerd the office Clerk and

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,000
the peon there's two ways the mindset of

132
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,360
splits version one that we just

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,680
discussed is the rat mentality which is

134
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,080
basically one I'm in competition with

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,120
all other men for resources and women

136
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,400
and two my self-worth is determined by

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,720
how others see me in comparison to thems

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,960
version two what I want to ascribe to is

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,080
the lion mentality which is I am an end

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,600
onto myself I will take life in my jaws

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,720
and two my selfworth is determined by

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,520
how I see myself in comparison to my

143
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,120
innate potential both these versions can

144
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,319
absolutely work brutally hard on

145
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,880
themselves and gain success but there is

146
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,120
a difference in the outcome rat

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,720
mentality man will always struggle to

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,479
find self-worth and will spend his life

149
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,000
looking for self-worth inside his bank

150
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,639
balance or between the legs of women

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,240
while lion mentality men is on a

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,120
different Quest he's on a quest not for

153
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,240
self- words but rather on a search for

154
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,160
deeper meaning and the unique expression

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
of his Divine talents

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
this is a noble life Quest and results

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,199
in the building of True Legacy even when

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,400
it comes to dating what kind of man sees

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
dating as brutal competition it's not

160
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,479
the man who gets girls easily the

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Carefree man the man who is self-

162
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,919
assured he sees himself as above the

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,599
competition and has the competitive

164
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
Advantage this is ironic but it's true

165
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,080
I've experienced this myself and I'm

166
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
sure you have seen it play out that a

167
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,919
man only gets women when he stops

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,919
obsessing over them the whole red pill /

169
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,160
pickup artist space is dominated by guys

170
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,199
who weren't good with women when they

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
were young so they had to develop these

172
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,880
complicated philosophies and doctrines

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
by which to unlock some the

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,720
success of this movement is dubious

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,479
because even when they succeed they fail

176
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,039
their self-worth is determined by how

177
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,319
well they can compete for and

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,560
since no matter how good a man's game is

179
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,919
or how much look maxing he does it's not

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
going to work on every single women and

181
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,960
this chips away at his self-worth and

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,720
also his perception of women he's no

183
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,759
longer able to enjoy relationships

184
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,240
because in his mind he's always anxious

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
always thinking about how the next guy

186
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,919
is going to steal his girl away because

187

genuinely successful with women to the

192
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,199
point of actually getting married and

planning kids don't think like this they

194
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,759

monkey branching or any of these dark

196
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,960
Concepts they focus on their mission

197
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,560
they focus Fus on their Fitness and they

198
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,759
focus on their Community girls can't get

teal one of the greatest technology

206
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,680
entrepreneurs of Our Generation on par

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,199
with Elon Musk said that competition is

208
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,120
for losers what did he mean by this his

209
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,120
main point was that business that find a

210
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,080
way to provide value in a unique way

211
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,599
will outperform businesses that are in

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
the blob of the competitive market only

213
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,720
a business that has freed itself from

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,360
the day-to-day competition can have a

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,599
genuine long-term vision and can afford

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
to place bets on projects that will bear

217
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,440
fruit in decades rather than months is

218
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,960
this not true of us as men if you have

219
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,039
true faith in your innate ability then

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,639
you owe it to yourself to see yourself

221
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,879
as higher than the steaming rat pile of

222
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,560
competition you rise above about the

223
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,760
swarming masses who sacrifice everything

224
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,399
to get a few more points on their exams

225
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,320
or lie on their resume to get the job

226
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,440
you need to find your own unique

227
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,599
competitive advantage and free yourself

228
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,959
from the psychological snare that

229
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,760
society and even your parents might trap

230
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,040
you in now the response to this is well

231
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,399
not everybody has that high level of

232
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,040
innate potential and that is true but

233
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,079
here's the thing only a very specific

234
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,519
type of man or women can watch this kind

235
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,959
of video this is a niche Channel with a

236
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,600
narrow appeal the topics I choose the

237
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,680
vocabulary I use the Aesthetics only

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
appeal to a certain type of person that

239
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,959
I care about communicating with this

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
Focus gives me a very valuable audience

241
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,440
from a business perspective it's nice

242
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,920
cuz I can make a good income without

243
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,920
Fame but more importantly I can

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,279
confidently say that every man or woman

245
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,279
watching this is guaranteed to be a

246
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,279
person of high potential it's

247
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,959
mathematically impossible for this to be

248
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,640
otherwise for high potential folk

249
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,720
competition is only a tool and it can

250
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,000
only be used to an extent competition is

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,760
amazing if you're okay with failure

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,959
remember failure is an event not a

253
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,880
person if you can remember this then

254
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,480
competition becomes nothing more than a

255
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,279
tool to hone your skills I'm not against

256
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,920
competition as such just that I believe

257
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,720
that having an antifragile psyche comes

258
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,040
first in fact this is actually part one

259
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,519
of a two-part series the next video I'm

260
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,279
going to share with you a tool called

261
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,320
the ud demonic Compass this tool helps

262
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,519
you make decisions with with confidence

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,959
and follow through with conviction this

264
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,320
is important because we all make choices

265
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,000
but in the end our choices make us so

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
I'll have the thumbnail pop up so you

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,519

268
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,600
knowledge and have access to the

269
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,600
actionable steps
