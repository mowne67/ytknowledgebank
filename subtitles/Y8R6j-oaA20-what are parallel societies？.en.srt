1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
have you ever heard of parallel

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,100
societies and parallel institutions well

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,480
of course that's the question jelly

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,220
mobile asks me so do you know what

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,019
parallel lines are parallel lines are

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,400
lines which never intersect they never

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,960
conflict they never cut each other

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,759
that's exactly what it is with parallel

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
societies but a group of people in a

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,779
society lose trust in the mainstream

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,279
narrative they form their own systems

12
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,039
their own beliefs and their own

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,840
practices and thereby form a parallel

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,220
Society they don't seek to conflict with

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,720
the mainstream they just want to do

16
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,160
their own thing sounds familiar doesn't

17
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,320
it so if you want a full video on that

18
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,820
let me know who TFS Daniel asks about

19
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,440
pesticides and Foods well the first

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,059
thing you gotta know is blueberries so

21
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,280
blueberries are highly nutritious for

22
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,600
you but they're coated in pesticides and

23
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,059
fungicides and that's true for all

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,980
berries and all fruits you definitely

25
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,719
need to wash your fruits and vegetables

26
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,640
before you consume them how do you wash

27
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,079
them vinegar plus baking soda seems to

28
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,180
do the trick soak for a couple minutes

29
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,620
and then you're just scrub them with

30
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,300
your own hands and then you're ready to

31
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,039
go Gokul Vijay asks are there any

32
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,960
alternatives to telephone well certainly

33
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,940
there are so Taliban is the best thing

34
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,559
for your skin 100 and the brand that I

35
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,879
trust and use is vintage tradition

36
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,140
because I literally know the guy who

37
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
produces this stuff I'll put a discount

38
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
code in the description if you want to

39
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,820
use it but as for Alternatives what

40
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
you're looking for is a

41
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,220
non-petroleum-based product and the good

42
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,960
thing is more and more such products are

43
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,600
coming out onto the market every single

44
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,880
day mark my words so this movement of

45
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,580
esoteric health is far broader than this

46
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,140
channel it's happening at a societal

47
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,119
level many businesses are propping up

48
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,979
non-toxic alternatives to traditional

49
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,420
products if you're an entrepreneur or a

50
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,960
businessman or if you want to get into

51
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,340
that I I'm telling you non-toxic items I

52
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
would strongly recommend creating a

53
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,400
product in that area and then promoting

54
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,960
it that's the field which is going to

55
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,820
grow in the next 10 to 15 years lack

56
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,220
places us are we supposed to be hanging

57
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,020
on Vines and branches because we evolve

58
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,600
to do so we're not exactly we evolve

59
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,939
from great apes and those also walked on

60
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,680
two legs so you don't need to hang from

61
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,560
branches because that's what we want to

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,659
do but you should hang on your pull-up

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
bar or a branch or whatever it is a few

64
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,380
times or at least one time per day

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,899
because of the spinal decompression

66
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,420
benefits best time to do it before you

67
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,920
sleep the brain detoxes itself only at

68
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,020
night and it can only do so when it

69
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,819
purchases toxins into the spinal fluid

70
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,560
so it's very important to decompress

71
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,120
your spine or at least alleviate

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,099
pressure on the spine so that your brain

73
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,300
can actually detox Sam gaming asks I

74
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,040
have yellow teeth how do I make them

75
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,620
white well you need to use a tooth

76
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,420
powder the one I've been using is one by

77
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,220
a company called van man and they've

78
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,780
come up with this hydroxyapatite tooth

79
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,980
powder which is really quite good and

80
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
they also have deodorant so a lot of

81
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,739
people ask me what kind of deodorant

82
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,300
should you use most deodorants are toxic

83
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,379
but a van man has come up with this

84
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,000
deodorant I believe it's a

85
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,560
magnesium-based product it's pretty good

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
actually I've used it myself and I can

87
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,879
watch for it username bot asks

88
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,860
recommended books well interestingly

89
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
enough fiction is actually really quite

90
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,040
useful so a lot of people in the

91
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,540
self-improvement type Community we just

92
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,420
talk about self-improvement books that's

93
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,400
a mistake there's spectacular learnings

94
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,379
to be learned from fiction for example

95
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,120
how do you learn to get good at making

96
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,160
friends and influencing people most

97
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,720
people would say read that book by the

98
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
same exact name right and other people

99
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,280
would say read 48 Laws of Power that

100
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,200
gives you the real depth into human

101
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,300
nature I think both of those are wrong

102
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,519
better to read actually the Game of

103
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,900
Thrones series Game of Thrones shows you

104
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,819
the Dark Side of human nature and

105
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,680
manipulation but also shows you that

106
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,720
true friendship and kindness do actually

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,220
pay if you're smart enough to use those

108
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,360
properly it's gonna be a dumbass like

109
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,620
Ned stork then you're gonna get what's

110
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,239
coming to you I'm gonna have a

111
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,040
full-fledged book club in my country

112
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,720
club so if you're interested in that EJ

113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,060
Kraft kid asks are there any

114
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,459
alternatives to Cologne well cologne is

115
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,319
highly highly estrogenic so there's a

116
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,180
whole bunch of aromatic molecules in all

117
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,459
colognes which mess you up for example

118
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,319
Dior Savage which is a very common very

119
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,940
popular cologne it's most pretty good to

120
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,739
be honest but it contains literally

121
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,120
contains red forts listed in the

122
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,340
ingredients it contains Redford so

123
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,260
mainstream designer fragrances are a

124
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,120
complete no-go however there are natural

125
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,980
fragrances coming out so I saw this one

126
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,659
on my Instagram recently called Soul

127
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,040
scent it's actually pretty good I bought

128
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,140
it it was reasonably priced and it

129
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,760
smells pretty good no natural fragrance

130
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,620
is going to last as long as your

131
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,780
designer fragrances that's completely to

132
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,099
be expected so know that going in not

133
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,560
exactly a question but I want to shout

134
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,019
out no Goods no glory because he wrote a

135
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,180
whole ass essay on the Roman education

136
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,220
system and how it prepped young Roman

137
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,200
young Noble Romans to be psyop free

138
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,879
actually anti-scion they were genuinely

139
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,380
taught how to think and not what to

140
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,880
think like how we are in our school

141
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,100
systems and even college to be honest

142
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,780
you know that young Roman Nobles they

143
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,020
would their fathers would send them

144
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,020
abroad on actual missions even as young

145
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,340
as like 14 15 16 17. they might have a

146
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,320
bodyguard and everything with them but

147
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,960
the fact is they would entrust genuine

148
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,880
valuable missions to Young Romans so

149
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,800
that even at a young age they had a

150
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,540
sense of responsibility a sense of Duty

151
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,580
and a sense that they genuinely matter

152
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,080
can you imagine how valuable that is for

153
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,479
a young man when your father literally

154
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,699
entrusts you with a mission off state to

155
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,500
go and perform we have no equivalent of

156
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,840
that in the modern world guys are like

157
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,820
21 22-23 and they're still basically

158
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,220
children but coming back to no goats no

159
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,139
glory so the fact is I've never seen

160
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,820
other channels commenters running a

161
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,220
whole essay and he's not the only one

162
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,139
many places I've seen people writing

163
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,000
whole essays and dissertations on my

164
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,060
videos and posts huge respect to those

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,400
guys another example Cornell gave me a

166
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,440
whole research essay on the education

167
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,300
system in the comments so I made a

168
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,100
community post talking about well you

169
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,600
know the education board was sponsored

170
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,979
by The Rockefellers and they designed it

171
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,660
in such a way that it mimics the

172
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,340
Prussian school system which is

173
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,680
literally designed to dump people down

174
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,600
and make them workers not thinkers and

175
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,340
Cornell went and fact checked me found

176
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
the relevant facts cited them and

177
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,880
actually wrote a whole essay in my post

178
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,740
my respect and gratitude I think the

179
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,720
viewer base watching this is genuinely

180
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,000
different from other places on YouTube

181
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,940
and I'll do my best to return that trust

182
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,500
Domino kiris asks what jobs have I

183
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,539
worked and what's a good nine to five

184
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,500
for a young man the best job I ever

185
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:53,100
worked was actually as a cashier in my

186
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,080
university school cafeteria the reason

187
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,639
is they were very chill I don't have to

188
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,259
like wear a uniform or anything so I

189
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,900
would wear literally a polo like this

190
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,580
one and I would be the door Checker so

191
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,160
I'll be the cashier in the front of the

192
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,620
cafeteria and what I do is I used to

193
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,660
have this speaker built into my collar

194
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,100
like under my collar and I'll have a

195
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,740
picture pop up and I used to listen to

196
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,419
audio books Incognito so the speaker

197
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,860
would be kind of invisible because it'd

198
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,199
be under my collar and I'd listen to

199
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,080
audiobooks as I do my shift and earn

200
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
money so I remember a summer was was two

201
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,620
months I finished something like 50

202
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,180
books in two months now be careful like

203
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,460
I'm not saying you should read 50 books

204
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,199
because what happens often is people

205
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,280
read books and don't take any action but

206
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,660
that was not the kind of books I was

207
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,979
reading anyway I was reading history and

208
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,780
philosophy so it wasn't exactly

209
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,979
actionable books so it just gave me a

210
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,259
lot of wisdom and knowledge which I

211
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,479
could use at a later date mythbot asked

212
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,060
can semen retention boost testosterone

213
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,500
well not directly so the direct effect

214
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,539
is actually on the dopamine circuitry

215
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,400
and I have a full guide coming out on

216
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,780
addiction so any kind of addiction you

217
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,180
can delete when you watch that video

218
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,340
samsara Indo asks about hair how do you

219
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,900
have good hair and why do homeless

220
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,039
people have such good hair I don't know

221
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,080
if homeless people actually have such

222
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,940
good hair and talks about how shampoo is

223
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,380
bad well shampoo is certainly bad most

224
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,080
shampoo is trash I've actually

225
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,880
experimented with using Tallow soap as a

226
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,440
shampoo so Tallow soap is what it sounds

227
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,940
like right it's soap with the main

228
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
ingredient is Tallow and I get it from

229
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,419
vintage tradition like all my towel

230
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,699
products I have this one Tello soap

231
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,500
which is mostly olive oil based and that

232
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,060
happens to be very good for hair so I

233
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,280
just use that for hair if you want to

234
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,080
know Atomic door asks me to make an

235
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,180
esoteric clothing guide well it's pretty

236
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,099
simple don't use synthetics use natural

237
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,380
fabrics and if you can help it don't

238
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,660
wear underwear done video is done I will

239
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,740
eat 100 apples ask what are your

240
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,740
thoughts on vaccines

241
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,840
Frank Vienna says how can I find a

242
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,240
community of like-minded individuals

243
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,500
like an esoteric Network well funny you

244
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,819
should say that he actually says it's a

245
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,740
business idea well it is certainly a

246
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,539
business idea the country club will

247
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,800
hopefully be available in the next two

248
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,240
weeks maybe at the time of watching you

249
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
only have Country Club available in

250
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,699
which case that's your esoteric

251
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,780
Community right there well I will

252
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,099
literally teach you everything I know

253
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,780
and this is a question I get all the

254
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,280
time in my DMs is supplements what kind

255
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,660
of supplements are good well I'll tell

256
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,039
you right now most supplements are kind

257
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,660
of trash most of the drugstore

258
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,880
supplements are trash especially even

259
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,680
even fish oil a lot of fish oil is kind

260
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,419
of trash and the reason for this is fish

261
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,099
oils are Omega-3s right that's what

262
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,319
you're looking for in fish oils mostly

263
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,720
those are highly unstable so if you heat

264
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,099
them too much in day nature so companies

265
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,259
which don't know how to store them

266
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,639
properly are giving you denatured oils

267
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,560
so are there some good Alternatives

268
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,780
certainly there are the most expensive

269
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
alternative is a company called Rosita

270
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,500
they make good stuff but it is expensive

271
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
another company is Nordic Naturals they

272
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,860
make fish oil I don't think they make

273
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,479
Cod liver oil which I prefer cod liver

274
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,520
oil because it has more vitamin D so

275
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,219
what do I use personally I use a product

276
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,660
by Green Pastures so Green Pastures

277
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,600
makes this very interesting product they

278
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,339
have a blend of butter oil and cod liver

279
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,080
oil they blend the two very unique

280
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,700
product definitely esoteric approved and

281
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,899
actually reach out to them and got a

282
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,440
discount code so if you want to use that

283
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,839
you could and last question by RC Slim

284
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,339
so I was just at the dentist and for the

285
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,959
first time in my life they did the teeth

286
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,480
cleaning and it didn't hurt like a

287
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,160
the hydroxy appetite actually works but

288
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,899
more importantly I'm going on a void to

289
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,060
the Old World on the 12th of this month

290
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,100
so I'm going to go to Venice Florence

291
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,399
and all the Italian states I'm going to

292
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,019
Portugal Spain France Italy and then

293
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,240
going to the south of Italy so I'm

294
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,560
following the path of Hannibal Barker

295
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,000
one of the famous generals of history

296
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,500
and every step of the way I'm going to

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,240
be sharing forbidden wisdom and showing

298
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,019
you these amazing cities on my Instagram

299
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,019
