1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,920
have you ever experienced brain fog your

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,160
brain is slow your thoughts are moving

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,360
through oil you are not having the

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,080
energy you're always feeling lazy it's

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,080
almost a pain to wake up in the morning

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
get a shower go outside get some

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,199
sunlight and actually do the work which

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,519
you are destined to do it feels like you

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,680
go into a room and you've already

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,720
forgotten why you went there you open up

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,119
a computer program you forgot why you

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,199
did it this is not normal it happens to

13
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,759
me I like clockwork every single winter

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,640
and I used to think it's some kind of

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,320
seasonal affect disorder it's not for a

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
lot of people depression seasonal affect

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
disorder all the stuff is just over

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,039
diagnosis so what's actually going on is

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,360
a metabolic syndrome rather than a

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,480
mental illness it's nothing more and

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,840
nothing less than a lack of energy in

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,719
the cells that make up your brain it's

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,160
not some kind of mental illness and you

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
shouldn't feel overly guilty for being

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,680
lazy is that you literally have less

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,640
energy because your mitochondria are

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,400
poisoned and how does your mitochondria

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,759
get poisoned it's because of these

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,799
filthy feed oils that these big

30
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,560
corporations with the support of the

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,720
government have pushed upon your parents

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,280
generation and your own generation

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
poisoning your blood stream right now so

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,880
what's going on exactly let's break it

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,479
down right it's mitochondrial health and

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,400
your mitochondria are broken and of

37
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,640
course you know what mitochondria is

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,880
everybody who's taken any kind of

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,720
biology will tell you mitochondria is

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,399
the PowerHouse of

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,439
and of course it is the energy center of

42
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,960
the cells which produces the energy

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,360
which literally fuels your entire body

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
including the Mind including the brain

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
so I'm going to give you the red white

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,799
and blue

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,159
protocol which is going to be a

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,399
metabolic reset going to give you

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,840
infinite energy to bring your Ambitions

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,520
to life the red white and blue protocol

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,159
is red light therapy white in the form

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
of creatine and blue as in methylene

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,640
blue so you might be thinking what the

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
hell does these three things have in

55
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
common you might have heard of red light

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
therapy it's something that you see on

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Tik Tok and stuff it's something you put

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,200
on your face to make your skin better

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,879
and you know what's creatine obviously

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,800
creatine monohydrate is the stuff which

61
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,560
you take to go to the gym helps you get

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,959
some last few reps in a little bit more

63
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,760
energy and of course creatine is like a

64
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,760
bodybuilding supplement right and then

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
methylene blue this is a more Uncommon

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
one you may not have heard of it but if

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,879
you're a follower of my channel you

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,040
already know what this stuff is it is a

69
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,840
cognition and mental energy type

70
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,360
supplement so you must be thinking like

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,319
what's bringing all these things

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
together and I'll give you some hints

73
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,560
the first is all of them are actually

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,840
good for skin including creatine so

75
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,319
topically applied creatine actually

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,120
causes skin to reverse age and same is

77
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,440
true of methin blue that also causes

78
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,120
reverse skin aging and red light therapy

79
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,480
is kind of that's what the purpose is so

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,000
of course it's good for skin and then

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,680
creatine is not just for energy it's not

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,959
just for the gym creatine is actually a

83
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,959
mental supplement as well it is a

84
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,680
anti-neurodegenerative supplement so

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
people take this to prevent neurod

86
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,040
degeneration literally creatine is first

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,760
and foremost a mental supplement even

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
before musculature and lastly we come to

89
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,120
methylene blue which is a well-known

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,920
antiparasitic antiviral but of course it

91
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,319
is first and foremost a mitochondrial

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,599
supplement so actually all three of

93
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,640
these are working on the mitochondria

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,959
they are not drugs they do not work on

95
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,879
any kind of receptors they work directly

96
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,480
on the mitochondrial function they have

97
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,599
very different Pathways and their

98
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,280
mechanism of action is very very

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,920
different from each other which means

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,200
that they have the synergistic effect

101
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,519
they don't interfere

102
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,760
with each other's Pathways they in fact

103
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,239
reinforce and reinvigorate the

104
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,920
mitochondria in completely different

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,519
ways that's why I've created this red

106
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,439
white and blue principle which brings

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
together different mechanisms of helping

108
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,640
the mitochondria so that you finally

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,599
have the energy Vitality Focus both

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,159
physical like you have raw Vitality but

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,680
also mental focus and Clarity to make

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,840
whatever Vision you have your destiny to

113
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,720
become manifest let's talk about these

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,239
one by one I will break down the actual

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,239
mechanisms of action I'm not going to

116
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,599
say that the so and so is good because I

117
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,439
think it's good I'm going to give you

118
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,959
the exact signs behind it and you can

119
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,319
make whatever determination you want

120
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,280
because this is of course not medical

121
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,959
advice this is my personal experience

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,440
and my own research first let's talk

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,519
about red light therapy this one is

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
something which a lot of people are very

125
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,959
skeptical about and that's fair enough

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,919
skepticism is a good thing but if you

127
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,479
look at the mechanism of action of red

128
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,880
light therapy it actually makes a lot of

129
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,080
sense so what's going on is mitochondria

130
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,120
has these five complexes if you've seen

131
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,720
my methylene blue video you know what

132
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,800
the five complexes are and you perhaps

133
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,720
from a previous bio class know that

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,360
complex 5 is really remarkable piece of

135
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,199
protein it's remarkable piece of

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,560
technology to be honest it's a turbine a

137
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,440
literal turbine so you know how a dam

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,520
works right a dam works by having a

139
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,720
large body of water kind of applying

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,479
pressure on this fan and it spins the

141
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,600
fan and that's connected to a generator

142
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,560
and you produce electricity that's what

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
happens in your cell in complex number

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,280
number five I'm speaking about

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,880
mitochondrial cells complex number five

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,840
literally has a turbine which spins

147
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,479
against the pressure of protons against

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,160
it and as it spins it has a little claw

149
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,240
which kind of cranks out these ATP

150
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,520
molecules which are energy molecules

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,400
literal packages of energy created by

152
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,840
this damn turbine brilliant I I couldn't

153
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,360
imagine like the beauty of this

154
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,319
little this invention this miracle like

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
it's it's a it's microscopic it's not

156
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,800
even microscopic it's literally a

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,160
molecule it's truly mindblowing truly

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,120
brilliant and it shows you the beauty of

159
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,199
nature the beauty of nature goes from

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,400
the smallest molecule to this massive

161
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,680
tree behind me but let's not get too

162
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,919
philosophical let's go back into the

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,960
science right so the this machine this

164
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,319
turbine functions better with red light

165
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,240
irradiation because it causes the water

166
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,000
around it to be less wiscus and that

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
means the turbine can spin faster and

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,680
that claw can attach more more ATP

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
molecules giving you more energy but

170
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,639
even that's not the only mechanism of

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,800
action for red light therapy in the

172
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,120
mitochondria complex number four which

173
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,319
is cytochrome C that's a completely

174
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,680
different kind of molecule it has a

175
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,120
different function altogether and

176
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,160
cytochrome C what it does it has this

177
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,360
claw and this claw can bind to nitrogen

178
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,120
well nitric oxide specifically or it can

179
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,240
bind to oxygen so what the red light

180
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,039
does is it knocks out the nitrogen from

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,759
the claw and it instead has to bind to

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,880
oxygen when it binds to oxygen you have

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
more energy from this thing called the

184
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,000
KB cycle which is what is producing ATP

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
in the first place so there you have it

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,160
that's two mechanisms where red light

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,800
directly influences the mitochondria to

188
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,759
produce more ATP and of course more ATP

189
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,319
means more energy overall you got to

190
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,720
remember there's more mitochondria in

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,160
the nerve cells than the muscle cells

192
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
you think of mitochondria we think of

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
energy we think of muscles but actually

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,639
20% of the calories which you eat it's

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
being used for the brain it's used for

196
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,319
mental capacity is used for thinking

197
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,160
it's for thoughts it's for the

198
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,319
subconscious to function not for the

199
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,960
muscles 20% for one single organ which

200
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,639
is roughly the shape of or the size of a

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,479
a football while the rest 80% is for the

202
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,680
rest of your body so a lot of energy

203
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,319
goes to your brain and the efficiency of

204
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
the energy utilization depends on the

205
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,080
health of the mitochondria which is why

206
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,199
we bring up the red white and blue

207
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,479
principle so we talk about about red

208
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,960
which is red light therapy and I will

209
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,599
say that red light therapy you cannot

210
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,800
just get any kind of lamp any kind of

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,879
product because a lot of the products

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,440
are I will link in the description

213
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,879
to the one which I have used I think

214
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,639
it's a really good brand and the reason

215
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,280
I think this is because they've taken a

216
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,639
lot of care in the engineering of this

217
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,000
product and of course as a past engineer

218
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,720
I really appreciate this they know that

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,960
non-native emfs so non-native

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,560
electromagnetic frequencies are damaging

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,720
for the human body and knowing this they

222
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,280
custom designed their fans to have less

223
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,400
magnetic radiation they also custom

224
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,680
designed a faraday cage around their

225
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,199
housing of the actual lights so that the

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,879
EMF exposure is very limited it's

227
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,360
basically zero and when a company takes

228
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,599
so much care of the fans and the housing

229
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm going to assume that their lights

230
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,000
are of high quality as well and you

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,919
might be asking well red light therapy

232
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,280
is quite expensive and it is it's from

233
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,919
$400 all the way to like thousands of

234
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,680
dollars and I don't want to prescribe

235
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,199
something which is outside the buying

236
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,879
power of most of my viewers doesn't make

237
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,879
sense for me to do that so I'll tell you

238
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,599
right now that you don't need red light

239
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,039
therapy devices in order to get red

240
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,519
light therapy you know what's a really

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,719
good source of red light it's the Sun so

242
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,719
you can get this in the morning you can

243
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,599
get this in the night so red light so we

244
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
usually associate blue light to be in

245
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,320
the morning right blue light wakes you

246
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,080
up gives you the circadium Rhythm reset

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,800
that's fine but the truth is there's

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,959
also red light coming from the Sun in

249
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,880
the morning as well as in the evening

250
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,920
times so the moral of the story is get

251
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,760
sunlight as much as you can every single

252
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,720
day I would go so far as to say that 1

253
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,959
hour minimum and here's the thing

254
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,560
there's something which just happened in

255
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
the morning modern world which prevents

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,440
us from getting the sunlight we supposed

257
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,920
to have in the winter month especially

258
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,959
we're spending practically 24 hours

259
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,120
within our indoors enclosure inside our

260
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,519
homes either in the office or college

261
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,800
and this is not how our ancestors lived

262
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,920
our ancestors even during winter months

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,279
would have to go out either to collect

264
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,279
firewood to fish to hunt to milk their

265
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,240
cattle whatever it was you would get

266
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,040
some sunlight even during the harshest

267
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,800
winter months except when there's an

268
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,279
actual blizzard going on

269
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,320
yes you would get some sunlight and

270
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,240
that's simply not something that we do

271
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,920
our modern habits we go to our office or

272
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,800
college and by the time we return back

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,079
home the sun's already gone down and

274
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,120
there's no more opportunity to get

275
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,160
sunlight so I would suggest if you

276
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
cannot afford a red light therapy device

277
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,360
just wake up in the morning get sunlight

278
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
as soon as you can or even during the

279
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,079
day it doesn't matter when just get some

280
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
sunlight but of course if you can afford

281
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,040
it then a red light therapy is a great

282
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,120
long-term investment Now we move on to

283
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
creatine and of course I know that you

284
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,279
you know what creatine is creatine is

285
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,600
the stuff you take to get your muscles

286
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,640
more jacked give you more reps in the

287
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,079
gym it's an energy supplement it's for

288
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,920
bodybuilders correct yes and no it is of

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,399
course great for muscle building and it

290
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,040
is a safe and healthy supplement to have

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,040
but there's actually even more research

292
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,120
suggesting it's amazing for the brain

293
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,880
health in fact creatine is used as an

294
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,360
anti- neuro

295
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,160
degeneration prescription it is not a

296
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,279
drug it doesn't bind to receptors it is

297
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,120
a mitochondrial supplement yet again but

298
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,839
the way the creatine works is completely

299
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
different from red light therapy so red

300
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,399
light therapy works on the complexes in

301
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,560
the mitochondrial Inner Cell Wall

302
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,279
creatine doesn't do that creatine

303
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,440
converts to phosphor creatine and the

304
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,000
phosphor creatine so okay I should

305
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,639
rewind a little bit so we talked about

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,200
how ATP is the energy unit of the cell

307
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:55,399
fine but when ATP is used up it becomes

308
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,160
something called ADP so ATP is adenosine

309
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:02,480
triphosphate so TR as in three ADP is is

310
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,000
adinos D phosphate which is d as in two

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,120
so when it loses a phosphate group it

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,720
becomes a less energetic state so

313
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,360
phosphor creatine can add an extra

314
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,360
phosphorus well actually a phosphate and

315
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
then you have an high energy ATP again

316
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,480
so it's a conversion mechanism from ADP

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
to ATP of course the actual biochemistry

318
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,839
is a little bit more complex than this

319
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,040
but it suffices to say that creatine is

320
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,760
a mitochondrial support supplement and

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,680
that's why it has these amazing

322
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,760
properties of regeneration for the brain

323
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,160
as useful for nerve cells as it is for

324
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,839
muscle cells and I'll go so far as to

325
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,480
say it's actually more helpful for nerve

326
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,440
cells than muscle cells because nerve

327
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,240
cells actually have a higher

328
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,440
concentration of mitochondria than the

329
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,519
actual muscles do so this combination of

330
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,800
red light therapy plus creatine is

331
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,519
already very powerful it's already

332
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
protective of the neurons in your brain

333
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,000
it's already firing up mitochondria in a

334
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,560
way that it wasn't doing before and then

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,160
you add in the third component of the

336
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,440
Red White and Blue protocol which is

337
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
methylene blue I did a whole video about

338
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,040
this but let's go into the just the

339
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,120
basics methyl blue is an auto reducing

340
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,880
agent which means that it can donate an

341
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,920
electron or accept an electron why it's

342
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,440
important is as the mitochondria is

343
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,839
cranking out more energy it's also

344
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,240
producing R reactive oxygen species

345
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,399
which are a waste byproduct which are

346
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
kind of toxic to the cells so this

347
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,240
methylene blue can actually neutralize

348
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,199
them by accepting an electron from them

349
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,199
and basically making them neutral and

350
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:30,120
non-harmful it can also donate an

351
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,240
electron to the components within the

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,040
electron transport chain in order to

353
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,519
have that functioning of glucose to

354
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,639
actual energy so this combination think

355
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,800
about what's going on here you have a

356
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,959
synergistic effect you have three

357
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,720
different mechanisms of action all of

358
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,560
which are not only protecting the

359
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
mitochondria from damage they're also

360
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
boosting up the mitochondrial function

361
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,920
they're also clearing out the waste

362
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,560
products of the mitochondria this unique

363
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,959
protocol I haven't really seen this

364
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,639
discussed elsewhere is a short-term

365
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,839
solution to be fair in the long term you

366
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,360
want to actually fix up your

367
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,040
mitochondrial Health through a better

368
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,880
diet better nutrition better lifestyle

369
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,480
in general but often times in order to

370
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,079
make long-term changes you need a

371
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,199
short-term win to make that happen

372
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,240
because what is long-term success

373
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,480
long-term success is a series of

374
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,120
short-term successes which build one

375
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,760
upon the other I believe that the red

376
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,680
white and blue protocol can be one small

377
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,880
success in that chain of Greater

378
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,839
successes until you reach your final

379
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Destiny so let's talk about dosages and

380
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,480
specific actionable steps so when it

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,880
comes to red light therapy I have done

382
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,600
20 minutes a day in 10 minute sessions

383
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,199
so morning wake up get 10 minutes of red

384
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,839
light therapy in at night 10 minutes of

385
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,000
the red light therapy and there's a

386
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,440
theory that it could boast testosterone

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,480
function and the idea is red light

388
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,160
therapy improves mitochondrial functions

389
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,279
of course the ladig cells which produce

390
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,399
testosterone in the balls they contain

391
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,199
mitochondria obviously and by boosting

392
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,279
mitochondrial function in theic cells

393
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
you actually can produce more

394
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,880
testosterone there's very limited data

395
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
on this so I cannot say that this is

396
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,920
something which is true but if you try

397
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,360
it and you feel better then there's a

398
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,399
likelihood that it's having some kind of

399
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,839
effect whether it's testosterone or not

400
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,440
you are going to feel better through red

401
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,880
light therapy regarding creatine 5 G of

402
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,360
creatine monohydrate per day that's a

403
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,040
standard dosage I have no

404
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,680
recommendations above that and then when

405
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,480
it comes to methylene blue it depends on

406
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,560
how much you react some people will have

407
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,000
a massive reaction to just one or two

408
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,120
drops of methylene blue and some people

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,480
like myself I need a whole dropper of

410
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,880
methylene blue in order to see the

411
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,160
effects and there's also the worry about

412
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,279
the side effects of methylene blue some

413
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,320
people have a higher level of anxiety

414
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,440
due to methylene blue I think it's

415
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,600
because methylene blue is so effective

416
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,560
at removing brain fog that when you

417
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,560
remove the brain fog you're face Toof

418
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
face with your anxious thoughts so if

419
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
that's the case for you I would suggest

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
of course fixing mental health issues

421
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
before getting on methylene blue now

422
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
mental health is a little bit different

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
so what I talked about today is actually

424
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,360
metabolic health I'm talking about

425
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,199
mitochondria and I'll of course make a

426
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,720
separate mental health guide when the

427
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,680
time is right and I have of course

428
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,920
suggested what brand of red light

429
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,320
therapy that I've used you may choose to

430
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,399
use that brand or if you have some

431
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,120
better suggestion put it in the comments

432
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,600
when it comes to creatine go for any

433
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
brand doesn't really matter I personally

434
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,120
just go for the Optimum Nutrition brand

435
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
just make sure that the ingredients list

436
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,720
has nothing but creatin monohydrate if

437
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,480
it has any kind of fillers any kind of

438
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,079
stabilizers that's not the correct brand

439
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
to go for and then lastly the Metaline

440
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,759
blue there's only one brand that I've

441
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
used and the only brand that I trust

442
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,480
because you really want to get the

443
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,440
pharmaceutical grade Metaline blue if

444
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,199
you get the industrial grade like from

445
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,639
some random brand on Amazon that's going

446
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,240
to do you far more harm than good so the

447
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,920
brand which I use I'll link it in the

448
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,720
description and there you have it boys

449
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,519
that is the red white and blue protocol

450
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
if you want the show notes for this

451
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,040
video there is an email intake form in

452
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,680

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,680
day-to-day basis I'll put it on

462
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,279
