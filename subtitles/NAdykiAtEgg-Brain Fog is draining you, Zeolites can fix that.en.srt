1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
For more than six months of my life, I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,040
ate lead, handled mysterious government

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,120
substances, and drank moldy water.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,040
Unsurprisingly, after this, I felt like

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
absolute dog [ __ ] I had the worst brain

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,719
fog imaginable. If it wasn't for

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
zeolytes, I would be still stuck in a

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,320
rut, and you wouldn't have this YouTube

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,400
channel. In Army basic training and the

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
infantry school, you're going to shoot a

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,840
lot of guns, and that means you're going

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,039
to come in contact with a lot of heavy

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,119
metals from the combustion dust from

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,120
using these rounds. You're also going to

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,079
use CLP to clean your rifle. CLP is

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,840
cleaner, lubricant, and protectant. It's

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
a liquid that you use to clean your

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,480
weapons and also just as a lubricant to

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
make sure your mechanism of the rifle

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,640
works correctly. The actual formula for

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,239
this is not published by the government,

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320
so we don't really know what's in there.

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
But a common hypothesis is that it's

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,360
liquidized Teflon. So, I was in contact

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,600
with liquidized Teflon and lead

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,199
practically every day. Worst part is

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
often times you'll go to the range,

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
you'll shoot all day, and then you'll

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
have your MREs. MREs are these packaged

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,080
meals, and there's no real place to wash

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
your hands or be hygienic. So often

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
times you'll go from shooting to

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,720
cleaning your rifle to eating. So I'm

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,640
sure I ate a bunch of lead and heavy

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
metals. On top of this, there was a

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
third enemy that I had to face. In basic

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
training and the AIT, you have this

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
thing called a camel back. It's like a

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
backpack that you wear which contains a

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,280
pouch which has water inside. It has a

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
hose through which you can drink the

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
water. So it gives your hands freedom to

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
you handle stuff but you can still get

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
water quite easily. That's why you're

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
always required to wear it. We had this

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,079
brilliant idea that we would take our

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
electrolyte packets from our MREs, dump

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,960
it into the pouch on our backs and then

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,960
get electrolyte water through our hose.

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
What happened we didn't realize was the

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
electrolytes had sugar in it. It's not a

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,399
problem in this case except for the fact

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
that it allowed mold to grow in that

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,280
hose that we drank from just on a whim.

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
I decided I was going to clean my camel

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
back. Most people never did this. So, I

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,239
took a pipe cleaner and shoved it into

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
the hose just to see how dirty it was.

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
When I took it out, it was just black,

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
completely black with mold. And I had

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800
been drinking water out of this hose for

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
months at that point. So to speak about

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
mold toxicity, I think I would I'm quite

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,160
of an expert in being toxified by mold.

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
Once I got done with all this, I had the

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,319
terrible brain fog that I mentioned. I

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
just could not focus. Also, my allergies

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
were absolutely flared up and I had all

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,720
these plans in basic training. I had

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
journal almost every single day and I

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
had this plan for the life that I wanted

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,879
to create for myself, but I could not

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
execute on it because my health was

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
holding me back. That's where zeelites

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
come in. When I learned about zeolytes,

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,200
I learned that they were a detox tool.

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,360
So, what did I do? I just went to

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
Amazon, bought the cheapest zeolytes,

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,879
and then started taking 2 g per day, 4 g

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,319
per day, 6 g per day. I was lading it

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,800
up, which is what you're supposed to do

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,360
with most supplements. But zeolytes are

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,920
not supplements. A dietary supplement

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
supplements your diet, but a zeolyte has

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,040
no nutritional value. It's not a

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
supplement. So the dosing structure

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,840
which I used which was the slow lading

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,319
up was completely misguided and caused

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,040
more problems than it solved. So I felt

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,879
even worse because of the zeolytes. In

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,280
this video I'm going to teach you why

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,159
that paradoxical dosing structure works

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,720
for zeolytes. What zeolytes are how they

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,040
work whether they're right for you and

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,280
what what should you look for in a

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
zeolyte product. And zeolytes are top of

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,599
mind for me because very recently,

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
couple weeks ago, I was traveling a lot

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,200
back and forth, 12-hour journeys, and in

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
the process, I probably ate something

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
bad. Cold meat from a Delhi in the in an

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,560
airport. Things like this happened, and

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,000
I just got terrible gut distress. Gut

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
distress is just a fancy word. What

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
really happened was I woke up in the

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,560
middle of the night feeling like

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,400
garbage. Went to the bathroom, not

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,040
thinking too much, and just absolutely

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,519
heaved into the into the toilet bowl,

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,680
just gripping on for dear life. Ah, it

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,680
was like it was actual projectile.

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Luckily, I made it to the bathroom, but

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,560
god, it was awful. I lost like 5 lbs in

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,720
a day and not in a good way. So, it was

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,439
not fun. Here's the thing. Usually, you

116
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,760
take days to recover from this. Days to

117
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,440
rehydrate, days to actually, you know,

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
for your body to fight the infection.

119
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,479
But what I did was I had zeolytes at my

120
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
home and I took a mega dose, 20 g one

121
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,080
time. And then the next day I felt

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
normal, like completely normal, like

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
nothing had happened the previous day.

124
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,759
And that just goes to show you how much

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,880
of a powerful detox tool zeolytes can

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,320
be. Now, if you haven't had the same

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
life experience as me, you're not

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
exposed to toxins in the same way as me,

129
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
but you are still exposed to toxins. If

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
you live in an older home, guaranteed

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
you're going to be exposed to lead

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,520
piping and lead paint. If you've eaten

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
at any restaurant ever, you're going to

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,600
be exposed to aluminium cookware, which

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
is what all restaurants use to cook

136
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,639
their food. Arsenic is in the

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,320
groundwater. So even if you have a well

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,440
in the middle of nowhere, quite a good

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
chance that there's arsenic in your

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
water unless you've tested it and made

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,560
sure that that's not the case.

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
Glyphosate is a common essentially a

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,800
herbicide used in agriculture seeps into

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
the ground water. It seeps into our

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
drinking water. If you eat fast food or

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
frozen foods, you're going to be exposed

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
to a lot of heavy metals toxicity.

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Canned food and fish are a source of

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,479
mercury. And then if you're using

150
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,400
nonaluminium free deodorants, you're for

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,919
sure being exposed to aluminium. And

152
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
finally, all these heavy metal

153
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,080
toxicities, they do have a way of

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080
interacting with your genetic material,

155
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
which means that you can pass on the

156
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
damage from these toxins to your future

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
generations. So, this is something we

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
certainly want to avoid. If you're

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,840
feeling fatigued, brain fogged, and just

160
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,360
tired all the time, and you can see that

161
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,160
he has these bags under his eyes. If

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,080
that's you, it's not what we want. So,

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
the first thing we talked about is the

164
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
heavy metal toxicity. But another

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
problem commonly faced is ammonia

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
buildup. So as you live and just having

167
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,680
natural chemical reactions in your body,

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,680
ammonia is produced and that's normal.

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
But if you have an ammonia buildup that

170
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,440
causes brain fog because ammonia can

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
actually travel through the bra blood

172
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
brain barrier and enter the brain and

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
disrupt well of course the brain

174
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
functioning. It specifically disrupts

175
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
GABA which is one of the key

176
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,720
neurotransmitters for sleep. So I'm

177
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
going to go ahead and draw some worry

178
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,880
lines. But ammonia also messes with

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,039
mitochondrial function. The mitochondria

180
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,039
produces ATP. Everybody knows

181
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,039
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the

182
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
cell. Produces ATP through something

183
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,400
called the Kreb cycle. Ammonia can

184
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
disrupt this cycle. So, I'm going to

185
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,880
give our Jack kind of an unhappy

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,039
expression and even some drool because

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
he's just brain fog. He's confused. He

188
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,840
cannot put his plans into action. On top

189
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,680
of this, if you get sick often or if you

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
have allergies, you also have a

191
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
histamine buildup. Histamine is a

192
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
byproduct of an allergic reaction. It's

193
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,400
just your immune system overreacting or

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,720
even normally reacting, you will produce

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,319
histamine. So, if you have allergies or

196
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,479
sickness, you have histamine buildup on

197
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,639
top of the heavy metal buildup. And I

198
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
should also put in the ammonia. And

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,280
how's your digestion? That's his

200
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,560
stomach. And as you can see, is just

201
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,919
bubbling up with all kinds of

202
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,479
indigestion. You have gut toxicity

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
issues. You have constipation. You can

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,479
also have diarrhea. On the other side,

205
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
this is not where we want to be. Also

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,400
want to draw some some flies cuz yeah,

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,160
bad gut health just results in bad

208
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
overall health outcomes across the

209
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,759
board. You are not going to be able to

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,520
succeed at your business, at your career

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
at being productive and focused and

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,919
actually making a step in life. If you

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
have gut toxicity or any of these other

214
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,599
buildups, now what's the dream outcome?

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
Where do we want to be? We want to have

216
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,599
a nose that's 100% functional. We want

217
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,280
to have eyes that are clear and free of

218
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,759
any kind of allergic reaction. We want

219
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
to have a deep and resonant voice with

220
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,440
which to communicate our ideas. We want

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,560
to have long luscious locks making us

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,080
look handsome. Want to have a big old

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,400
neck for our strength. Let me finish out

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
his other

225
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,199
eye. There we go. That's what we want to

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,560
be. We need a clear set of actionable

227
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
steps. And that is what I'm going to be

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
providing. I'm going to show you how

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
zeolytes work, how the dosage works, how

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
to find good products, and how to get

231
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
same day benefits. And all of this

232
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
completely unsponsored. I'm not making

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
any money by selling you any products.

234
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,400
How does toxin buildup even work? So

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:35,360
it's like this. Imagine this is your

236
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:38,800
body. B O D Y. You have toxin coming in.

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,880
You also have toxin leaving. Since your

238
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,440
body is pretty good at removing toxin.

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,240
Now the problem is if your level of

240
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,120
toxin intake exceeds the level at which

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,760
your body can remove toxin then you are

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,000
going to have a buildup of toxin with

243
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,200
time. So we can do one of two things. We

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,399
can either start to eliminate toxins

245
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,320
entering which is a certainly a good

246
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,440
idea. But in this video, we're speaking

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,320
of how to increase the outflow of toxin

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,360
using zeolytes. So if you do this, you

249
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,279
will reduce the level of toxin buildup.

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
This is what's called a stock and flow

251
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
diagram. This is a stock and these are

252
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
flows. This is just a basic introduction

253
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,320
to how system theory works. And I will

254
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
get much more into depth in other

255
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,360
videos. So why should you listen to me?

256
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
Well, I'll put the credibility stack in

257
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
the description where really my

258
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
experience comes from running Crusade

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
Labs, a functional health practice

260
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
designed to help men become the most

261
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,720
productive and focused versions of

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
themselves. And I accomplished this

263
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
using hormone optimized training. But to

264
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
be clear, I'm not a medical doctor and

265
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,120
this is not medical advice. So, let's

266
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,360
get started. So, what are zeolytes?

267
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,800
Zeolytes are volcanic ash. This is a

268
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,800
volcano spewing out ash. But the ash has

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,640
fallen into a lake. And this lake

270
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,120
contains

271
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,480
alkaline water. And if this is allowed

272
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,480
to react for 50,000

273
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,200
years, what you end up with is a

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,480
zeolyte. But why are zeolytes special?

275
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Zeolyte, zeo means steam and lithos

276
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
means rock. So a rock which has steam

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
inside. What does this mean? So the guy

278
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,240
who discovered it, what he did was he

279
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,399
heated the stone and in so doing he saw

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,480
that steam was released which is a very

281
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,519
strange phenomenon. Why this happens is

282
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,040
because the zeolyte itself has porous

283
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,680
structures. It has all these little

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
cavities in the structure which can trap

285
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,600
water. So upon heating this water is

286
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,440
released as steam. This is very

287
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
important because it's these cavities

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
that give zeelites their unique

289
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,880
properties. So different zeolytes have

290
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,200
different properties based on the shape,

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,120
size and charge of the pores in its

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
structure. Zeolytes are made of

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,160
aluminium, silica and magnesium. But it

294
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,320
traps mercury, arsenic, lead and

295
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,200
cadmium. And like I said before, it also

296
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
traps histamine. On top of this, it also

297
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,399
traps ammonia. So theoretically, if your

298
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
body has a reduced load of heavy metals,

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,040
histamines and ammonia, you're going to

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
solve your brain fog problem. And the

301
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
reason why it's able to attract these

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,040
heavy metals is because zeolyte has a

303
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,760
slight negative charge and these ions

304
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,079
are all positive charge and it's able to

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,320
trap them because of the cavities and

306
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,040
the pores. Now the thing is not all

307
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
positively charged ions are toxic. For

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
example, if you take a supplement like

309
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,320
if you take a electrolyte supplement

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
you're going to have sodium, you're

311
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,480
going to have magnesium, you're going to

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,399
have calcium, you're going to have

313
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,680
potassium. All these are positive ions

314
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,920
but they're they're good for you. their

315
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,160
electrolytes. In other words, zeolytes

316
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,640
selectively traps the bad stuff and

317
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,040
leaves the good stuff alone. It does

318
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,200
this because again, it's a selective

319
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
binder. And this is actually in contrast

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
to other binders like activated

321
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,839
charcoal. Activated charcoal will just

322
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
capture anything. Zeolytes are

323
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
interesting because of the selective

324
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
binding property that they have. In

325
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,880
fact, this is not a big secret. Farmers

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,959
know about this. Farmers feed zeolytes

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,680
to their cattle in order to protect them

328
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,399
from ammonia toxicity. A lot of farms

329
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,519
use ammonia to fertilize their grasses.

330
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,360
So if a cow or cattle eats grasses which

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
are ammonia based fertilizers in them,

332
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
then they're going to have ammonia

333
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
buildup in their bodies. Not good for

334
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,920
them. So they feed them with zeolytes in

335
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
order to eliminate the ammonia toxicity.

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
On the other side, chickens fed with

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
grains are exposed to aphotoxins. So

338
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
farmers feed them with zeolytes to

339
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,839
remove aphotoxins from their bodies. And

340
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,680
what's true for chickens and cattle is

341
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,399
also true for the human body. In fact,

342
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,240
most zeolytes are not used as a human

343
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
consumptive supplement. It's actually

344
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
more used in agriculture and in the

345
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,959
industry. It's a hugely beneficial

346
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,360
substance for chemical processing. In

347
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,440
fact, they literally use zeolytes to

348
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
clean up nuclear waste in a place like

349
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
Chernobyl. They literally use zeolytes

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
to clean up the nuclear spill. If you're

351
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,480
watching this, it's clear that you're

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,000
invested in improving your health. It's

353
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,160
clear that you want to fix your brain

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
fogs, gut issues, whatever else you

355
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,760
might be facing in order to live a

356
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
better life. If this is you, your first

357
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,680
step in fixing your health has to be

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,519
getting your blood work done. Getting

359
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,440
blood work done provides you the road

360
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,120
map on what you need to do next. But

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
getting blood work is a pain because

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,480
first, there's a million biomarkers to

363
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,079
choose from. It's not clear which ones

364
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
you need. And the second is once you get

365
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,839
your results back, it's hard to know

366
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,760
what the numbers actually mean. We will

367
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,600
actually help you to solve this for

368
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
free. Me and my team are certified in

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,279
functional blood chemistry analysis. If

370
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
you fill out the form below, we will be

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
able to help you. And now we're going to

372
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,880
move into the tactical side of how you

373
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:38,240
should actually use the zeolytes. So

374
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,160
here's a graph of dosage versus time.

375
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
Most supplements, especially supplements

376
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
which you're not sure of, supplements

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,839
that are new to you, you'd want to start

378
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,240
out small, see how your body tolerates

379
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,240
it, and then go to a healthy stasis

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
amount and then maintain that. With the

381
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
zeolytes, it's quite the opposite. So

382
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
this I'm going to rate as normal subs.

383
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
So this could be something like

384
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,360
creatine. This could be something even

385
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,000
more exotic like metaline blue. But

386
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,440
that's how you should treat most

387
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,160
supplements. But with zeolytes, it's

388
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
actually like

389
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,560
this. And the reason for this is because

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,399
zeolytes work using a swap and drop

391
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
mechanism. And I'll explain that using

392
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,639
an analogy. Imagine you're living in a

393
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
home and you notice there's a bunch of

394
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,800
mercury vials in your basement. You're

395
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,160
like, I don't want these toxins in my

396
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,839
house. I'm going to take them outside.

397
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
So, you go down to your basement, grab

398
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,800
this mercury, and you're on the way out

399
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,440
to the exit to dispose of this. But on

400
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,519
the way, you just see a pile of lead on

401
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
the floor. Like, okay, that's higher

402
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
priority. And you you look at that and

403
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
then you just drop the mercury, grab the

404
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,279
lead, and take it out the exit. Now,

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
taking the lead out the exit is the

406
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,720
correct move. But in the process, you've

407
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,040
dropped this mercury and spilled it

408
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,440
across your floor. That's kind of how

409
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
zeolytes work. They just have shiny

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
object syndrome. If they see something

411
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,199
of higher priority, they will drop the

412
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
thing which they're carrying and pick up

413
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,920
the higher priority molecule. This is

414
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,600
not good because you don't want to drop

415
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,959
the mercury on the floor. It would have

416
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
been better if the mercury was just

417
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,680
safely sequestered in the basement. And

418
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,160
so it is with your body. So what does

419
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,040
the good look like? Good looks like it's

420
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,560
just not you. You and you have a team of

421
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,240
five buddies who are right behind you.

422
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,000
So that if you drew drop the mercury,

423
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,440
they pick that up and you can pick up

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
the lead and take it outside. Basically,

425
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
what I'm saying is a small dose of

426
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,839
zeolyte will actually do more harm than

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,040
good because you're accidentally taking

428
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,040
out the toxins from from storage and

429
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,360
just releasing them into the body. Not

430
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,240
good. What you need is a big army of

431
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,399
zeolytes ready to capture all the toxins

432
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
and take it all out on the same day.

433
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,240
Which is why you want to start with high

434
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,760
dosage and go with low dosage. Now

435
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
again, I want to make the disclaimer

436
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,680
that I'm not doctor and this is not

437
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,440
medical advice. Use your own research.

438
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,600
And how do I know this? I know this

439
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
because I made the same mistake. As soon

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,839
as I got out of the army, I tried the

441
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
zeolytes, but I did this supplementation

442
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,199
regime instead of how you're supposed to

443
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,519
do it for zeolytes. So, in terms of

444
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,959
exact numbers, what I would do right now

445
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,560
is 10 g of zeolyte every day for 7 days.

446
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,040
And how you use it is you take your

447
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,600
zeelite powder, put it into clean water

448
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,759
with a wooden spoon. This is important.

449
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
Stir it up and then drink it. So, 10 g

450
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
per day for 7 days is what I would do.

451
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
Now there are special cases for zeolite

452
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,680
use. For example, what I said is if you

453
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
fall sick. If you fall sick with an

454
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,440
infection, then you want to absolutely

455
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
nuke it. And I would go all the way up

456
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
to 20 g for a day. So how do I actually

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,560
use zeolyte? I don't consume zeolyte

458
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
year round. I use it on a need basis.

459
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
When I feel more brain fog, when I feel

460
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,759
an infection coming on, or when I've

461
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,279
recovered from an infection, I will

462
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,959
absolutely use zeolyte. But it's not

463
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,839
something I use day by day. Now I'm

464
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,680
going to move to product

465
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
recommendations. Before I do that, I

466
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,680
want to just say that you can have

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,360
zeolytes any time of day. Before or

468
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,560
after food, it doesn't matter. It works

469
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
the same. When you're looking for a

470
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,440
product, you're looking specifically for

471
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
cleanup tillite zeolyte. That's the only

472
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
kind of zeolyte which is acceptable for

473
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,480
human consumption. You want to look for

474
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
third party testing to make sure that

475
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
they are free of impurities. Then you

476
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
want to look for the ratio of silica to

477
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
aluminium in the structure of the

478
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
zeolyte. You want at least 70%,

479
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,679
preferably more. And finally, there are

480
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,240
liquid zeolytes in the market. I reject

481
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,400
these. These just don't have enough of

482
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
the actual zeolyte to be effective. The

483
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,799
powder form is far better. And then

484
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
there's micronized versus mil. You're

485
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
always looking for micronized zeolyte

486
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,839
over mil because when you have mil

487
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
zeolyte, this is mostly for industrial

488
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,760
purposes. This will shatter the

489
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,520
cage-like structures in the zeolyte.

490
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,440
Micronized will keep those intact. And

491
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
there you have it, a full rundown on how

492
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
to use zeolytes. But even so, the first

493
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,440
step in health is still getting blood

494
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
work done. And like I said before, we

495
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,559
can help you with that. Just use the

496
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
link in the description. And

497
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,880
specifically, if you have histamines, if

498
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,799
you have allergy problems going on right

499
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
now, the previous video I made is

500
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,760
specifically about that. It's going to

501
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,360
help you. It's going to change your life

502
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,640
if you have allergies. I want to leave

503
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,679
you with a reminder. Being healthy in a

504
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,080
sick society gives you an unfair

505
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,080
advantage.
