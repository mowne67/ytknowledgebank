1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,879
every video game has a skill tree that's

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,480
because they want you to know how to

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,080
progress through the game and actually

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,200
get better and have a visual

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,040
representation for how you have

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
progressed through the game you usually

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,679
start off the game having no skills no

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,080
points no experience but as you go up

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,119
and you reach the late game you become a

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,480
force of nature so I've always wondered

11
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,080
what a skill tree for real life would be

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,640
and what I'm going to show you right now

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,640
is the skill tree which I've been using

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,679
since 2018 this skill tree is going to

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,119
contain nine metrics and these nine

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,000
metrics are going to allow you to do two

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,399
things first it's going to show you a

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,480
snapshot of your life as it is right now

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,079
and with it you're going to be able to

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
create a high resolution image of your

21
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,239
life in one year and 10 years time so

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,600
you actually have a destination that you

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,120
can have a direct plan towards so this

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,079
is the tool that you're going to use to

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,079
create your one-ear plan and does it

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,440
work absolutely it works I've been using

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,160
it since 2018 gives me a high resolution

28
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,280
image of what I achieved in the past

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,800
year and gives me a clear Focus as to

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,840
what to do the next coming year the way

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,000
the this works is there are three inner

32
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,759
vertices which are the core of this

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,759
framework and the very first one is of

34
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,479
course Health it's Fitness so I'm going

35
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,479
to go ahead and draw a dumbbell here to

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,000
symbolize Fitness there we go and what

37
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,119
do I mean by Fitness I don't necessarily

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,680
mean get jacked as possible I am talking

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,640
about vitality and vigor and energy in

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
life I'm talking about having the energy

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,600
and drive and mental resilience to push

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,479
through any obstacle and actually

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,240
achieve your goals I'm talking about a

44
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,200
baseline level of Health which goes

45
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,240
throughout your life I'm talking about

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,439
hormonal Health which is the basis for

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,600
strong physical body and also a clear

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,920
mind of course that is a topic onto

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,439
itself but that is really the first

50
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,960
metric which gives you access to the

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,560
second metric which is finances so often

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,520
time our first goal is to make money

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,479
this is backwards you need to First have

54
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,840
the mental bandwidth to think about how

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,159
to make money you need to have the

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
physical endurance to actually do the

57
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,479
work required to to make money so you

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
start off with Fitness and use that as a

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,160
resource towards building your wealth

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,280
and the second metric is the dollar sign

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,280
which is finances so basically your

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,879
Baseline for Fitness is can you see your

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,599
abs and do you have a score about 500

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,879
and the Baseline score for finances is

65
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,200
if you're making $110,000 per month

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
that's your Baseline if you want to

67
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,959
achieve more than that awesome if you

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,959
have this and this dialed in then you

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,959
have unlocked the New Frontier which is

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
freedom with a baseline of health and a

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,200
baseline of finances you know have

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,680
access to Freedom I'm going to try to

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,319
draw an eagle here let's see how well

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,640
that comes out there we go Eagle as a

75
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,280
symbol of Freedom so let's recap a

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,800
little bit this is your tier one let me

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,720
actually write that down so tier one has

78
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,159
three components which is Fitness

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,720
finances and freedom and when I'm

80
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,040
speaking of Freedom I'm specifically

81
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,920
talking about time and geography Freedom

82
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,200
a reasonable ability to travel where you

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,440
want and a reasonable ability to work

84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,720
when you want and you'll notice that all

85
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,560
the comps of tier one are completely

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,760
depending on you you don't really need

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,799
anybody to give you permission or give

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,440
you even help you can achieve all these

89
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,640
by yourself you'll have all the

90
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,480
resources available online to learn how

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,680
to do any of these things you can refer

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
to my earlier videos on how to have the

93
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,080
perfect nutrition I even have a

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,640
nutrition course at this point but once

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
you've done that then you start making

96
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,840
money when you have freedom and when you

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,840
have finances you are able to serve your

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,599
family this could be your parents or it

99
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,360
could be your kids if you have any so

100
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,200
with freedom of time and with actual

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,159
financials you can serve your family

102
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,959
they put down the symbol for family just

103
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,720
a cute little genealogy chart so you see

104
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,439
how this is like a skill tree right you

105
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,040
unlock Fitness that allows you to unlock

106
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,040
finances you unlock finances that allows

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
you to unlock loock Freedom when you

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,560
unlock freedom and when you unlock

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,720
finances you have the ability to unlock

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,439
family and when you have Fitness and

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,760
when you have freedom that's when you

112
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,400
are going to make your best friends at

113
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,919
this point you have the ability to build

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,400
a fraternity A brotherhood so with

115
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,280
freedom and fitness you'll have the

116
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,479
respect of others you'll have the

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,960
respect of men just like you and with

118
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,600
that respect you build fraternity I'm

119
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,880
going to try to draw a handshake if I

120
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,880
can and that is our second tier 2 metric

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,400
so tier two we have family fraternity

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,320
and the third one when you have a degree

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,960
of fitness and a degree of finances you

124
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,720
are now attractive to females for the

125
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,280
first time you can unlock the feminine

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,680
so you have now access to a new skill or

127
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,720
new metric of embracing the feminine

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,880
aspects of life that means it could be a

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,520
wife it could be a girlfriend not sure

130
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
what that is for you but it's only after

131
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,039
you unlock these two that this tier

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
really becomes accessible but you see

133
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,199
this is still incomplete there is

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,680
another tier which is missing from this

135
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,560
a tier that's grander and greater than

136
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,400
anything on the diagram so far this is

137
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,199
tier three and you'll notice that in

138
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
tier two you're depending on other

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,160
people family requires interaction with

140
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,039
other people fraternity requires

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,759
interaction with other men the feminine

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,080
requires interaction with women whereas

143
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,960
tier one was mostly just yourself tier

144
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,240
three is interesting back cuz it

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,080
involves others but truly it's a inwards

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,880
journey let's start off with finances so

147
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,440
finances when you upgrade this to tier

148
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,360
three looks like this it is the

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,360
foundation it is the Legacy that you

150
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,840
leave behind this is beyond just making

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,720
money this is the thing which you leave

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,160
behind when you die this is the thing

153
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,840
that you'll be remembered for this is

154
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,880
the foundation you will create create

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,319
something you'll create something that

156
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,960
endures past your life this could be a

157
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,479
work of art it could be a book series

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,520
that you write it could be YouTube

159
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,360
videos for all I know it could be a

160
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,840
business it could be a physical

161
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,560
structure this is a thing which gives

162
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,880
you immortality this is the foundation

163
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,199
this is the tier three this is above

164
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,919
just making money and the same way you

165
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,919
can level up your game with Fitness so

166
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,800
Fitness is basically having a high level

167
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,319
of testosterone a high level of Fitness

168
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
you have end you have muscle cool but

169
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,080
there's a level above that and it's

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,759
called flow when you are doing a

171
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,840
physical activity which requires your

172
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,800
100% concentration and it requires a

173
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,199
level of skill that you are at the

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,759
periphery of your ability that is to say

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,639
like if you're playing tennis and you're

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,720
playing with a guy who's just slightly

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,800
better than you if you really push

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
yourself and you can match his Pace you

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,280
are in a flow State and Flow State

180
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
doesn't have to be physical Flow State

181
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,520
could be artistic for example a writer

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,039
who's really writing an essay which is

183
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,919
very difficult for him at the edge of

184
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,520
his ability to communicate that could

185
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,000
leave him in a flow state if you're a

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,280
public speaker and you're giving a

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,720
speech about a difficult topic you're

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,120
trying to communicate a complex idea you

189
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,080
could be in a flow state so flow state

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,759
is basically your physicality but it's

191
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,280
accelerated to the highest possible

192
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,919
level so your flow state is when you're

193
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,400
pushing your ability so hard that

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,240
there's a real risk of failure and to do

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
this you need to get really good so this

196
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
is not just your Baseline anymore this

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,240
is when you are truly building a art

198
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,199
form out of your body this is flow I'm

199
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,759
not sure how to draw a wave I'll try

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,120
okay that's my best approximation of a

201
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,639
wave looks like garbage I know but hey

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
the best I can do at this point and that

203
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,159
is your upgraded form your upgraded tier

204
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,039
of fitness and the same way you can

205
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,759
upgrade your freedom as well what you're

206
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,879
going to realize is even though you've

207
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,159
achieved so much there's still going to

208
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
be an inner layer of fulfillment you

209
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,000
still need to achieve so we complete

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,039
this the second item in tier three is

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,879
flow and the third is fulfillment that's

212
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,520
what you get when you upgrade Freedom

213
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm going to draw myself meditating and

214
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,199
the thing here is I have not achieved

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
this right I don't really know how this

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
feels like but I but I've had glimpses

217
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
of it when you're truly satisfied with

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,520
your accomplishments in life that's when

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
you have a feeling of true fulfillment

220
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,240
and that is your tier three so this is

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,400
tier one the inner triangle tier two is

222
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,560
one step accelerated and tier 3 is even

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,120
more broad even more deep now the

224
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,279
question is how do you use all this

225
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,479
framework to create your actual one-year

226
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,039
plan and the answer is you will create

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,080
yourself a table and on the table you're

228
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,959
going to have the current state and

229
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,959
you're going to have your desired state

230
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm going to use these as prompts to

231
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,279
write about your current and desired

232
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,560
state so you'll go ahead and start with

233
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,880
tier one your Fitness financials and

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,440
freedom write down your current state of

235
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,360
Fitness so for me I'm about 1 70 fairly

236
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,040
lean that's going to be my current state

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,079
my desired state so I'm going to write

238
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,640
my current state I'm going to write my

239
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,440
desired State my desired State is1 180

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,560
at the same level of leanness so that's

241
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,839
my desired goal at the end of the year

242
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,959
regarding finances my current state is

243
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,839
10K per month my desired state is 30k

244
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,480
per month regarding freedom I actually

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,959
very happy with my progress over the

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,279
year so you can also use this to assay

247
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
your past Year's performance over the

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,600
past year I've built out this YouTube

249
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,440
channel I've built courses I've built a

250
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,040
community and to achieve full-time

251
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,760
status on YouTube in a year that's a big

252
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,800
achievement in my opinion so I'm very

253
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,079
happy with my progress towards Freedom

254
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
so I'm going to write my current state

255
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,000
of Freedom how much freedom I have right

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
now and then my desired state in the

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,680
same way I'm going to go to tier two

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,600
right now my family I don't really

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,959
support them as much as I could the

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,920
desired state is I've retired my parents

261
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,880
so that's my desired state for family

262
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,839
regarding fortunity over the past year I

263
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,480
created a private Community a paid

264
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
private Community called the Country

265
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,680
Club and that gives me a sense of

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
fraternity with my like-minded peers

267
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,640
however I want to take this to the next

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,079
level I want to do in-person events with

269
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,959
them so that would be my current state

270
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,680
is KCC as it is and my desired state is

271
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,920
to incorporate Live Events and right now

272
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,600
that's all the metrics that I'm going to

273
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,079
focus on for the next 6 months I'm going

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
to focus on just these I'm just going to

275
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,360
focus on Fitness finances freedom family

276
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,880
and fortunity once I'm comfortable in

277
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,920
those metrics then I will progress on to

278
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,600
embracing the feminine the foundations

279
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,480
of my legacy achieving the Flow State

280
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,480
and achieving fulfillment because like I

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,399
said this is a skill tree you cannot

282
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,360
focus on everything at the same time you

283
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,120
have to go Peace by peace and yet

284
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,000
there's actually one component which

285
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,880
I've purposely left out until this

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
moment because I only want to share this

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,200
with those who have stuck with the

288
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,519
entire video at this point the final

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,120
component is Faith and you can interpret

290
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,480
faith in the way that you want the way

291
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,920
that it works for you but at the

292
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,360
foundational level this is Faith in

293
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,920
oneself This Is Blind Faith blind faith

294
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
in your destiny that no matter what

295
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,720
happens that you have a destiny to

296
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,279
fulfill you don't need any signs you

297
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
don't need any justifications you don't

298
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,519
need logic you don't need reason this is

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
meant to be blind faith and that is at

300
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,360
the center of it all I'm going to draw a

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,920
crown to represent its importance this

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,800
is the most important tier and you can

303
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,440
start off your journey and you can

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,160
sustain your journey only once you have

305
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,800
a degree of faith in your success before

306
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,160
you achieve anything thing and there we

307
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,800
have it boys that is the skill tree that

308
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,279
is the

309
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,800
9f framework I can actually help you a

310
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,519
little bit more so regarding nutrition

311
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,519
and fitness specifically I'm going to

312
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,880
provide you the esoteric food pyramid

313
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,600
which really gives you an understanding

314
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,600
of what nutrition really looks like
