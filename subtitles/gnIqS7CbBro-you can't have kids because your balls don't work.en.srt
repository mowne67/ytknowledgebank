1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
if the human race was to go extinct

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,420
because of an alien invasion a super

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,300
volcano earthquake explosion an

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,580
incurable place an Intergalactic Civil

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,259
War at least that's kind of cool it's

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,179
not ideal but I'd be okay with it

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,100
because at least we went out fighting

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,900
and now imagine if mankind was to go out

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,660
because we literally couldn't reproduce

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,760
we couldn't do the one thing the one

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
thing that all of our ancestors managed

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,939
to do if the human race was to perish

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,980
just because we couldn't have kids

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,539
that's kind of pathetic you might think

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,679
the real problem is overpopulation

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,660
because that's what they want you to

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,180
think understand that the entire

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,120
propaganda against having children

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,640
is a psychological operation it's a

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,280
psyop the academics the elites and the

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,620
media think that humans are a curse on

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,239
nature they think we are a Cancer upon

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,100
this planet well the question becomes

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,020
what do you do with the cancer exactly

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
you might seek to kill it in one of many

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,920
ways you might seek to poison it and

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,780
make no mistake we are being poisoned

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,820
and let's look at the statement there's

29
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,440
too many people on this planet as Jordan

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,080
Peterson would say that's the most

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,180
implicitly genocidal statement you can

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,680
possibly make because what do you do

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,939
with a statement like that there's too

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,920
many people on the planet well what do

35
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,659
you do about that exactly do you

36
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,000
genocide them force them to have

37
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,680
abortions or perhaps you don't want to

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
get your hands dirty so you just shame

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,520
them into Oblivion you shame people into

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
not having kids you shame them into

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,900
living a life that's subpar because of

42
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,460
your false ideology it's more important

43
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,780
than ever now to understand what's in

44
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,100
our environment what's actually

45
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,080
poisoning Us and how to actually

46
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,820
mitigate these toxins I want you to

47
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,259
answer some questions why has sperm gone

48
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,180
Fallen by almost 50 percent actually

49
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
more than 50 percent in just 50 years

50
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,280
years why has the rate of miscarriage in

51
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,619
women almost doubled in the past 50 to

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,180
60 years why has the level of

53
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,920
testosterone in men fallen so

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,100
drastically over the past half decade

55
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,320
why has the age of puberty among women

56
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,180
kept decreasing that is to say girls are

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,280
hitting puberty earlier and earlier

58
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,740
every single year all this points

59
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,720
towards severe endocrine disruption in

60
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,180
our entire Society the clothes we wear

61
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,500
the food we eat the water we drink all

62
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,619
have been poisoned to one degree another

63
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,179
this is unacceptable to me hence this

64
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,500
channel the question then becomes can we

65
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,360
fix the Damage Done To Us well

66
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,800
absolutely yes we can fix the damage the

67
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,300
mainstream narrative is that in

68
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,099
developed Nations people are having less

69
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,260
and less kids because they choose not to

70
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,879
it's because women are more educated and

71
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,860
they rather work rather than have kids

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,360
that's the narrative that's been fed to

73
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,920
you they say that because of this

74
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,540
progress this amazing progress that

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,739
women don't want to have kids and this

76
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,840
is actually good for the environment

77
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,700
it's good for humankind I call [ __ ]

78
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
on their entire ideology what's

79
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,000
happening is a lot of people who want to

80
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,140
have kids are not able to because their

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,300
reproductive systems have been

82
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,519
systematically poisoned luckily for men

83
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,860
it's a little bit easier for us to fix

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,480
ourselves you see men produce sperm

85
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,980
throughout their entire lives almost so

86
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,620
if you take a man and you separate them

87
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,420
from all the toxins within a few months

88
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,220
despite firmative produces is going to

89
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,959
be healthy again however the truth for

90
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,580
women is a little bit more harsh which

91
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,260
means it's more important for women to

92
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,959
take care of themselves women are born

93
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,599
with a finite number of eggs which means

94
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
that when these eggs get damaged there's

95
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,959
no easy way to replace them while it is

96
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
more important for women to safeguard

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,660
their bodies against endocrine

98
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,220
disrupting chemicals it's also important

99
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,480
for men I don't want men to watch this

100
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,640
and think they're okay and they're

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
immune from the harm done by edcs that's

102
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,420
not the case all I'm saying is it's

103
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,980
easier for men to recover than it is for

104
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,800
women and think about it we have a

105
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,019
significant Advantage going into this

106
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,040
While most men and women have no idea

107
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,959
what's going on and they're getting

108
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,519
systematically poisoned you and me we're

109
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,620
working on ourselves we're working on

110
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,540
educating ourselves and safeguarding our

111
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,340
bodies from these toxins which means

112
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,379
that me and you are going to be some of

113
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,879
the most virile men on the face of the

114
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,840
Earth and if you're a woman watching

115
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
this you're going to be one of the most

116
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,560
hormonally balanced women out there

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
you're actively getting our hormonal

118
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,459
systems back online in 10 years Imagine

119
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,780
by the average men and women are going

120
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,879
to be and where you and I are going to

121
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,739
be another psyop is this whole men

122
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,540
versus women type of dynamic which

123
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,060
they're forced upon us this is not

124
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,120
organic this is not natural it is never

125
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,280
men versus women it was always men plus

126
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,200
women against the problem you know

127
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,879
there's this ancient Greek myth the

128
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,459
Greeks thought that the gods created

129
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,159
humans as a conglomerate as man and

130
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,500
woman in one body these beings these

131
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,659
proto-humans were so powerful that even

132
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,120
the gods were afraid of them so the gods

133
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,979
of Greece they split them into man and

134
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,600
woman so that they would be forever

135
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,580
powerless and they could never oppose

136
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
the gods very interesting very

137
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,660
interesting how that parallels to our

138
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,180
society today men and women are more

139
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,699
atomized than ever before separated they

140
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,820
distrust each other which makes both men

141
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,160
and women far easier to control by those

142
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,199
who see themselves as Gods the question

143
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
of course becomes are they poisoning us

144
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,020
intentionally or is it just some fluke

145
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,400
is it just because of corporate greed is

146
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,320
just because of a consequence of

147
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,639
industrialism and nobody actually knew

148
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,139
what the hell they were doing well of

149
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,419
course that's a possibility but the

150
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,400
truth is it doesn't really matter at the

151
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,620
micro level so in your level literally

152
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,360
what you can influence around you your

153
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,440
family and friends at some level it

154
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,960
doesn't matter if there's a huge

155
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,120
conspiracy or this is just the act of

156
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,040
the Invisible Hand of economy the

157
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,199
actionable steps remain the same then

158
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,940
that's Key Don't bind to ideas which

159
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,639
have no actionable steps that's

160
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,040
pointless focus on what you can do get

161
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,020
it done fix your own hormonal systems

162
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,280
help your friends and family and then

163
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,320
we'll discuss what we can do at a

164
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,479
societal level the situation is not as

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,820
hopeless as it seems you see nature

166
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,160
itself is on our side the universe wants

167
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,960
us to win if we spend the time to get

168
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,639
ourselves hormonally healthy and rid

169
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,860
ourselves of psychological operations

170
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,800
this is actually a problem that solves

171
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,780
itself literally evolution is on our

172
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
sides all those people who say it's bad

173
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,940
to have kids fine let them not have kids

174
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,759
let us who are invested in Tradition let

175
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,979
us who are pursuing virtue let us have

176
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,380
kids and our kids will be higher quality

177
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,320
than theirs our kids will be smarter

178
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,240
stronger wiser more intelligent and more

179
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,759
resilient than their kids we will

180
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,020
out-compete them at a genetic level so

181
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,240
we don't have to fight some kind of

182
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,220
ideological war when it comes to

183
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,100
psychological War we actually have the

184
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,539
upper hand time is on our side biology

185
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,520
is on our side

186
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,280
but when it comes to the chemical war

187
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,979
time is certainly not on our side we are

188
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,380
losing the chemical War get this there

189
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,300
is birth control in your water women who

190
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,160
consume birth control they peed out

191
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,479
those molecules are not destroyed those

192
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,580
molecules find themselves in the water

193
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,139
filtration plants which recycle the

194
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,780
water send it right back to your homes

195
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,419
then we consume literal birth control

196
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,940
molecules birth control is obviously a

197
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,620
hormonal inhibitor women who are on

198
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,479
birth control have the same menstrual

199
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,520
cycle as a woman who is pregnant now

200
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,979
think about this very carefully young

201
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,500
girls are being prescribed birth control

202
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,120
before they even hit puberty just so

203
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,380
that they can clear up their acne on

204
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,360
their face if you know anything about

205
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,039
young girls and even young boys they'll

206
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,139
do anything for appearance sake right

207
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,940
they'll do anything to not appear

208
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,680
blemished and ugly in high school high

209
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,000
school is freaking brutal it's it's

210
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,160
completely understandable the young

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,780
girls would accept putting birth control

212
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,639
into their bodies in order to remove

213
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,319
acne they don't know any better they're

214
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,000
young and their parents have been told

215
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,800
that it's healthy by the fraudulent

216
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,840
doctor prescribe this stuff it's

217
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
actually FDA approved to use birth

218
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,400
control as an acne prevention system

219
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,500
which is insane instead of using natural

220
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,960
ways to clear your skin they're asking

221
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,520
you to take birth control Instead This

222
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,740
should be criminal and yet it's

223
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,660
completely normalized and even later in

224
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,440
life a woman who's taking birth control

225
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,300
actually has her taste in men altered so

226
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,180
women who is on birth control right get

227
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,340
this women who are on birth control

228
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,900
prefer more feminine men in fact it's

229
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,699
even worse than that women on birth

230
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,740
control actually prefer men who kind of

231
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,940
look like their siblings most women who

232
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,099
are on birth control don't even know

233
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,139
this is happening no surprise then that

234
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,479
women who come off birth control in

235
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,319
order to have a child with their husband

236
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,300
realize their husbands are actually

237
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,400
dweebs and choose to leave them this

238
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,699
kind of mass medication and mass

239
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,460
altering of biological imperatives is

240
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,199
evil and yet that is the norm men and

241
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,240
women of virtue are not to be split

242
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,620
about by meaningless psychological

243
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,500
operations rather they should come

244
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,300
together and create a bulwark create a

245
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,860
wall behind which to raise powerful

246
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,840
children these children will be better

247
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,819
than us in every way they will be

248
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,800
hormonally intact and they'll be

249
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,360
psychologically resistant this is what

250
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,360
they fear and for good reason
