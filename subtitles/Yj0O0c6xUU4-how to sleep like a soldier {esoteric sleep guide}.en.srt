1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
some of the best sleep I ever had was

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,259
curled up in a trash bag in the nasty

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,139
swampy Woods of Fort Benning Georgia

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,120
using the top secret U.S military

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,799
discovered and perfected sleep

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,719
techniques which I'm going to share with

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,660
you today but before that the first

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,880
thing is your bed is both estrogenic and

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,279
carcinogenic why do they think they have

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,740
a label on them which says air out for

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,080
24 hours before you use that's right

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,660
your mattress is literally off-gassing

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,679
toxins that you are breathing in every

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,660
single night so you might think to

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,960
yourself well why is this it's because

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,120
50 years ago the mainstream wisdom was

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,680
that smoking was good for you so the

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,780
media propagated smoking the science

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,760
said smoking was good so of course

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,100
people were smoking preferably after sex

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,100
on their bed and when you have smoking

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,500
in bed very naturally you have a flame

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,420
Hazard like a fire hazard and of course

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,180
the mattress company started putting

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,739
flame retardants into them beds so that

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,960
they don't catch fire which makes sense

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,300
Until you realize that the flame

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,700
retardants they used were highly toxic

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,820
you were probably exposed to these

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,100
estrogenic and toxic substances as a

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,500
baby when your mother laid you down to

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,880
bed on a toxic mattress of course she

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
didn't know any better and then your

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,119
father probably purchased for you

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,580
teething toys you know the toys which

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,740
babies chew on they often contain high

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,420
levels of BPA and when the companies

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,400
realize that there was bad press are on

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,759
BPA what do they do they switched out

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,700
the BPA for BPS and BPF which are

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,520
actually even more toxic than BPA ever

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,159
was so you were poisoned not just today

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,500
but as an infant hell even before you

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,820
were born in the womb you were poisoned

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,560
and then the scientists are trying to

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,840
figure out you know why are the sperm

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
counts going low why why is testosterone

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,500
falling and why so many kids are being

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,640
diagnosed with mental illnesses well

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,040
that's not the question the real

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,079
question is how we as a species are even

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,119
functional after we've been exposed to

53
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,939
so many toxins is basically chemical

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,479
warfare well the answer is humans and if

55
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,920
course nature in general is very

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,020
anti-fragile once you give nature or

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,179
humans a chance to recover we can

58
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,599
recover we can fix ourselves just

59
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,840
naturally and sleep is a key part of

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,040
this process sleep is when your body

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,500
detoxes and releases a lot of toxins

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,300
which builds up both from the brain and

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,520
the body I'm going to teach you the

64
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,020
exact way you optimize sleep including a

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
lot of tips which you've never heard of

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,220
because sleep is going to give you the

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,440
ultimate asymmetric Advantage because

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,879
sleep if you're young it's only actually

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
increase your height because you have

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,879
more human growth hormone if you're a

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,500
man it's going to increase your

72
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,020
testosterone make you more competitive

73
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,180
in the gym with women making money

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,440
everything if you're a woman it's even

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,720
more important for you because it helps

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,580
you regulate your cycle literally sleep

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,500
recharges your dopamine that's right

78
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,780
dopamine is not a toxin you should not

79
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,280
be doing a dopamine detox rather you

80
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,959
should be recharging dopamine and sleep

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,819
recharges dopamine the more dopamine you

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,980
have the more motivated you are and more

83
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,379
productivity you have per day it gives

84
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,379
you the ultimate unfair advantage in

85
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,720
life literally sleep affects the size of

86
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,340
your balls and the size of your dick if

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,780
that doesn't make you want to optimize

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,060
your sleep I don't know what's going to

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,220
do it for you book one the Sleep

90
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,319
environment the first thing is of course

91
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,060
your bed you need to have a non-toxic

92
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
bed I'm talking about a bed which is

93
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,379
completely made of organic substances

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
latex cotton wool your entire bed is

95
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,319
made of these and the funny thing is

96
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,940
when you make a bed out of these organic

97
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,800
substances it's almost naturally flame

98
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,420
retardant so you don't have to add

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,159
toxins in order to make a flame

100
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,540
retardant and the good thing is more and

101
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,220
more companies are coming out which are

102
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,780
making non-toxic products nowadays

103
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,760
you're able to find companies which

104
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,799
don't put toxins into their mattresses

105
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,360
now completely organic mattresses may be

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,040
outside your price range maybe you can

107
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,319
afford it in which case I had three

108
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,959
budget options first is the military

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,519
option a military cot it's a folding cut

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,620
which falls out doesn't have any toxins

111
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,879
in it and you can put a cotton liner on

112
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,620
top and then lay on top of the cotton

113
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,120
liner so your body is some completely

114
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,459
safe from any kind of toxin and the

115
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,620
second option is the samurai option it's

116
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,760
called a a tummy mat you can find these

117
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,500
things on Amazon you can find them in

118
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,480
many different sites it's basically a

119
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,680
Japanese strong mat and this is

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,480
literally what the samurai used

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,879
completely non-toxic safe to sleep on

122
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,400
highly recommend then we have the tribo

123
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,560
option this is just a simple straw mat

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,359
you just roll it out put a cotton liner

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,040
on top of it and there you go sleep on

126
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,900
the floor on that mat that's better for

127
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,000
you than these toxic mattresses are your

128
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,500
question now might be well these are too

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
uncomfortable to sleep on how do you

130
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,460
sleep on these things well I'll address

131
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,320
all those questions in the sleep posture

132
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,699
part of this guide but before we get

133
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,699
there what should you wear when you're

134
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,800
sleeping ideally nothing sleep naked

135
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,360
because your body is thermoregulations

136
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,860
which is a temperature regulation of

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
your body is very very important when

138
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,639
you sleep it's a huge role in whether

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
you get good quality sleep or not if you

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,180
sleep naked you're essentially ensuring

141
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,520
that your body has the ability to rid

142
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,960
itself with extra heat and get a better

143
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,060
quality sleep of course if you're not

144
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,580
able to sleep naked for some reason just

145
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,680
wear a cotton boxers cotton undershirt

146
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,600
something really light so it doesn't

147
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,020
impede your body's ability ability to

148
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,940
eject extra heat book two sleep posture

149
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,500
so what's the best way to sleep should

150
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,000
you sleep in your back your side your

151
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,979
belly don't sleep on your belly that's

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,440
the worst possible position you have two

153
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,960
options back or your side I prefer side

154
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,820
and here's the reason why all Apes sleep

155
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,139
on their side which shows that nature

156
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,780
has a preference for sleeping on its

157
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,520
side and also all pre-modern people so

158
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,740
literally like tribal people who have

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,020
not been influenced by modernity these

160
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,880
individuals sleep on their side why is

161
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,320
this the reason is the scientists have

162
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,300
found out that when you sleep in your

163
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,220
side the brain can actually detox itself

164
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,199
much better so the brain like the rest

165
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,639
of your body builds up toxins as you go

166
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,139
about the day but the difference is your

167
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,060
body can actually detox some of these

168
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,680
toxins into the bloodstream during the

169
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,600
day but the brain cannot do that the

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
brain can only detox during the night it

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,620
literally flushes the toxins into your

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,479
spinal fluid and the spinal fluid

173
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,340
carries these toxins to your body where

174
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,259
it gets purged it turns out that if

175
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,080
you're lying on your side it's actually

176
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,419
easier for the toxins to enter your

177
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,160
spinal fluid and get removed so humans

178
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,960
seem to have evolved to sleep on their

179
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
side so that this brain toxins are

180
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,479
removed more easily if you're going to

181
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,340
sleep on your side make sure you have a

182
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,660
pillow between your knees as you're

183
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,400
lying on your side the reason is it

184
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,259
opens up your hip angle a little bit

185
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,759
which is very important for better blood

186
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,919
flow and circulation also puts less

187
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,539
stress on your joints you're going to

188
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,580
figure it out by now that the spine

189
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,220
Integrity the Integrity of your spinal

190
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,440
column is very important for ensuring

191
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,460
that the brain becomes detoxified at the

192
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,919
end of this video I'll show you some

193
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,960
stretching practices to ensure that your

194
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,759
spine is ready to detox the brain I'm

195
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,020
literally a certified yoga instructor so

196
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,280
I know what I'm talking about another

197
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,680
thing when you're sleeping on your side

198
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,360
is your pillow probably never seen a

199
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,220
pillow like this why because its pillow

200
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
is height adjustable it's important

201
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,280
because when you're sleeping on your

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,780
side you don't want your neck to be kind

203
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,580
of like crane because it's going to hurt

204
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,259
your neck and also not going to allow

205
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,120
the blood flow required for the brain

206
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,979
detoxification so you need a pillow

207
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,080
which is about the same size of your

208
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,419
shoulder so that your neck remains

209
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,520
intact and is in line with your spine so

210
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,620
this pillow is called a buckwheat pillow

211
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,940
so it's another Japanese product it's

212
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,620
filled with something called buckwheat

213
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,840
so there's a zip on here which you can

214
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,039
actually open and you can take out some

215
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,960
of the buckwheat and put it in a

216
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,160
separate bag to reduce or increase the

217
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,479
height like if you had this bag it'll

218
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,220
obviously increase the height so why did

219
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,660
I choose this it's because I could have

220
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,100
chosen a foam pillow which I'm not going

221
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,500
to do because it's toxic I could have

222
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,240
chosen a cotton or down or wool kind of

223
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
pillow which is fine but it tends to

224
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,660
irritate my nose for some reason so

225
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,759
buckwheat is completely non-allergenic

226
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,139
so this is a good choice for those

227
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,539
people who have some kind of allergy to

228
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,860
Cotton wool down but regardless if

229
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,479
breathing at night is a problem for you

230
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,860
you need to watch my esoteric breathing

231
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,720
guide in which I break down different

232
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,039
ways to improve your breathing does this

233
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
mean you should never sleep on your back

234
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,340
actually no back is not bad so long as

235
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
you don't have any breathing issues if

236
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,560
you're sleeping in your back there's a

237
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,780
higher chance that you might be snoring

238
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,280
because of the throat being constricted

239
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,199
but if you don't have that issue then

240
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,180
back sleeping is not bad but make sure

241
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
that you have a pillow placed below your

242
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,240
knees again when you're sleeping on your

243
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
back so if this is you and you're

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
sleeping in your back you want a pillow

245
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,460
under your knees because it's going to

246
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,560
elevate your legs slightly and that also

247
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,300
helps you you purge your toxins better

248
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,400
so you have something called a lymphatic

249
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,199
system which is the toxin removal system

250
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,599
is going to work better if your feet are

251
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,819
slightly elevated and before I forget a

252
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,740
sleep mask or a sleep like iPad whatever

253
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,660
you want to call these things buy a silk

254
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,039
iPad which goes over your eyes and shuts

255
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,660
out the light very important for your

256
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,720
Sleep Quality make sure it's silk if you

257
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,979
can because two reasons one silk is very

258
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,900
good for your skin in the sense that

259
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,460
cotton might have some abrasive effect

260
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,660
but silk is actually pretty smooth so it

261
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,879
doesn't do anything to your skin and the

262
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,099
second reason is silk doesn't warm you

263
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,500
up so you are covering half your face

264
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,599
with the iPad obviously so you don't

265
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,940
want something which retains heat a lot

266
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,680
so cotton or wool iPads are not the best

267
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,360
option silk is the better option you

268
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,159
also should be using a silk pillowcase

269
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,839
or pillow cover why because again same

270
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,120
reasons you're going to be sleeping on

271
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,580
your side your face is in contact with

272
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,160
the silk for nine hours and you

273
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,720
certainly don't want an allergenic or

274
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,899
synthetic substance touching your face

275
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,839
for so long book three breathing sadly

276
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,760
the air we breed as humans to day is not

277
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,980
the air our ancestors used to breathe

278
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,320
you wouldn't need a HEPA filter if

279
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,000
you're in Ancient Rome or mohenjo daro

280
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,100
you only need a HEPA filter nowadays

281
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,620
because our air is hyper concentrated

282
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,660
with all kinds of pollutants pollen and

283
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,180
toxins so you need a HEPA filter in your

284
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,320
home to filter those out and mold mold

285
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,060
spores are pretty common in most

286
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,860
people's houses so that's another reason

287
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,660
people's nose get congested because it's

288
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,660
little mold going growing in your home

289
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,420
is a HEPA filter as you can see it has a

290
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,580
filter it has a fan so it's basically

291
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,080
sucking air through the sides purifying

292
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,880
it and then releasing it into my room

293
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
then you might want to consider having a

294
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,600
humidifier the air in your room is dry

295
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,920
this is going to help you moisturize

296
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
your nose and make sure that it's not

297
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,120
inflamed then this is a tip which my dad

298
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,160
gave me you can apply a single drop of

299
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
coconut oil in the inside of your nose

300
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,100
and this is going to prevent it from

301
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,899
drying out and prevent some inflammation

302
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,300
you're able to breathed better and get

303
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,220
better sleep and lastly tape over your

304
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,019
mouth right this is a common one just

305
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,339
apply a piece of medical tape over your

306
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,500
mouth so you're not mouth breathing this

307
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,300
is important not only for your sleep

308
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,680
quality but also for your facial

309
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,660
attractiveness like how symmetrical your

310
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,100
face is is dependent on how you breathe

311
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,420
so if you care about how you look which

312
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,180
everybody cares about how they look

313
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,880
consider having a piece of medical tape

314
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,980
over your mouth as you sleep book four

315
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,560
supplements first off melatonin is a

316
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,380
no-go melatonin is a psyop so first

317
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,000
thing all drugstore bought melatonin has

318
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,380
very poor quality control you have no

319
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,360
idea how much Melatonin is actually in

320
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,500
there second thing artificial melatonin

321
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,600
it's a melatonin you get in a bottle

322
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,760
that's going to interfere with your

323
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,560
actual natural melatonin production in

324
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,820
your pineal gland your pineal gland is

325
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,560
one of the most important parts of your

326
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,180
brain very delicate and important

327
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,100
structure in your brain produces

328
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,500
melatonin so I don't trust anything

329
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,019
which interferes with the function of

330
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,820
the pineal gland including fluoride in

331
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,440
our water if you want to know more about

332
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,060
that topic you should go to my fluoride

333
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,500
video one question you might have is

334
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,760
caffeine should you have caffeine does

335
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,380
it interfere with sleep well of course

336
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,480
it interferes with sleep so you should

337
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,579
only have caffeine in the morning one

338
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,899
hour after you wake up not immediately

339
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,640
immediately after you wake up that's

340
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,260
important because it prevents a caffeine

341
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,880
crash later on in the day but make sure

342
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,459
you aren't using one of those nasty ass

343
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,100
coffee machines the reason is it sends

344
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,260
the hot water through plastic tubes into

345
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,880
your coffee and even if the water is

346
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,200
pure because the hot water is running

347
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,180
through plastic tubes it's going to pick

348
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,680
up the talates from the plastic tube and

349
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,360
make your coffee estrogenic so be

350
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,220
careful there so what supplement can you

351
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,500
take to actually improve your sleep well

352
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,360
I got the solution for you the esoteric

353
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,300
sleep elixir

354
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
book five blue light you already know

355
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,480
this one I'm not gonna waste your time

356
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,220
blue light glasses do work to some

357
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,720
extent but you shouldn't be using your

358
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,100
screens and phone two hours before

359
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,779
sleeping I'll give you some information

360
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,459
which you didn't know watching the

361
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,899
sunset is actually an important part of

362
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,820
your sleep routine if you watch the

363
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,079
sunlight go down the way the wavelengths

364
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,579
interact with your eye informs your

365
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,740
brain at its sleep time and that

366
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,720
actually protects you from the blue

367
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,180
light radiation from your phones but

368
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,800
even more important than that is waking

369
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,240
up in the morning and actually stepping

370
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,220
outside your home and getting some

371
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,720
direct sunlight into your eyes no

372
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,399
sunglasses nothing guess you're outside

373
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,540
of the home and you're looking in the

374
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,339
direction of the sun you don't have to

375
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,680
literally look at the sun just look in

376
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,420
the direction of the sun this is very

377
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,459
very important because of three reasons

378
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,620
one it's going to recharge your dopamine

379
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,180
which is going to affect literally every

380
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,040
single component of your life and I'm

381
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,240
going to go into this in detail in the

382
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,860
next video I make which is going to be

383
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
the most important video I make called

384
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,940
your brain on porn I'm going to teach

385
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,560
you literally how to break your porn

386
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,500
addiction for the rest of your life and

387
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,700
a big component of that is a dopamine

388
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,600
recharge so getting sunlight early in

389
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,860
the morning is actually an important

390
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,240
part of that but not just for the

391
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,100
dopamine though getting sunlight in the

392
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,320
morning is going to purge your brain of

393
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,579
melatonin and adenosine which are not

394
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,959
bad compounds or anything but they're

395
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,640
sleep compounds so you don't really want

396
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,200
them in the morning sunlight will

397
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,760
literally reject all those from your

398
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,380
brain making you ready for the rest of

399
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,519
your day what about artificial light so

400
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,779
just like your lights would light up

401
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,180
your room during the night is that okay

402
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,160
actually no I have a programmable light

403
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,920
which I'll show you on screen it turns

404
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,459
red literally automatically turns red at

405
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,980
10 pm and it turns off automatically at

406
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,660
midnight for me I prefer midnight but

407
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,579
the ideal like the scientifically proven

408
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,260
best time to sleep is 10 pm find out

409
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,060
what works for you for me midnight seems

410
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,220
to work well so my light literally turns

411
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,440
red automatically at 10 pm it turns off

412
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,860
literally at midnight and in the morning

413
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,200
automatically turns on at 7 00 am which

414
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,700
signals my brain and my body and it's

415
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,100
time to wake up so that's right I don't

416
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,500
use an alarm I use this automatic light

417
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,959
as an alarm when the lights go on it

418
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,639
gives my body the cue to wake up and I

419
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,959
just gradually wake up naturally instead

420
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,639
of being Jarred awake by an alarm

421
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,860
because you don't sleep in a linear

422
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,480
fashion you sleep in a cycle and when

423
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,100
you have an alarm it might jar you out

424
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
of deep sleep and you'll just feel

425
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,399
groggy and tired for the rest of the day

426
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,019
so much better to use a light alarm

427
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,519
rather than an actual like sound alarm

428
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,160
in addition to the red light in my room

429
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,200
I'll also use candles or an oil lamp

430
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,399
instead of like actual lights but if

431
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,320
you're going to use a candle be sure

432
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,880
that it's a beeswax candle not one of

433
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
these artificial candles which have

434
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,660
scent in them because when you have a

435
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,120
scented candle these release toxins into

436
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,459
the air if you have a bird like if you

437
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,019
own Birds you'll know for a fact that

438
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,519
you should never have a scented candle

439
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,620
why because a birds literally die

440
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
because of the toxins present in your

441
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,220
scent of candles so it's literally a

442
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,040
canary in the coal mine type situation

443
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,480
book six mental game sometimes you can

444
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,220
have the perfect night routine and

445
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,800
everything but when you lay down to

446
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,940
sleep your thoughts just start racing

447
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,519
you know your mind is racing you're

448
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,860
thinking of past the present the future

449
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,200
you're making plans you're strategizing

450
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,540
and you simply aren't able to fall

451
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,399
asleep this is a common problem for me

452
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
and the way I got around this is by

453
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,040
using the techniques which I'm going to

454
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,600
show you right now but before we go into

455
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,300
the techniques the best way to actually

456
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,279
fall asleep is by closing all the loops

457
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,779
let me explain if you're an overthinker

458
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,820
if you're having racing thoughts at

459
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,040
night the reason why this is happening

460
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,899
is because you didn't have a productive

461
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,240
day there was a lot of things you wanted

462
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,040
to do during the day but you didn't get

463
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,199
them done for one reason or another your

464
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,820
brain leaves those Loops running so what

465
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,680
happens is your brain is constantly

466
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,940
thinking of ways to correct that you

467
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,500
know Finding ways to complete those

468
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,660
tasks but if you have an actually

469
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,459
productive day and you knock out all the

470
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,339
tasks that you intended to do your brain

471
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,320
closes all those loops and says to your

472
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,380
body it's time to sleep your brain

473
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
finally goes into wholesome beautiful

474
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,500
detoxifying sleep so I'll give you two

475
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,940
techniques both of them adapted from the

476
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,560
kind of the army technique which I was

477
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,420
taught in basic training which basically

478
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,880
allows you to communicate with your body

479
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,860
and tell it to not be in the fight or

480
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,899
flight mode and rather be in the rest

481
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,339
and relax mode it's not very surprising

482
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,019
that a soldier's life on the battlefield

483
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,699
can be extremely stressful and that's an

484
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,500
understatement so the Army actually came

485
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,959
up with sleep techniques to make sure

486
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,699
that soldiers and Pilots get good

487
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,680
quality sleep even if they are

488
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,639
chronically stressed I've modified these

489
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,560
a little bit and I'm going to give you

490
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,540
like a simplified and easy version which

491
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,120
is just as effective so this is a body

492
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,980
scan what you're doing is when you're

493
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,420
laying on your bed you're laying flat on

494
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,800
your bed so on your back and you have

495
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,899
the pillow under your knees like I

496
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,540
mentioned before you place one hand on

497
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,399
your chest and one hand on your belly as

498
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,260
you're lying flat on your back so you

499
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,360
can literally feel your breathing enter

500
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,699
your nose to your chest to your belly

501
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,500
and then out the same way and as you're

502
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,839
feeling your breathing what you're going

503
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,660
to do is a body scan so you're going to

504
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,820
start by thinking and focusing on the

505
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,620
top of your head and work your way down

506
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,180
to the base of your feet other people

507
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,100
say that you should start at the feet

508
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,600
and go to your head they're wrong this

509
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,220
is a better way to do it I promise so

510
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,079
you literally go body part by body part

511
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,120
so you start with your scalp your

512
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,480
forehead eyebrows eyes nose mouth

513
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,740
whatever it is your neck shoulders arms

514
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,139
body torso glutes ties calves feet you

515
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,720
think of each of these parts and you

516
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,300
essentially wish them well you wish them

517
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,160
relaxation and peace and you in fact

518
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,660
give these parts of your body gratitude

519
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,880
for doing such a great job during the

520
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,740
day this tells your body it's in rest

521
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,839
and relaxed mode it's essentially a way

522
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,459
you communicate between the mind and the

523
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,019
body and you do this through your

524
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,699
breathing so every time you're focusing

525
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,620
on a body part you're taking in a deep

526
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,600
breath and then visualizing the stress

527
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,459
leaving you as you breathe out like I

528
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,740
said the hands are placed on your chest

529
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,419
and belly so you can literally feel the

530
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,939
air going in and out and that is going

531
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,860
to relieve the stress from your body and

532
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,600
help you go to sleep in about 10 minutes

533
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,220
if you want me to cover more esoteric

534
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,199
topics like lucid dreaming let me know

535
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,280
in the comments another esoteric concept

536
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,780
is nsdr non-sleep deep rest which was

537
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,059
traditionally known for thousands and

538
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,699
tens of thousands of years as Yoga Nidra

539
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,280
which means yogic sleep essentially and

540
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,620
this is a science approved and tradition

541
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,700
approved rest practice which I'll have

542
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,039
to make a separate video because it's

543
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,600
essentially like a guided meditation you

544
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,220
aren't sleeping but you're deriving most

545
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,200
of the benefits of sleep you can do this

546
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,880
anytime including at night or the day

547
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
and it restores your dopamine and you

548
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,940
can increase your productivity like

549
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
crazy so make that separate video and

550
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,240
you can use that as a special resource

551
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,179
now going on to the topic of Dreams

552
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,799
should you pay any heed to dreams you

553
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,660
know I have personal opinion absolutely

554
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,100
yes in the modern world we've kind of

555
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,720
discarded the idea of Dreams nobody even

556
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,880
talks about dreams even in other sleep

557
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,500
related videos no one talks about dreams

558
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
it's almost like a non-scientific thing

559
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,980
but that's not true some of the greatest

560
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,260
inventions the greatest pieces of music

561
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,260
the greatest pieces of art have come

562
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,760
from the dreams of these artists hell

563
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,559
you know the movie Terminator apparently

564
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,539
came from James Cameron's dreams

565
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,980
literally the structure of DNA the

566
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,500
structure of benzene a million other

567
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,120
inventions have come from our dreams and

568
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
most probably you don't even dream do

569
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,660
you they did a very interesting

570
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,880
experiment on mice so they took a bunch

571
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,380
of mice put them through a maze and then

572
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,660
they had these like probes in their

573
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,220
brain recording every single like neural

574
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,600
impulse as they're going through the

575
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,700
Maze and then when they were sleeping

576
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
they put the probes back in to see what

577
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,120
they were dreaming about and sure enough

578
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,440
the mice were actually dreaming of their

579
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,660
Journey Through The Maze and here's

580
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,240
what's interesting they dreamed of going

581
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,520
through the maze linearly they dreamed

582
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,200
going backwards and they dreamed even

583
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,760
skipping portions off the maze

584
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,500
essentially they were doing a complex

585
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,059
problem-solving thing in their brain

586
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,160
during their dreams and finding out

587
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,320
alternate creative ways to navigate that

588
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,940
maze so a mouse can do that kind of

589
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,460
creative thinking then imagine what

590
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,320
power we have as human beings now

591
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,940
afternoon naps should you sleep during

592
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,860
the afternoon answer is actually yes

593
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,900
sleeping during the afternoon is known

594
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,000
to boost brain function mental health

595
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,860
mental Clarity everything however it may

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,200
not be practical for a lot of us in

597
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,900
which case it should resort to nsdr

598
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,880
which I mentioned before book Seven

599
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,980
waking up if you want an esoteric

600
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,539
morning routine guide let me know I'll

601
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,679
make video but for here I'll just say

602
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,000
the one thing which I already said

603
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,740
before you need to get out of your house

604
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
house and get some direct sunlight in

605
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,200
the morning that should be the most

606
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,820
important part of your morning routine

607
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,500
literally fixes other problems in your

608
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,440
life and also say something about diet

609
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,120
eat eggs eat mushrooms these ones have

610
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
vitamin D which your body synthesizes

611
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
and helps you regulate your circadian

612
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,520
rhythm by the way if you literally want

become wiser and smarter links in the

625
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,280
description book 8 esoteric nighttime

626
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,200
routine a key component of your

627
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,700
nighttime routine needs to be regulating

628
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,960
your body temperature so here's what you

629
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,880
do you get yourself a little spray

630
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,100
bottle of water or of course you can

631
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,140
splash water from your sink you spray

632
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,660
your forearms with water and you spray

633
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,700
your face with water you spray your ears

634
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,919
and your neck with water this allows

635
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,080
your body to eject extra heat cools your

636
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,120
body down and it's very very important

637
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,620
for high quality sleep next thing you

638
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,840
should take your phone turn it

639
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,480
completely off and put it aside why

640
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,240
because your phone is always radiating

641
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,340
something called RF emws radio frequency

642
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,240
electromagnetic waves and these are

643
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,559
shown to be bad for living tissue it's

644
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,000
bad for your testosterone production

645
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,320
it's bad for your sperm production it's

646
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,360
bad for your heart it's bad for your

647
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,700
brain spending nine hours with a phone

648
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,080
next to you terrible idea put it aside

649
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,299
my guys and you know how I have the

650
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,340
psyak method using science intuition

651
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,200
observation and philosophy this is not

652
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,539
my observation or intuition this is

653
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,700
literally science showing you that your

654
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,840
phone is bad for you I literally linked

655
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,340
the studies in the description below if

656
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,400
you want to check them out book nine

657
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,799
visualization imagine it's 10 pm you've

658
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,299
already completed the day's tasks you've

659
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,059
had an immensely productive day

660
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,980
literally you're weeks ahead of your

661
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,919
12-week plan even though others haven't

662
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,140
seen the change you know that things are

663
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,760
getting serious momentum the automatic

664
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,500
red lights have come on you've completed

665
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,299
your sleep routine you've already had

666
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,940
your chamomile tea and you're feeling

667
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,100
slightly tired there's a slight bit of

668
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,080
soreness from the powerful workout you

669
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,780
completed earlier in the day you sit

670
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,059
down on your slightly cold bed you take

671
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,400
a deep breath and do a full body scan

672
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,620
every part of your body checks out as

673
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,140
fully operational and before you know it

674
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,600
you're asleep when you awake the next

675
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,460
day you feel massive energy surging

676
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,900
through your body you have a massive

677
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,820
erection you barely can piss because

678
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,100
your dick is so hard and when you manage

679
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,440
that you get a big drink of the

680
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,940
electrolyte Elixir and you step out into

681
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,460
the Sun the sunlight is a little bit

682
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,900
strong at first but your eyes adjust

683
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,780
then you feel an additional surge of

684
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,340
energy as you realize not a single task

685
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,500
today will be too difficult for you to

686
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,260
conquer everything will fall into place

687
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,480
as though by divine intervention for the

688
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,059
forces of chaos have no chance when the

689
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,039
forces of Heaven have got your back as I

690
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,419
told you the spine Integrity is the most

691
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,059
important part of your brain

692
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,260
detoxification as you sleep so I'm going

693
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,059
to show you the stretches which is going

694
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,460
to help with this first we're going to

695
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,220
start off in shivasana which is just

696
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,419
laying down so just laying down flat on

697
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,640
the mat

698
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,640
and you're going to do

699
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,220
exactly as I say so I am literally a

700
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,740
certified yoga instructor so I know what

701
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm talking about so you lie down flat

702
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,659
on your back

703
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,900
and first thing

704
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,480
let out a nice deep breath so that

705
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,799
you're nice and controlled you're in the

706
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,360
present

707
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,980
it's actually important to get your mind

708
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,740
right when you're doing this that does

709
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,960
genuinely help with muscle relaxation

710
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,260
so once you're here

711
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,580
you're going to take your left leg

712
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,860
Point left toes upwards arms at a 45

713
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,780
degree angle to your torso

714
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,580
and you're going to drop the left leg

715
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,919
across your body

716
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,580
and your gaze is going to shift to the

717
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,580
opposite direction

718
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,919
you can use this offhand to secure your

719
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,260
knee it's up to you

720
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,080
and you'll spend some time here

721
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,700
and I'm trying to not let my shoulders

722
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,380
raise off the ground so I'm not letting

723
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,299
myself do something like this the

724
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,620
shoulders remain flat

725
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,360
and this is going to give you a nice

726
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,220
stretch on your glutes and of course

727
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,860
you're going to get a nice spinal twist

728
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,940
which is the objective then we use our

729
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,200
hand

730
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:57,059
to move the knee back to neutral

731
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,440
drop it down of course I'm going a

732
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,600
little bit fast because of the nature of

733
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,880
YouTube but you would take as much time

734
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,580
as you need you'll take your right leg

735
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,900
drop it across the body and move your

736
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,240
gaze to the opposite side

737
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,340
and spend some time here as long as it

738
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,620
feels comfortable to you

739
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,840
take your left hand

740
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,220
move the knee back

741
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,140
to neutral

742
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,480
drop it down

743
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,340
then you do a figure four stretch so

744
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,679
you'll get your left leg bent at the

745
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,020
knee take your right leg and actually

746
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,020
bend it across your left leg bringing

747
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,840
the right ankle to left knee and from

748
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,980
here we'll take our right hand and push

749
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,799
away

750
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:45,440
on the right knee so you get a nice

751
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,440
stretch on the hip flexor muscles

752
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,580
and of course you can actually take your

753
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,340
right hand pass it through the Gap clasp

754
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,799
left knee bring your left hand around

755
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:59,159
clasp left knee and bring the entire hip

756
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,320
girdle off the ground that's a nice big

757
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,840
glute stretch very very useful if you

758
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,120
spend a lot of time sitting and working

759
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,460
100 useful if you want a full video on

760
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,679
all the most effective stretches let me

761
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,419
know and I will make that it'll be

762
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,580
probably one of the most important

763
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,679
reasons I make because if you have a

764
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,539
good stretching routine

765
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,059
and you actually implement it day after

766
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,980
day it's genuinely a life-changing

767
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,260
addition to your life huge return on

768
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,940
investment so once you're done with your

769
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,279
figure four stretch

770
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,360
you can actually sit up

771
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,679
and get into a nice deep squat so deep

772
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,179
squat literally what it sounds like

773
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,600
you're going to sit down nice and deep

774
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,159
now if you are more experienced and you

775
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,779
can do crazy stuff like you know balance

776
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,340
on one leg and everything but you don't

777
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:48,120
need to do that a nice deep squat is

778
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,340
going to give you a lot of spine Bend

779
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,900
I'm allowing my lower back to bend it's

780
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,760
not like a weighted squat you're not

781
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,559
trying to maintain a squat position

782
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,059
you're actually trying to get as Loose

783
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,460
as possible

784
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:05,400
and then from here

785
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:07,260
we are going to go into a cobra sequence

786
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,140
so we'll start off

787
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,480
kind of in a push-up position arms are

788
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,580
by your chest level

789
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,020
your feet are pointed to the ground so

790
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,539
you're flat

791
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,820
you'll press up

792
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,220
and allow your hips to Sag so you're not

793
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,860
doing a push-up you're just doing a

794
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,500
cobra pose it's called and you're

795
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,240
letting your shoulders ride forward

796
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,159
and this is your Cobra post so it's kind

797
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,080
of the opposite of the deep squat right

798
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,539
it's stretching the spine in the

799
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,679
opposite direction so hold this for a

800
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,900
little bit as long as it's comfortable

801
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,360
for you

802
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,720
and drop it down

803
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,880
and then you'll go into a quad stretch

804
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,179
so just sit back

805
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,500
on your ankles so I'm not able to do

806
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:59,520
this properly because I took a Savage

807
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,320
kick to my left knee while kickboxing

808
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,779
then you're gonna take your hands place

809
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,919
them slightly behind you and then

810
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:09,779
lean backwards and open up your chest

811
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,760
very good for your spinal Integrity it's

812
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,400
also good for your shoulders and traps

813
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,100
and everything and then we go into a

814
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,900
child's pose which is the opposite

815
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,240
you'll start by putting your elbows in

816
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,960
the ground your forearms your palms your

817
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,539
forehead and this is a child's pose

818
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,640
you can increase the distance between

819
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,340
your knees and really sink into it it's

820
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,779
up to you spend as much time in this

821
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,140
position as you want it's a nice rest

822
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,140
position

823
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,120
then you'll walk it back come back to

824
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,059
where you were

825
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:48,539
and then I like to finish it off with a

826
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:51,240
massage gun so I got this Bob and Brad

827
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,440
massage guns literally you press this

828
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,059
button

829
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,820
and

830
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,820
I place it on my traps because trap is

831
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,260
where I tend to get tense

832
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,900
I'll put a link to it in the description

833
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,400
so I know I went a little bit fast and

834
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,679
that's because of the nature of this

835
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,360
particular video but if you want an

836
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,799
actual guide like an in-depth guide on

837
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,740
how to actually do the stuff properly

838
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,539
along with a morning stretch routine let

839
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,740
me know and I'll make it after my trip

840
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:19,919
to Europe that's right I'm actually

841
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,120
going to Portugal Spain France and Italy

842
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,740

843
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,720
