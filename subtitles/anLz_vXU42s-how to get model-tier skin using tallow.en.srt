1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,440
most YouTubers like freaking Alpha M

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,839
will give you five products that you

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,840
need they'll give you an AM cream a PM

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,360
cream a scrub a cleanser and an eye

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,080
cream and all of these are supposed to

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,119
be required a requirement for your skin

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,480
to look good this is BS I will share

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,720
with you ancient wisdom 10,000 years old

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,119
wisdom to help you have the best hair

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,359
and skin you've ever had in your life

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,519
this video is not just about sunscreen

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,879
but we might as well start start there

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,879
the first scop sunscreen so sunburn is

14
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,800
not a problem which I ever had sunburn

15
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,160
is a white person problem however I used

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,920
to think that if you don't have

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,239
sunscreen on you you'll straight up get

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,280
skin cancer which is not true in fact

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll tell you something interesting most

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,920
sunscreen all major brands they contain

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,519
either benzo phenone or 4 MBC benzeno

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,680
and 4 MBC are estrogenics and

23
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,720
estrogenics are known to be cancer

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,600
causing I blame the seed oils

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,080
polyunsaturated fatty acids integrate

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,280
themselves into your cell membrane in

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,040
your skin and they caus the skin to be

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,080
more sensitive to sunburn so they added

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,000
a foreign substance seed oils to our

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,040
diet which caused a problem excessive

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,960
Sunburn and skin cancer even and then

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,240
they came up with a product which is

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,520
supposed to solve that problem and sold

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,200
us sunscreen this is exactly what the

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,040
esoteric Health movement opposes all

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,119
major brands like freaking Jurgens which

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,520
you should never use contain either

38
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,799
parabens or Tates or benzines or phenols

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,439
in general if an ingredient has the word

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,719
Benz or fi as a part of its name I try

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,399
to avoid it almost every single major

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,399
brand every single major product has

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,479
parabens tads 4 MBC or benzophenone if

44
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
it's a sunscreen the sub substances I

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,719
mentioned are estrogenics they are

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,000
endocrine disrupting which means that

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,800
they interfere with your hormone systems

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,599
and if you specifically look at the

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,000
sunscreen estrogenics which is

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,200
benzophenone and 4 MBC what's going on

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,319
here is very interesting these molecules

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
they bind to the cell membrane of our

53
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,840
skin cells and the sun radiation UV

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
radiation actually fuses them onto the

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,920
membrane so not only are they signaling

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,519
estrogenic Pathways they are actually

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,720
fused by the UV radiation and they

58
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,640
remain affixed to the skin cell

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,959
literally for the entire life cycle of

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,120
the cell until it dies so not only is an

61
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,599
estrogenic substance it actually gets

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
worse when exposed to sunlight which is

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,720
ridiculous because sunscreen is supposed

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,120
to be used in sunlight so what should

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,280
you do well I have this video for you

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,159
which is the esoteric skin care system

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,040
but listen it doesn't start with the

68
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,519
products it actually starts with the

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,959
water your water your tap water

70
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,440
regardless of where you live on the

71
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,519
globe contains fluorides and chlorine

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,480
definitely chlorine so chlorine is what

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
they use to kill bacteria in your water

74
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,239
right so here's the problem chlorine

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
literally kills cells it literally

76
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,760
causes DNA damage in order to kill

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,720
bacterial cells and that's true for your

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,599
gut microbiome that's also true for your

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,400
mouth microbiome but of course when it

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
comes to the skin it causes skin damage

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
and I I bet you've never even heard of

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,040
what a shower filter is so here's the

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
interesting thing most skin problems can

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,519
be solved by just getting a shower

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,799
filter just remove the chlorine and

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
you'll be fine half the time but you'll

87
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,680
never hear a dermatologist talk about a

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,640
shower filter cuz you know they lose

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,840
their jobs so shower filter that's

90
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,599
priority number one get yourself one I

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
briefly mentioned fluoride but the deal

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
with fluoride is way too complex to go

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,519
into this video I have a video out on

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,000
that go check it out I'll put in the

95
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,799
description next thing you do is cut out

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,920
seed oils from your diet so like I

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,000
mentioned before seed oils poly

98
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,560
unsaturated fat fatty acids integrate

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,720
themselves in the cell membranes of your

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,079
skin and cause them to be more prone to

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
Sunburn and sun damage in general now

102
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,680
finally coming to what products to use

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,000
and I literally have just one product

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,280
and well this one is empty I have

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,759
literally one product which is called

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,400
Tallow balb you probably haven't even

107
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,040
heard of Tallow Bal but this was the

108
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,039
moisturizer and sunscreen which people

109
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,520
used tens of thousands of years before

110
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:35,520
we switched over to our modern and

111
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,080
inferior products Tallow bom is esoteric

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,280
certified but what is it right so Tallow

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,199
bom is nothing it's just Tallow Tallow

114
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,479
is animal fat rendered and purified

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,759
that's literally all it is I think it's

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,600
just one ingredient in here and this is

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
the only one which I use I don't have a

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,479
separate eye cream I don't have an AM

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,520
cream and a PM cream I don't have a

120
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,080
retinol so here's here's something

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,759
interesting Tallow bom contains a lot of

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,600
vitamin A which is retinol so some

123
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,080
people buy a whole retinol product for

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
that purpose this has that in it as well

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,800
another scop aftershave this is better

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,680
than any After Shave you'll find in any

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
store so humans have been using Tallow

128
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,720
bom for tens of thousands of years

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,360
probably more and we live in interesting

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,600
times it's finally a time in which small

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,560
businesses and small farms are able to

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,039
come up with high quality products at

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,960
scale to allow you know manufacturer

134
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,800
that we can all afford to get they can

135
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,880
successfully compete with and win

136
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,120
against these big Brands and I'm all for

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,520
supporting small businesses who have a

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,759
strong Mission and are making good

139
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,360
products this is one example of that the

140
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,600
TB bomb which I use is by a brand called

141
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,680
vintage tradition there are other brands

142
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,240
which you can go to I know the owner of

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,120
this brand which is why I trust it more

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
than any other brand guy called Kenneth

145
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,840
he and his brother run this thing they

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,400
only use the highest quality ingredients

147
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,199
I trust them if you want to check this

148
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,759
brand out in particular they were

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
actually able to give me a discount code

150
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,759
so you can check it out out I put in the

151
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,960
description I think the reason why tbom

152
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,720
works so well because it's an animal

153
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,440
product so we're animals the fat profile

154
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,840
the fatty acid profile of plants and

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,280
animals are simply different so even

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759
things like Shia butter Etc yeah they do

157
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,599
the job and they're organic and

158
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,400
everything but they're simply not able

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,319
to compete with an animal fat-based

160
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,599
product which is why this is nice it

161
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:28,160
contains you know all the vitamins a B12

162
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,599
k d in a bioavailable form so I think

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
that's why it's supered though I don't

164
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,280
have any scientific studies or anything

165
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
proving that I just have personal

166
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,160
experience and from my personal

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,599
experience this is easily the way to go

168
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,000
interesting story I read the book

169
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,120
estrogenics which I strongly recommend

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,680
it's a deep dive into all topics

171
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,520
estrogenics related right and he

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,319
mentions the author mentions that

173
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,199
lavender so check this product out it's

174
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,840
a pretty good product no parabens no

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,360
Tates but it has lavender lavender is an

176
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,639
estrogenic substance but not so stri

177
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,879
straightforward so most lavender on the

178
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,039
market today like which they use in

179
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,919
fragrances and whatnot is artificial

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,280
lavender and it's the artificial

181
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,520
lavender which is estrogenic natural

182
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,400
organic lavender from the actual plant

183
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,759
doesn't seem to be estrogenic so if you

184
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,000
find a Tallow bomb which has a lavender

185
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,039
essential oil in it from this company

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,680
it's fine because I know the guy he he

187
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,759
confirmed that he only gets his lavender

188
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,800
from Plants but other brands which have

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,599
lavender I would be suspicious of

190
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,280
especially your detergents if if your

191
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,240
detergent has a lavender scent highly

192
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,199
suspicious that's probably artificial

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
lavender you shouldn't use it try to go

194
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,240
for odorless as much as possible but

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
literally everything I spoke about till

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,960
now is completely irrelevant without a

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,639
solid diet and sleep so regarding sleep

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,280
if you want a esoteric sleep guide let

199
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,280
me know in the comments and I'll make

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,960
that and diet half the skincare routine

201
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
videos on YouTube have nothing to do

202
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,560
with diet they say nothing about diet

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,440
diet is more important than the products

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,039
that you use So speaking specifically

205
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,479
about skin care and its relationship

206
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,639
with diet carrots carrots are important

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,759
the beta carotenes in carrots literally

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,680
adds pigmentation to your skin makes you

209
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,400
look good eat your carrots then you need

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,000
collagen chicken skins very good source

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,840
of collagen eat your chicken skins but

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
then it may not be sufficient especially

213
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,159
because you aren't eating chicken skins

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
every day or anything I would suggest

215
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,159
supplementation with a collagen powder

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
so collagen powder is just a white

217
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,200
powder looks kind of like whe protein it

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,200
just dissolves in water gives you

219
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,680
collagen and here's something

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,839
interesting about collagen collagen can

221
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,680
break down into Glycine and glycine

222
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,760
improve your sleep so diet plus sleep in

223
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,440
this particular supplement but is Tallow

224
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,800
balb a sunscreen it's not so here's the

225
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,519
thing though and some of you might

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,519
actually still need sunscreen maybe you

227
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,200
are just a very pale skin and your skin

228
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,920
just burns in the sun I understand that

229
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
so I will put in the description some

230
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,000
sunscreens which are actually clean and

231
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,880
which you are okay to use which don't

232
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,240
have estrogenic substances I'll also

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,800
provide non Tallow moisturizers and

234
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
recommendations because in case you

235
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,880
wen't able to get the product or because

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,560
you don't want to use it for whatever

237
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,360
reasons then I would suggest those

238
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,399
products instead coming back to cleaning

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,880
your face most YouTube videos will

240
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,160
suggest a cleanser and a scrub they say

241
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,320
that the scrub is required for

242
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,920
exfoliation not true but coming for the

243
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,399
cleaning first right I use this cream

244
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,240
cleanser very gentle very moisturizing

245
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
it's a good product so I said facial

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,640
scrubs were BS which is true but you

247
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,000
should possibly use this bentonite clay

248
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,959
calcium bentonite clay so this stuff is

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,680
not a exfoliant it won't like rub and we

250
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,519
your skin it's a clay it's like a face

251
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,839
mask you can read the instructions and

252
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,959
follow them you basically mix the powder

253
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,440
it's like a powder I'll show you it's

254
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,640
like a powder very fine clay powder I

255
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,000
don't know how well you can see it but

256
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,000
you take that stuff and you mix it with

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,040
water or ideally Apple cider vinegar you

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,279
mix it up it becomes a paste you apply

259
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,399
the paste onto your face and then after

260
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,200
10 minutes you just wash it off and your

261
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,440
skin guaranteed will look better and

262
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,440
this is superior to any stupid face

263
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,240
scrub which people are selling now what

264
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,800
do you use of body wash because body

265
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
wash well this is a pretty good body

266
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,279
wash to be honest but even this does

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,760
does contain the artificial lavender so

268
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,760
I don't use it most body wash is pretty

269
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
terrible it has the same issues the

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,640
parabens the Tates everything so what

271
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,839
I've gone to using is a literal bar soap

272
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,519
this is also by the same company vintage

273
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
tradition it's literally a bar soap made

274
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,440
from Tallow it's very good I've been

275
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
using it but I'm sure this is not the

276
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
only company which makes similar stuff

277
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,720
right get a bar soap get a good bar soap

278
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,320
it doesn't necessarily have to be Tallow

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
and you might be thinking how often do

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
you do all this you wash your face once

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,959
in the morning and once at night with a

282
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,680
gentle cream cleanser you apply the

283
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,240
Tallow bomb after youve wash your face

284
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,279
the bent toight clay I only use it once

285
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
a week and of course you shower every

286
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,720
day with the bar soap now coming to Hair

287
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,680
Care the first thing most important

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,600
thing is get yourself a wooden comb

289
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,399
don't be using a plastic comb get

290
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,320
yourself a wooden what do you call these

291
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,079
things like wooden barbs and this is

292
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,440
just so much better for your scalp than

293
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,440
the plastic ones are and then shampoo so

294
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
shampoos which contain Tates Tates

295
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,800
damage your hair follicles if you're

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
balding it's a good chance it's the

297
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,040
Tates which are causing it so make sure

298
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,040
that your shampoo is good quality which

299
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,480
means no parabens no Tate no estrogenic

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,440
of any kind so that's this is a good

301
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,800
shampoo which I found it's sulfate free

302
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,600
paraben talate free and of course you

303
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,600
don't have to use this brand necessarily

304
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,560
I'll show you this brand in uh in the

305
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,000
link you can check it out then after you

306
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,360
shower after you wash your hair you

307
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,680
still want to have a way to moisturize

308
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,639
your hair what do you use well the most

309
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,760
esoteric answer is olive oil that's

310
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,920
correct so just one or two drops of

311
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,000
olive oil spread it out in your hands

312
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,519
apply it you'll get that shine you'll

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,800
get the moisture speaking about my hair

314
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,680
so I started this video talking about

315
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,959
how my hair was turning gray when I was

316
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
freaking 20 and I I plugged it out

317
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,160
because you know I I was insecure about

318
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,320
having gray hair at that young age now

319
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,160
my hair is super thick super strong and

320
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,399
if I go to a hairdresser right every

321
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,839
time the the hairdresser lady she'll

322
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,880
comment like oh my God your hair is so

323
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,279
thick it's hard to cut you're going to

324
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,440
blunt my scissors so it went from really

325
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,279
bad quality hair which is graying to

326
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,279
very thick and strong hair which is

327
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,560
noticeable right you can see how much

328
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
wume I have it's because of the olive

329
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,800
oil and of course removing the Tad from

330
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,760
my shampoo can you use coconut oil yes

331
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,760
you can use coconut oil but the thing is

332
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,560
I don't like the smell of coconut oil

333
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,360
olive oil smell kind of just vanishes

334
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,279
after a couple minutes so it's fine and

335
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
then olive oil isn't sufficient cuz I

336
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,360
still want to kind of have some texture

337
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,079
some style some hold in my hair so I use

338
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,240
this particular product Seattle Pomade

339
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,160
company so this is an excellent product

340
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,279
it's very cheap surprisingly cheap this

341
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,440
is just beeswax essentially the the base

342
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,040
is beeswax and then they add some honey

343
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
fragrance or something like that and not

344
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,120
an artificial fragrance by the way so

345
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
I'll link this also in the description

346
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,920
this you just take it in your hand apply

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,399
it on your hair and you get this nice

348
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,000
texture nice hold otherwise my hair

349
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,199
would just kind of flop down so I mean

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,920
you might have to find the right product

351
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,880
for yourself but this is the one which I

352
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,279
use and for your body what do you use to

353
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,639
moisturize your body skin Tallow works

354
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,079
as well as it does on your face you

355
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,680
don't need another product you can use

356
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,199
your Tallow if you aren't able to get

357
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,800
yourself some Tallow you can actually

358
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,279
use all olive oil just take a couple

359
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,440
drops of olive oil and drop it on your

360
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,839
skin and that's the best you can do but

361
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,079
if for whatever reason you don't want to

362
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,320
use olive oil there are some good brands

363
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,600
I have this everyday Shia butter type

364
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,519
lotion which I do use this is a good

365
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
product pretty clean no parabens no

366
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,880
