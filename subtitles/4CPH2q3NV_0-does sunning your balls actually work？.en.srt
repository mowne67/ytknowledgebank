1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
the morning is not something that

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,759
happens it's something you do your balls

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,740
will literally get bigger if you follow

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,200
this guide most people don't know this

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,960
but literally every single cell in your

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,299
body has a little clock and when these

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,340
little clocks get out of sync that's

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,320
when you feel like [ __ ] that's why when

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,119
you go to a new time zone you might have

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,760
digestive issues you might have brain

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,980
fog you might get sick more easily most

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,960
people live their entire lives feeling

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,300
like [ __ ] because they don't know the

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,340
importance of sinking their clocks and

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,219
most people don't know that their skin

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,680
is literally the biggest endocrine organ

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,260
in the entire body literally getting

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,059
sunlight on your skin increases your

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,620
testosterone production and your

20
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,260
dopamine levels what does that mean it

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,520
means that not only become more manly in

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,460
the sense that you have bigger balls

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,500
bigger shaft more aggressive more muscle

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,420
Etc you also have more dopamine which

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,239
means you're much better much much

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,579
better at goal Pursuit so whether you're

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,399
striving for success in like Finance or

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,619
women or sports or whatever it is the

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,180
dopamine gold Pursuit angle is going to

30
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,740
make you far more successful than

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,740
anybody around you that's because

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,680
dopamine is not the molecule of pleasure

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,020
dopamine is the molecule of Drive of

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,939
Forward Motion it's the molecule of

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,100
satisfaction and happiness when you

36
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,200
achieve the goal that you set out to as

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,420
important as increasing testosterone is

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,880
increasing your Baseline dopamine level

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,080
because that alongside with testosterone

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,400
is going to take you to a whole

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,900
different level and if you're a woman

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,040
it's even more important for you because

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,020
the sunlight is going to help you

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
regulate your sleep cycles and that's

45
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,159
going to help you regulate your

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,200
menstrual cycle and that is the sacred

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,880
source of your feminine power very

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,439
interesting then that the sun has been

49
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,700
so demonized they make you think that as

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,439
soon as you step out in the sun if

51
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,060
you're not wearing sunglasses and like a

52
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,340
pound of sunscreen you'll immediately

53
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,960
Sprout tumors like freaking Deadpool so

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,920
you need to get outside first thing in

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,899
the morning because what it's going to

56
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,579
do is it's going to purge your brain off

57
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,840
the Sleep chemicals and not only that

58
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,640
but it's also going to give you a

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
cortisol Spike you might think that

60
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,820
cards soul is a stressful hormone and

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
it's bad that's not the case there's no

62
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,759
such thing as a bad hormone it's more so

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,619
that different hormones have different

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
purposes and sometimes because of the

65
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,220
modern things that we do these chemicals

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,680
get out of sync it's actually that

67
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,360
cortisol Spike which gets your internal

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
clocks in sync so I told you every

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,040
single cell has its own clock it's that

70
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,900
cortisol Spike that makes all the clocks

71
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,400
synchronize and literally get your body

72
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,140
in order and of course if you do the

73
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,700
opposite if you don't get outside and

74
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,319
get some sun early in the morning your

75
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,840
cortisol spike is still going to happen

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,000
but it's going to happen later in the

77
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,860
day and this is a bad thing because this

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,900
is going to result in other mental

79
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,459
problems it's going to result in lower

80
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,620
dopamine depressions it's going to

81
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,060
result in low testosterone I want you to

82
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,280
think of this very carefully why are

83
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,220
doctors prescribing antidepressants

84
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,140
before first prescribing sunlight early

85
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,879
morning sunlight as the first therapy

86
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,040
first line of defense against depression

87
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,360
well for one thing sunlight is free it

88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,760
can make money off of it so you might

89
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,319
have the question should you Sun your

90
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,300
balls this has been a thing on social

91
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,920
media it's been like a meme almost it's

92
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,120
on your balls to me doesn't make a lot

93
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,700
of sense because the way the system

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,800
works is your balls are the factory of

95
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,720
sperm and testosterone yes but the on

96
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,879
off switch is actually a pituitary gland

97
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,500
in your brain and the way you stimulate

98
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,019
it is actually getting sunlight on your

99
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,580
eyeballs especially morning sunlight is

100
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,319
going to turn on your pituitary gland

101
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,340
that's going to Signal your balls and

102
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,480
your balls are going to produce a

103
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,739
testosterone it's not like you can get

104
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,540
more testosterone by just sunning your

105
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,400
balls directly that being said maybe the

106
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,720
science simply isn't there yet maybe in

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,920
the next 20 years you'll find out that

108
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,239
actually stunning your balls does help

109
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,980
so you can try it it's not going to hurt

110
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,480
you try it and tell me what happens but

111
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,760
as of right now I think it's more of a

112
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,500
meme than reality much more reasonable

113
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,720
productive and beneficial is getting

114
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,760
sunlight on your skin in general and

115
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,680
this becomes doubly important in the

116
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
winter or cloudy days and the science is

117
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
very clear on this this literally

118
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,780
increases your testosterone it's going

119
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,340
to increase your size of your balls and

120
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,840
it's going to increase sex drive this

121
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,340
has been shown there's no debate about

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,080
it so you might be asking should I take

123
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,280
a vitamin D supplement instead of

124
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,900
getting sunlight the answer is no

125
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,340
sunlight is definitely the superior

126
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,680
method and on top of that most

127
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,440
supplements are ethyl most supplements

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,940
have piss poor quality control and they

129
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,739
aren't even absorbed by the body half

130
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,180
the time so I don't take supplements in

131
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,680
pill form most of the time there are

132
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,780
some good ones yes but I don't usually

133
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,879
consume a lot of like pill-based

134
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,380
supplements I will consume cod liver oil

135
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,820
for vitamin D especially in the cold

136
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,260
winter months or even if it's really

137
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,959
cloudy or something like that but even

138
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,000
here there's pitfalls so most fish are

139
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,680
polluted because the micro Plastics that

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,540
we consume end up in the ocean and they

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,699
poison the fish and if we get cod liver

142
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,620
oil from the fish then that cod liver

143
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,960
oil contains microplastics however

144
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,520
there's some small good brands out there

145
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,979
which are making quality stuff which are

146
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,380
free of these toxins I personally use a

147
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,180
fermented cod liver oil plus butter oil

148
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,500
blend very interesting product worth

149
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,360
checking out I'll put the link in the

150
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,919
description but don't let that fool you

151
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,300
just because there are some good

152
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,280
supplements out there they're not better

153
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,900
than the sun you still need sunlight as

154
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,460
much as you can get especially when it

155
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,600
gets cold and it is cloudy and now I'm

156
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,800
going to show you how to power up your

157
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,240
sun exposure with something called

158
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,860
double breathing now this is something

159
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,540
you can do anytime I want you to do this

160
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,979
right now and tell me how how it feels

161
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
what you do is you take your hands Place

162
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,639
one on your belly and one on your chest

163
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,080
and you're going to do a double breathe

164
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,639
so you're going to take air into your

165
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,660
belly and then your chest and then

166
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,960
you're going to breathe it out so it's

167
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,960
like this

168
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,880
so I notice what I did I took two breads

169
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,979
essentially I took into my belly

170
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,680
into my chest

171
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,180
out so it's one

172
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,180
one two

173
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
three

174
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,880
try this right now try this right now

175
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,699
and tell me you don't feel better

176
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,380
already that's because breath is the

177
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,060
interface between your subconscious and

178
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,680
your conscious mind why is that it's

179
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,300
because there's many parts of your body

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,979
that you have willful control over like

181
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,240
my hands the only way I can control my

182
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,560
hand is by actually thinking about it

183
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,820
and moving it there's also other parts

184
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,199
of your body like your digestive system

185
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,639
which you don't really think about you

186
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,380
there's no way to control your digestive

187
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,940
system by thinking about it but the

188
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,139
breath is interesting because most of

189
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,060
the day you're breathing without really

190
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,800
thinking about it it's subconscious but

191
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,180
you can do it you can think of your

192
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,860
breath and breathe manually right so

193
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,960
breath is interesting because it's both

194
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,419
involuntary and voluntary it's

195
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,340
subconscious and it's conscious so it's

196
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,440
the bridge between the subconscious and

197
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,479
conscious mind so you can use the breath

198
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,860
in a way as a communication device you

199
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,139
can use it to communicate with your

200
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,479
subconscious and to tell it to de-stress

201
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,639
and be in a rest and relaxed mode and at

202
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,900
the same time you can even amp it up so

203
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,660
you can use something like Wim Hof

204
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,520
method and boost up your body using the

205
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,600
breath also but that's not what I want

206
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,100
to do in the morning though that's

207
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,860
something worth trying as well for me

208
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,660
what I I want is Extreme Clarity and

209
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,220
relaxation in the morning that's what

210
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,840
helps me be more productive that being

211
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,100
said if you're going to do exercise or

212
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,479
Sports early in the morning perhaps you

213
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,979
want to actually get amped up and not

214
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,180
relaxed maybe you want to do the Wim Hof

215
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,560
method rather than the breathing which I

216
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,819
showed you really depends on what you're

217
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,660
trying to achieve in the morning if

218
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,419
you're going to exert yourself

219
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,280
physically Wim Hof method if you are

220
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,840
going to exert yourself mentally use the

221
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,639
esoteric double breathing method so

222
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,440
you're doing this double breathing as

223
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
you're gazing towards the sun you're not

224
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,039
looking literally at the sun don't be

225
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,900
dumb right so what you do is you gaze in

226
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,759
the direction of the Sun but not at the

227
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,199
Sun as you're taking these deep breaths

228
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,199
and resetting your nervous system

229
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,120
ideally you're doing this bare feet on

230
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,400
the grass and think about it when is the

231
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,020
last time you step Barefoot on the

232
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,300
ground or Barefoot on grass in general

233
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,160
it's kind of sad isn't it it's probably

234
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,800
like since your childhood you barely

235
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,039
step on grass Barefoot barely step on

236
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,319
Sand Barefoot barely step on soil or

237
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,060
actual forest floor Barefoot do you even

238
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,860
remember what it feels like to have

239
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,380
anything but shoes on when you step

240
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,360
outside this is not normal your feet are

241
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,099
actually very sensitive organs we were

242
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,020
evolved to collect valuable data about

243
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,639
our surroundings from the base of our

244
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,440
feet so stepping out into the soil

245
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,840
stepping out into nature with your socks

246
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,039
and shoes off is a great way to kick

247
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,539
start your nervous system in the morning

248
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,680
so the first thing you do after of

249
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,819
course you go to the bathroom in the

250
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,800
morning first thing you do is getting

251
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,419
the sun exposure ideally standing on the

252
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
grass and doing the double breathing and

253
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,020
then you tell me how you crush the day

254
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,840
with just implementing this one practice

255
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,000
we spend way too much time indoors think

256
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,620
about it in ancient times if you were

257
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,060
the guy who's going outside and hunting

258
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,979
and Gathering Etc and you know there's

259
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,780
this one guy who just sits in the cave

260
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,520
all day you would think he's some kind

261
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,780
of weirdo right there's a reason if you

262
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,340
have a pet if you have a pet dog

263
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,680
especially you'll know this for a fact

264
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,660
in the morning dogs seek out the Sun

265
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,160
Animals instinctively know how to do

266
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,900
this it's just we humans who need to

267
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,120
relearn these ancient practices there's

268
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,979
a reason why all ancient cultures

269
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,599
worship the sun in one form or other

270
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,699
think about what the sun is the sun is

271
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,740
literally a billion nuclear warheads

272
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,120
going off every single second by

273
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,440
stepping out in this sun and getting

274
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,360
recharged by the sun you're literally

275
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,219
running on nuclear fuel right now use

276
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,560
that power and conquer the day I'm going

277
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,300
to give you the raw tier esoteric

278
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
morning routine so that you can conquer

279
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,419
the day I'm going to make it simplified

280
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,800
so that you aren't spending like half

281
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,180
the day doing freaking morning routine

282
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,520
and you don't actually get any work done

283
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,959
only the essentials will survive in

284
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,060
disgust and what about sunscreen our

285
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,680
sunscreens bad well most of them are

286
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,320
most of them are toxic most of them

287
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,700
contain endocrine disruptors but not all

288
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,140
of them are bad so make sure you know

289
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,399
what you're getting so after you get

290
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,920
yourself an exposure what do you do you

291
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,360
need to replenish your electrolytes and

292
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll show you how to make the esoteric

293
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,260
morning Elixir so should you have

294
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,300
caffeine should you have coffee well you

295
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,920
can but only after 90 minutes after

296
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,080
waking up why because in the morning

297
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,700
your brain still has an accumulation of

298
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,380
sleep chemicals in it which is natural

299
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,360
and it's fine and your brain has

300
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,100
processes to purge these but if you

301
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
drink caffeine it disrupts those

302
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,420
processes and you get a low energy crash

303
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,920
later in the day cold showers is that

304
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,440
just a meme or does it work it actually

305
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,660
actually does so cold showers will boost

306
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,300
your Baseline dopamine for like six

307
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,800
hours very very beneficial to get a

308
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,420
massive amount of work done but you

309
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,860
might be asking like how do you actually

310
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,660
do it how do you actually get the cold

311
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,640
shower done this is what I do it's work

312
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,100
for me you step into your shower and you

313
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,600
take 30 deep breaths I'm not asking you

314
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
to hyperventilate I'm not asking you to

315
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,440
do Wim Hof method I'm just saying you

316
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,940
take 30 deep breaths and you have a

317
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,820
thing in your mind you have a promise to

318
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,080
yourself that at breath number 30 you're

319
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,760
going to crank the valve you're gonna

320
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,560
crank the thing and the shower head is

321
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,899
going to pour water on you at that point

322
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,580
so I'll do my 30 breaths I'll go as slow

323
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,940
as possible because I don't want to get

324
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,100
hit by the water but at bet number 30 is

325
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,019
done I crank the valve the shower water

326
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,000
hits me and for maybe one or two seconds

327
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,800
is uncomfortable but after that the

328
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,959
endorphins kick in the dopamine kicks in

329
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,760
and you actually feel really really good

330
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,740
and here's the interesting thing cold

331
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,620
showers actually warm you up it's

332
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,180
paradoxical so your brain feels the cold

333
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,279
and then freaks out and releases

334
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,360
adrenaline and heats up your body which

335
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,920
is actually something which you really

336
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,080
really want early in the morning that

337
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
body temperature increase plus the

338
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,140
cortisol spike is going to sink your

339
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
clocks perfectly and you're going to

340
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,080
have an amazing day and in fact you're

341
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,360
going to improve the quality of your

342
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,700
life overall after this I'll use a Neti

343
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,040
Pot which is a nasal irrigation device

344
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,140
it passes water to one nostril and now

345
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,700
the other and helps you essentially

346
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,740
clear up your Airways and have better

347
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,540
breathing I go more into depth in this

348
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,560
in my breathing esoteric guide so you

349
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,899
can check that out if you need to and

350
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,880
then it's time to work 90 minutes heavy

351
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,220
work session I will take the most

352
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,140
difficult challenging dreaded job and

353
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,279
smash it out in the first 90 minutes of

354
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,260
the day because that's going to give you

355
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,519
another increase in Baseline dopamine

356
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,899
and that's going to make you even more

357
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,220
productive during the day if instead

358
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,079
you're doing these low level tasks which

359
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,760
don't actually need any hardcore brain

360
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,980
and focus then you're kind of wasting

361
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,360
the benefits of this ritual so think

362
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,860
about what you did you have that

363
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,420
cortisol Spike you have the dopamine

364
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,339
Spike you had the testosterone boost you

365
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,500
have all these chemicals urging you to

366
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,899
do the most difficult work you should of

367
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,339
course use these benefits to smash out

368
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,200
the most difficult work why would you

369
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,060
waste it in a low level task right so

370
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,620
smash out the most challenging thing

371
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,720
that you want to do that day you've

372
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,000
already won if you literally do just

373
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,920
that one heavy task every day you're

374
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,079
already a million leagues ahead of the

375
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,579
average person and then you have the

376
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,560
rest of the day to conquer think about

377
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,240
that it gives you it gives you such a

378
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,579
massive Advantage your head and

379
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,100
shoulders above your average peers this

380
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,480
is the ultimate asymmetric Advantage if

381
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,860
you know how to use it right so when

382
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,959
should you sleep and when should you

383
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,240
wake up according to like the scientific

384
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,220
principles and whatnot 10 pm is the

385
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,079
ideal time to sleep but I've

386
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,339
experimented personally right and this

387
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,579
is going to be different for everybody

388
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,860
because science works on averages and

389
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,279
for whatever reason I don't get to sleep

390
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,720
very well at 10 pm for me midnight is a

391
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,320
perfect time to sleep and I naturally

392
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,880
wake up fully refreshed at 8 to 8 30 a.m

393
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,100
in the morning so while science is

394
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,140
amazing Baseline guide for understanding

395
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,279
what is true much more valuable for your

396
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,380
health is actually personal

397
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,480
experimentation and then do you use an

398
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,980
alarm well I do not use an alarm I wake

399
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
up whenever my body is refreshed and

400
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,000
ready to go but I understand that you

401
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
may have to use an alarm because you

402
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,140
have school or work in which case it is

403
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,300
what it is it's not ideal because sleep

404
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,760
happens in cycles and the alarm might

405
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,260
break the cycle at any point right so I

406
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,660
don't use an alarm so that I wake up

407
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,760
when my body is best suited to waking up

408
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,940
I will give you a powerful tool it's

409
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,160
called nsdr non-sleep deep rest let's

410
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,660
like the modern scientific name but the

411
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,339
ancient name for it because it is an

412
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,680
ancient practice 10 000 years old

413
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,540
practice called Yoga Nidra and it's kind

414
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,480
of a guided meditation type thing I have

415
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,100
made one of my own like I have made a

416
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,779
guide for it and I will link that in the

417
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,920
description what this does for you is as

418
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,300
you're going about the day you might

419
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,100
feel tired you might feel your dopamine

420
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,260
level is coming down that's normal it's

421
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,660
expected especially afternoon like 1 pm

422
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,820
2 p.m you're gonna have a crash in

423
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,800
energy that's fine that's normal but in

424
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,600
order to restore yourself you can of

425
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,100
course get a afternoon sleep that's fine

426
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,139
but if you don't have the time for it

427
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,820
nsdr is the way to go it takes about 15

428
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,620
minutes or less and it recharges your

429
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,720
dopamine recharges your energy levels

430
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,100
refresh measures your nervous system and

431
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,300
you can conquer the rest of the day so

432
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,620
check that out you can actually do that

433
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,139
anytime whenever you're feeling a little

434
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,820
bit drowsy a little bit sleepy nsdr is a

435
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,720
tool for you and for accountability this

436
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,459
is what you're going to do tomorrow

437
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
morning you're going to follow this

438
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,240
morning routine you're going to do it

439
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,380
correctly and smash out an important

440
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,700
piece of work you're going to get your

441
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,160
sun exposure and you're going to come

442
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,899
back to this video and type in all caps

443
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,760
praise the sun I want to know how many

444
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,200
people actually took any action based on

445
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,600
this video and if you didn't do it

446
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,220
you've got to type I am a cave dweller

447
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,540
keep yourself accountable none of this

448
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,860
knowledge is useful unless you actually

449
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,940
take action now I'm going to guide you

450
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,459
through a visualization that's going to

451
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,519
make it 110 more likely you actually

452
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,380
follow through you went to bed at 10 pm

453
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,700
after a super productive day's work

454
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,980
you're getting so close to your

455
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,660
financial goals you basically have the

456
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,360
money in the bank you wake up feeling

457
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,220
like this literal engine revving in your

458
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,899
heart you woke up even before the alarm

459
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,459
rang you powered your phone down

460
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,680
yesterday night and it's going to remain

461
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,720
powered down until your entire morning

462
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,639
routine is complete you go to the

463
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,740
bathroom you stop at the kitchen to make

464
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,200
your esoteric electrolyte drink then you

465
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,300
step outside into the crisp morning air

466
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,220
might be a little cold but the sun rays

467
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,779
are warming your face your eyes are

468
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,060
adjusting to the brightness you take

469
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,100
some nice deep breaths as you sip your

470
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,560
electrolyte you feel a sense of calm

471
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,820
from the breathing but also a surge of

472
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,680
energy from the electrolyte in the

473
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,720
sunlight you go back into your home open

474
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,459
up the windows stretch out your muscles

475
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,139
or if you're feeling really esoteric you

476
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,639
do your stretching routine Under the Sun

477
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,860
and then you get ready for your cold

478
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,360
shower like every day you feel a bit of

479
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,820
hesitation but you've been there before

480
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,040
and you know that the anticipation is

481
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,600
the painful part the shower itself is

482
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,100
actually quite refreshing after the cold

483
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,019
shower you feel your core temperature

484
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,220
rising you know the corn salt kick is

485
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,380
happening right now in your body

486
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,420
literally give you superpowers over the

487
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,760
average cave dweller and then you

488
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,560
approach the first task of the day you

489
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,779
know you'll emerge Victorious for in

490
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,579
your mind you have already triumphed the

491
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,100
morning is not something that happens to

492
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:25,220
you it's something that you do seize the

493
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,220
day
