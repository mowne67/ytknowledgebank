1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,279
a good life is a sequence of days well-

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,960
lived and a bad life is a sequence of

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,320
days wasted it seems like everybody

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,320
especially nowadays has all these clear

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,160
goals that they're striving towards but

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,599
you don't have that Clarity well this

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,920
video has exactly one objective you will

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,039
gain Clarity over your goals and be able

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
to define the steps needed to achieve

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,359
these people talk about the circle of

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,960
life but it's not a circle it's a

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,119
triangle health wealth and relationships

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,000
The Big Three human priorities The Big

14
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,160
Three rule on health is exercise

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
nutrition and Recovery the big three on

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,360
relationships is family friends and

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,280
female attraction the big three on

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,440
wealth is income investment and spending

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,440
it's literally that simple you can solve

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,640
exercise nutrition and Recovery you have

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,520
solved Health if you solved family

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,760
friends and female attraction you have

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,120
solved relationships if you've solved

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,440
income investment and spending you've

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,640
solved wealth that's literally it the

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,160
entire breakdown of the big three human

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,519
priorities now how can you convert this

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
framework into action it's always the

29
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,720
catch the simple answer is stop wasting

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,320
your time I am not speaking of

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,920
productivity a life is not wasted in one

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,040
day it is wasted and pissed away in

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,360
weeks and months and years I was pissing

34
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,400
my life away for years cleaning test

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,560
tubes in a biolab so trust me when I say

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,200
I know what confusion stagnation and

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
lack of identity feel like but today I

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
have the ability to travel anywhere I

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
please make money as a writer and meet

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,119
the kind of people who lift me up if you

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,320
mentally lock in to this video you will

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,280
unlock certain schemas which will help

43
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,560
you carve out the lifestyle you want and

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,320
ReDiscover the identity you truly have

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,399
so that when you are alone you are not

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,240
left thinking of what could have been

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,119
the first schema I'll give you right now

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
it is to stop thinking about the dream

49
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,759
life rather to think of the dream

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,520
lifestyle I've found it much easier to

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,719
solve for a good lifestyle than it is

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,079
for a good life the reason because the

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,000
concept of life is just it just has too

54
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,840
much baggage every religion or

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,239
philosophy has something to say to the

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,200
point at which I find it too hard to

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,160
take any action I found it much easier

58
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,879
to visualize the kind of Lifestyle I

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
want to have and it's much easier to

60
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,360
Define it's much easier to take action

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,360
towards this in the pursuit of this

62
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,440
dream lifestyle I found that I met

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,280
amazing people I've experienced the

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,239
stories that are the ingredients for a

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,280
good life but first I have a quick

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,959
disclaimer I'm not interested in

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,640
entertaining you or even educating you

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm only interested in outcomes you will

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,680
acquire practical tools and schemas I

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
will give you context to these schemas

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,959
using real life stories I do this

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
because this is the way our brain

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,159
encodes information stories matter they

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
reprogram your brain before we start

75
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,080
we're going to do the huberman saai a

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,000
breathing technique that will help you

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,519
retain the information in this video

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
twice as better let's take a quick

79
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,200
double inhale and then let it out so

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
it's like

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,840
this so notice what I'm doing right it's

82
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,280
a belly breath a chest

83
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,560
breath and then let it out so let's do

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,560
this

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,640
together most people don't know that

86
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,920
finding Clarity building structure and

87
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,400
gaining momentum is a process not an

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,360
event it is an ongoing project that

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
every successful man in history has had

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,799
to learn and practice the goal of this

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,879
video is to get there faster in Winter

92
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,799
2017 my job was cleaning test tubes I

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,239
spent entire days transferring frog

94
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,400
cells from a cotton swab into a

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,959
centrifuge tube I was doing this all day

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,519
four weeks four months even and I was in

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,959
graduate school I was making less than

98
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,920
minimum wage and in the winter there

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,159
were entire weeks that I didn't see the

100
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,319
sun because I had to get the lab before

101
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,280
the sun rose and I would leave only once

102
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,200
the sun had set even though all all this

103
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,959
would have been worth it if I was

104
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,760
actually succeeding and I wasn't I loved

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,799
biology that was the reason I was in the

106
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,439
PHD program I'd worked myself into this

107
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,079
lab that studies human lineages using

108
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,959
gws it's um it's kind of like K3 and me

109
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,359
or ancestry.com but it forms the basis

110
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,600
for those website essentially we had

111
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,639
these weekly meetings every Thursday at

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,560
400 p.m. and I I hated them I used to

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,560
dread them I used to dread them because

114
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,440
well well my posture used to change and

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,600
go from the triumphant Lobster to the

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,919
defeated Lobster as I got crushed every

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,440
week I couldn't perform in this

118
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,160
environment because one I didn't have

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
Clarity I didn't see a connection

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,039
between my day-to-day activities and my

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,479
dreams I didn't have structure because

122
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,680
in a PhD program you don't have

123
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,240
structure almost no classes exams or

124
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
assignments you're just kind of left to

125
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,840
figure it out third I didn't have

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,360
momentum because I didn't have a sense

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,479
of growth research isn't linear half the

128
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,400
time you feel like you're moving

129
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,240
backwards or sideways as competing with

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,479
these fat neck beard nerds and these

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,120
neurotic females for a position that was

132
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,199
kept at the six figures low six figures

133
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,479
I remember thinking even if I win this I

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,800
still lose and this was when I made the

135
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,759
decision that would change my life

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,960
forever I hit the emergency button I

137
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,160
decided to join the Army there's this

138
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,160
silly saying which is not true but it's

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,199
it's funny

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,360
they say that when a woman hits Rock

141
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,720
Bottom she becomes a stripper when a man

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,720
hits Rock Bottom he joins the Army well

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
for me this was my chance this was my I

144
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,280
was going to go and transform in the

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,199
Army I quit the program the next day I

146
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,880
sent two emails and had two

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,280
conversations in a total of 20 minutes I

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,240
had burned years of Goodwill and years

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,000
of progress I was so sick of living this

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,919
life that I was conditioned into I

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,680
didn't know what I wanted but I knew

152
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,479
that I wanted CL I wanted structure I

153
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,240
wanted momentum I wanted to be people I

154
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,720
wanted to be around people I liked and

155
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,720
respected I wanted to restart reset and

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,080
reboot I felt that joining the Army was

157
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,039
the best way to get this though of

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,960
course I was naive at the time I

159
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,960
finished out my masters in biology and

160
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,560
got on a flight to Ford Benning Georgia

161
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,560
to be a part of the US Army infantry I

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
shared the story to show you that you

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
are only ever one decision away from

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,599
changing your life forever now this is

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,720
not advice I'm not suggesting you follow

166
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,840
the road that I took I think army

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,960
training was valuable to me but it was

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,720
also an absolute train wreck it was

169
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,560
beyond [ __ ] the Army had the chance

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,000
to mold confused boys into disciplined

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,919
and motivated men but it fails at that

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
mission every single day there are

173
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,880
absolutely some amazing drill sergeants

174
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,120
out there who serve as an inspiration

175
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,759
but the program as a whole was stupid

176
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,360
still leaves a bad taste in my mouth to

177
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
think of it not because the program was

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,520
too difficult which would have been fine

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,599
which have been cool actually but

180
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,919
because the Army made zero effort at

181
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,639
actually building up its Personnel the

182
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,840
actual tactical training like with

183
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,479
weapons training like using I don't know

184
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,120
using the Claymore or m4s whatever

185
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,479
equipment that we were using that was

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,039
actually cool but you may not believe

187
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,560
this I swear this is true my platoon

188
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,560
performed better on week 2 than it did

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,720
on week 20 we went for eager and ready

190
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,319
to learn and grow and work as a team to

191
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,639
just counting the days to get out it was

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,360
stupid man despite all this I succeeded

193
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,199
in using these months as a training

194
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,560
opportunity for myself I used it as a

195
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,440
golden opportunity for transformation I

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,720
had Clarity we as a platoon knew our

197
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,800
purpose we wanted to earn the crossed

198
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,759
rifles of the Infantry we wanted to earn

199
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,360
the blue cord and get the [ __ ] out of

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,159
Ford Benning I handly had structure as

201
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,879
well the drill sergeant told you when to

202
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,319
wake up they told you what to eat they

203
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,599
told you when to sleep you didn't have

204
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,840
any choices you only had four sets of

205
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,560
ocp pattern camo to choose from there

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,560
was no clothing to choose I even had

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
momentum I was able to rock longer

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,440
distances my pain tolerance and overall

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,599
ability to manage stress was clearly

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,400
improving I finally had a group of guys

211
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,560
around me though I didn't like all of

212
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,159
them they still made the same sacrifices

213
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,520
that I did I finally had time to think

214
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,240
through my limiting beliefs deprogram my

215
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,280
conditioning and detach from the friends

216
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,680
and family who are keeping me stuck in

217
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,759
the identity that I had in the past as a

218
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,919
direct result of this introspection I

219
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,159
started my YouTube channel and the

220
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,440
business that supports it for me I just

221
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,719
wanted the freedom to travel read books

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
go to museums play video games have

223
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,120
coffee at nice cafes meet interesting

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,000
people support my family and build cool

225
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,320
stuff with my team I don't want to worry

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,959
about gas prices inflation and grocery

227
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,279
bills I can say without a doubt that

228
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,959
going through the Infantry training

229
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,600
pipeline was a pivotal journey in my

230
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,720
life during this army training I

231
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,200
maintained a series of three black

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,760
journals years ago I had journaled about

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,600
the lifestyle I wanted I wanted to live

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,079
the beach life in a tropical refugium I

235
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,120
live in Hawaii one of the most beautiful

236
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,920
places and is and is home to one of the

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
most beautiful beaches on the planet I

238
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,079
wanted to travel the world to live and

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,680
meet guys who are on the same path of

240
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,120
asent as I was I spent the last month at

241
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,000
turkey with five amazing entrepreneurs

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,760
every lunch and dinner we had was

243
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,160
something that I would look forward to

244
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,600
we had a private Chef who cooked up

245
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,600
these amazing meals every day every

246
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,480
conversation we had led to new ideas

247
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,160
that I could use in running Crusade none

248
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,959
of this is Magic or manifestation all

249
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,680
comes down to cause and effect every

250
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,440
project small or large was nothing more

251
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
than an idea in a man's head if you're

252
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,920
living a lifestyle that you are not

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,440
satisfied with it may not be your fault

254
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,079
but it is your problem you will now

255
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,959
learn the exact schema to impose Clarity

256
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,920
on reality it is said that the goddess

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,079
Fortuna responds only to Men of strong

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,839
will and clear mind now you are going to

259
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,760
receive the actionable steps I'm going

260
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,640
to give you an exercise to do grab a

261
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,680
sheet of paper and divide it into two

262
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,440
halves if you're driving or otherwise

263
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,560
unable to do this at this time that's

264
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,040
fine just do it later the First Column

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,320
should be titled a normal day in one

266
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,480
year's time the second column is titled

267
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,079
sacrifices if you do not sacrifice for

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,920
your dreams your dreams become the

269
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,120
sacrifice this is going to be a key

270
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,399
learning so pay attention since ancient

271
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,440
times sacrifice has always been

272
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,800
important the ancient Greeks believed in

273
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,360
animal sacrifice and burnt offerings

274
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,639
they were not unique in this belief the

275
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,360
empires of Central America and the VC

276
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,480
kingdoms are just two easy examples that

277
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,519
come to my mind the carthaginians

278
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,639
sacrificed their own children to their

279
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,600
demon god Bal hamon until the Roman

280
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,360
Legions of course brought the fires of

281
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Retribution and Vengeance to their

282
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,639
cursed City but sacrifice was never just

283
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,519
a matter of Slaughter even a butcher

284
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,959
could do Slaughter you had to perform

285
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,440
the sacrifice with specific details you

286
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,279
need to sacrifice a Bull of the right

287
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,320
color and quantity you needed the

288
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,360
sacrifice to be conducted by a priest of

289
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
sufficient power you needed the right

290
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,440
time of day you needed the right

291
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,800
direction of the wind you needed the

292
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,959
right phase of the moon if you didn't do

293
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,720
this right the gods wouldn't listen and

294
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,079
worse they would be offended now we

295
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,000
don't believe in this kind of sacrifice

296
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,279
anymore but the specificity of the

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,560
sacrifice this aspect is important

298
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,560
sacrifice is a trainable skill and this

299
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,480
video will provide you the basics you

300
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,600
have these two columns in front of you a

301
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,399
normal day in one year's time and

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,440
sacrifice under a normal day you will

303
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,480
write out a narrative From Dusk to Dawn

304
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,200
of a normal day in your life one year

305
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,800
from now from your perspective visualize

306
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,880
the details in your mind's eye and carry

307
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,880
it onto paper make sure it is so

308
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,720
beautiful that it hurts that you aren't

309
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,480
living that way right now I know there

310
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,160
are some of you who will be skeptical of

311
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,320
something like this You' say

312
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,000
visualization doesn't work hear me out

313
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
I'd like to show you a visualization

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
board that I created years ago you can

315
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,399
actually see the time stamps you'll see

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,680
beaches pineapples and volcanoes you'll

317
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
see food and drink with friends some

318
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,959
things are still pending like going on a

319
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,800
sailing Expedition and some goals have

320
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,360
changed for example I'm no longer

321
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,600
interested in the Porsche i' would

322
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,720
rather get a spec out Land Cruiser the

323
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,519
point is years ago I had added these

324
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,079
pictures as a collage describing my

325
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,240
dream life and now I live in Hawaii

326
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,320
which has guess what pineapples

327
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,279
volcanoes and beaches I never thought I

328
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,680
would live in Hawaii I had no opinions

329
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,240
one way or other as to where I wanted to

330
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,880
live it just so happened because that is

331
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,160
what I primed my mind to seek here's the

332
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,920
key learning you have to build castles

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
in the clouds before you can build them

334
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,600
on land even craus chaler was just a

335
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,079
vision a scribble on paper before it

336
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,279
became the Fortress Monastery of the

337
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,160
knights hospitaler so I take my vision

338
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,279
very seriously here are some questions

339
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,839
to get you started pause to Think

340
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,920
Through each of these before you answer

341
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,920
where do you live who do you live with

342
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,959
what's the weather like where you live

343
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,079
what time do you wake up do you have an

344
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,959
alarm clock do you make coffee or go to

345
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,480
a cafe when do you start working what

346
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,519
kind of work is it that you do how much

347
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,120
money do you make per month how much

348
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,800
money do you have in savings is there a

349
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,600
woman in your life what is she like do

350
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,839
you have pets do you have kids what does

351
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,360
your dream physique look like there are

352
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,920
no right or wrong answers to any of

353
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,920
these questions and if you have more

354
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,839
details and more questions that's a good

355
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,120
sign it means your imagination is acting

356
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
and in answering these questions for

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
yourself you are training your

358
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,800
visualization you're essentially

359
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,199
training your ability to set goals and

360
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,240
that is the step one in actually hitting

361
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:52,839
those goals the only way you can mess

362
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,320
this exercise Up Is by regurgitating The

363
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,600
Dream Life you heard from somebody else

364
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,399
if you talk about getting a Russian

365
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,759
girlfriend and living in Bali because h

366
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,440
said so you're wrong if you talk about

367
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,079
Bugattis and bimbos cuz Tate said so

368
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,639
you're wrong if you want to start a

369
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,480
school Community because horoi said so

370
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,560
you're wrong right until something

371
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,800
resonates with you another way you can

372
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,320
do this exercise wrong is by thinking

373
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,040
small if your vision doesn't intimidate

374
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,079
you slightly you're wrong people

375
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,440
overestimate what they can do in a day

376
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,800
but underestimate what they can do in a

377
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,880
year if you're actually locked in if you

378
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,079
actually had clarity structure and

379
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,720
momentum what could you do here's the

380
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,399
dream lifestyle I Envision for myself I

381
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,279
share this as an example one year from

382
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,880
now I'll live in Rome the Eternal City

383
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,440
I'll host a growth house in the city

384
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,839
similar to the one I hosted in Austin

385
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,959
Texas I'll spend time with guys who have

386
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,680
a similar level of experience of life

387
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,959
and business as me I'll get gelato every

388
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,079
day I'll go to the gym with the boys and

389
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,480
spend 10 to 20% of my income this is

390
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,399
important for me I'll spend 10 to 20% of

391
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,759
my income on being a patron of the Arts

392
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,519
I will commission artwork from real

393
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,440
human artists I will commission music

394
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,639
from real human artists I will increase

395
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,360
the beauty of the society I live in and

396
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,360
use these artworks and music pieces as a

397
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,720
part of my business I will show the

398
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,480
world what it means by the term business

399
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,279
as art I will treat my body as art after

400
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,160
surgery I'm finally able to rebuild I

401
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,399
will never take my breathing for granted

402
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,880
again I will Forge the Bronze Age

403
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,440
physique I don't want you to copy my

404
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,360
vision but if there are aspects of that

405
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,240
that resonate with you then you should

406
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,720
take them to be your own spend time on

407
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,040
this assignment any time that you spend

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,399
building your mind which is your primary

409
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,600
asset cannot be possibly spent in Wayne

410
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,360
the invisible work that we do today will

411
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,000
have visible results tomorrow results

412
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,600
comes from vision and action but action

413
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,920
isn't just the things we do it's Alo the

414
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,839
things that we choose not to do there

415
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,120
are no Solutions only tradeoffs this

416
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,399
means that to get closer to your goals

417
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,079
there are some things that you will need

418
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,199
to trade off when I sacrifice my fear of

419
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,279
being on camera I was able to grow a

420
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,680
personal brand that allows me to do work

421
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,279
that I find meaningful here's the thing

422
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,000
you cannot avoid sacrifice you can only

423
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,000
choose what sacrifices to make I will

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
share mine again as an example so you

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,519
have an idea of what it looks like here

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,839
are my sacrifices for the year of 2025

427
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,440
first I will make sacrifice of sweat and

428
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,759
toil in the temple of iron until I learn

429
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,000
to love it I will rebuild my body and

430
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,680
Purge the weakness for my body I'll use

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,279
my knowledge of biology to forge steal

432
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,480
second I will make sacrifice of money I

433
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,560
will go broke investing in myself I will

434
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,639
retain an emergency fund but other than

435
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,199
that I will pour my money into myself

436
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,880
and my business which is of course an

437
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,839
extension of myself I will sacrifice the

438
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,680
fears and limiting beliefs that my

439
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,240
parents transferred on to me I will

440
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,839
spend a minimum

441
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,160
$330,000 in self- investment over the

442
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,919
year of 2025 third I will make sacrifice

443
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,360
of time to make more and better videos I

444
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,679
will spend the time to do real research

445
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,760
and real thinking instead of using chat

446
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,679
GPT like all the other YouTubers you may

447
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,880
not know this but for every minute of

448
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,600
published content you see on my channel

449
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,080
there was 1 hour of work in the back end

450
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,480
in research writing recording and

451
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,559
editing most YouTubers who talk about

452
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,000
health aren't actually reading the

453
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,440
research they're just regurgitating what

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,799
other YouTubers say or reading blogs

455
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,039
they're not actually going through the

456
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,640
research because first to be fair it's

457
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,559
this is not on them because a lot of

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,120
research is behind a pay wall fine but

459
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,720
the second it's kind of hard to read

460
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,160
research papers you need training to do

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,080
this at this time pause the video and

462
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,120
take the time to complete the exercise

463
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,240
with the actual specific sacrifices that

464
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,200
you are prepared to make the the more

465
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,360
specific the sacrifice and more

466
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,360
emotional resonance that it has with you

467
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,159
the better at this time you know what

468
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,640
you want and you know what forces you

469
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,280
want to commit to achieve those

470
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,360
objectives so if you don't make those

471
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,320
sacrifices you don't have the right to

472
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
be surprised when you don't meet your

473
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,679
goals the objective of this video was to

474
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
give you Clarity not Comfort if you take

475
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,240
away one thing from this video it should

476
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,000
be this if you don't sacrifice for your

477
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,799
dreams your dreams will become that

478
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,799
sacrifice
