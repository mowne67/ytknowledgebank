1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,279
reality punishes those who deny her and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,360
Fortune blesses those who act with

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,719
boldness and have the furthest Vision

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,480
having a good mental model for how the

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,280
world really works allows you to make

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,440
better decisions in real life and allows

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,800
you to see business opportunities when

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,960
others only see Darkness studying human

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,760
nature is the first step in creating a

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,000
personal brand so this collection of

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,720
books is not a theoretical collection it

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,400
is not for your reading pleasure this is

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,039
a series of very practical and

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
intelligent books these books are

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,600
designed to peel away the darkness

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
allowing you to see with more

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
understanding we've study human nature

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,079
and reality itself from the perspective

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
of History economics biology and

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,520
morality we'll start off with the book

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
The sovereign individual by the authors

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,120
Davidson and reys Mong this is a book

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
that predicts this book is full of

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,160
interesting predictions and if you look

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
up a online review of This Book You'll

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,600
see that people are amazed by the

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,920
prediction of such trival things as

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,800
smartphones and the gig economy these

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,280
are distractions these are not the key

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,960
predictions of this book you see most

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,960
non-fiction writers who write about the

32
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,880
future are often coward they'll shy away

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,360
from making predictions or if they do

34
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
make a prediction they'll cover it in

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,799
caveat so that the prediction itself is

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,479
without fangs without any skin in the

37
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,759
game but not so in this book the authors

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,079
are bold they go ahead and make what

39
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,600
they think is the best possible

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,799
prediction based on the knowledge and

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,360
information which they have and here's

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,119
the thing making predictions is risky

43
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,400
because if they come wrong then you look

44
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,600
like a fool so I have a lot of respect

45
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,880
for this book just for making those

46
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,240
predictions making them with boldness

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,079
and support their predictions with facts

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,600
and the actual logical structure which

49
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,840
leads them to make those conclusions the

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,119
real frightening prediction that the

51
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,200
book makes is regarding the fragility of

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,560
the nation state it says that the nation

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,439
state will always try to find itself in

54
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,040
a war because a war serves to better its

55
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,680
own interest even at the expense of the

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,000
citizens paying its taxes a nation state

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
according to the tenants of this book

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,360
will do anything to perpetuate a

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
pretense of holding power it goes so far

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,840
as to say that nation states will

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,520
encourage and forment War in order to

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
maintain their whole and happened just a

63
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,039
few years after the release of this book

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm not making the claim that was an

65
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,400
inside job more so what I'm saying is

66
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,680
was used by the nation state to gain a

67
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,599
level of tyrannical control over its

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
population marks the day the old ideals

69
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,160
of the United States die in the new

70
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,959
modern surveillance state was born do

71
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,800
you know what the Patriot Act is well

72
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,920
but that's a topic for a different video

73
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,840
hundreds of thousands of loyal

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,440
courageous and Brave Young Americans

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,920
were funneled into the wrong war in the

76
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,519
wrong country in order to perpetuate the

77
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,280
power of the nation state and these

78
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,720
young men they went and fought for what

79
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,800
purpose to enrich the Saudis to enrich

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,519
the bankers and investors to enrich the

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
weapons complex the book which was

82
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,480
written back in the 1990s actually

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,599
predicts this and says how the mega

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,440
political structures of the modern state

85
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,040
will incentivize this kind of behavior

86
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,760
and this book goes completely against

87
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,760
the status quo political thinking which

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,840
states that the nation state is the the

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,400
culmination the Apex of human political

90
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,200
achievement in fact Francis fukuyama who

91
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,879
I personally met as a very well-known

92
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,280
historian and political scientist

93
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,680
actually calls this the end of History

94
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,879
this book says no this is not the end of

95
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,080
history and terrible darkness and

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
potential hope lies in the near future

97
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,319
so is this book a perfect predictor of

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,959
the future absolutely not and the

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,319
authors don't claim that to be the case

100
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,400
in fact the first chapter of this book

101
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,519
is an utter flaw the first chapter goes

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
on into the whole year 2000 crisis thing

103
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,120
about the Y 2K bug which never really

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
materialized so no this book is not a

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,120
perfect predictor of History it's first

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,640
and foremost a book about mental models

107
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,239
how you can use observations and facts

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,720
and connect them in a logical faction to

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
make predictions about the future this

110
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,000
book is not the rambling of Mad Men this

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,200
is a very precise book which lays out

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
why the authors believe what they

113
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,879
believe and you can choose to reject

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
their logic or Embrace their logic

115
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,319
that's up to you the book does not hide

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
its internal working so the book's

117
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,599
titled the sovereign individual what

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,280
does this mean this refers to the idea

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,000
that in the future individuals will have

120
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,439
massive power which they never had

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,879
before and this book was written more

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,640
than 25 years ago and it's coming true

123
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,720
isn't it look at Joe Rogan for example

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,840
Joe Rogan has more loyalty and more

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,560
viewership than literal Legacy companies

126
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,320
of the past like CNN or MSNBC a single

127
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,520
man has more influence that a whole

128
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,680
media conglomerate this was not possible

129
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,840
20 years ago this was a prediction that

130
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,720
came true and now in our day almost

131
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,039
seems natural it seems normal but you

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,039
have to understand how remarkable This

133
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,160
truly is from a world which completely

134
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,880
revolved one this Mass organization and

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,639
an industrial society which only relied

136
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,680
on mass production we're going to a

137
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,840
different form of economy where

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,560
individuals are massively valued and

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,360
production of higher quality at a

140
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,759
smaller scale is becoming more of the

141
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,400
desired state but trust me when I tell

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,800
you this is not a book about hope this

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,880
book is not blind to human evil this

144
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,520
book predicts rivers of blood if you

145
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
were to look at what's going around the

146
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,199
globe right now you would say that those

147
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,199
rivers are already flowing this book is

148
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,080
of course about sovereignty so

149
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,560
sovereignty means the ability to have

150
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,720
the freedom and liberty to control their

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
own destiny a Sovereign Nation is

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
essentially a nation which is not a

153
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
slave to another Nation a sovereign

154
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,479
individual is an individual who is not a

155
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
slave to Any Nation so the norm the

156
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,000
common understanding of nationhood is

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,600
you're born into a country you're likely

158
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,759
going to live your entire lives in that

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
country pay taxes to the country then

160
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
die

161
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,160
there there's really no choice in the

162
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,319
matter but going forward what you find

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,960
is individuals have that choice highly

164
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,319
productive and talented individuals will

165
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,080
find that if they live in a country

166
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,680
which doesn't treat them right a country

167
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,120
which is taxing them too much or whose

168
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,919
government is standing for values which

169
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,039
they no longer stand for or is betraying

170
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,759
the citizens by going to meaningless war

171
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,520
and wasting their tax money all these

172
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,960
would be reasons for talented

173
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,800
individuals to say I'm out I'm going to

174
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,120
go where I'm treated best and this is

175
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,720
already happening and this is only going

176
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,160
to ACC accelerate more especially with

177
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,720
regards to another prediction which this

178
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,120
book makes this book predicts that a new

179
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,160
form of currency will arise a form of

180
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,639
currency that's immune to Taxation and

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
inflation by the government through

182
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,400
which individuals can carry out

183
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
transactions without the need for Fiat

184
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,759
and one could say that this currency has

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
arisen in the form of Bitcoin but

186
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,800
Bitcoin is a scam is it not the whole

187
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
crypto industry is a scam right well

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,479
this brings us to the second book on

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,720
this list the Bitcoin standard by saaden

190
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,479
a mood these are actually two books

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Bitcoin standard followed by Fiat

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,360
standard it's SQL but I just lumped them

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
together as one book because they really

194
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,440
tied together so I have to tell you this

195
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,440
that the Bitcoin standard is not about

196
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Bitcoin it is first and foremost about

197
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,240
the nature of currency about money

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,199
itself it helps you distinguish between

199
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
the difference between money currency

200
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,080
and wealth and this book was suggested

201
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,880
to me by a seven fig businessman by the

202
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,720
name of Robert Oliver very talented

203
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,879
individual and I'll link to his channel

204
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
in the description below so this book is

205
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,039
not a bought Bitcoin it is about the

206
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,520
nature of currency and help you answer

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,440
the question if the government can just

208
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,840
print how much of money it wants why

209
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,319
does it tax you so much it's honestly a

210
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,840
very scary and Sinister book in the

211
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,560
sense that it it shatters your beliefs

212
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,160
about how money works and how the world

213
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,440
actually works it shows how dark the

214
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,319
system really is it shows you how the

215
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,199
system of federal debt slavery truly is

216
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,720
and you've probably seen this statistic

217
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,479
that the world is trillions of dollars

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
in debt you know the US is billions of

219
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,560
dollars in debt whatever is death to

220
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
whom right that's a question which you

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
have to ask and this book does a

222
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,479
phenomenal job of answering it I will

223
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
probably make a whole video on this

224
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,199
topic it's fascinating and dark if you

225
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,160
want to get ahead of me and get a even

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,440
richer understanding strongly suggest

227
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,720
the Bitcoin standard and the Fiat

228
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,400
standard by saine AMU and indeed it

229
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
talks about how the US dollar is covered

230
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,120
in blood and gore and it talks about

231
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,319
that most Sinister of organizations the

232
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,599
Federal Reserve the book builds nicely

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
upon the foundations of the sovereign

234
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,120
individual these books work really

235
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,319
nicely together one was written back in

236
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
1990s and makes predictions about the

237
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,440
future and the Bitcoin standard is

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,240
written pretty recently and looks back

239
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,159
and talks about what recent changes have

240
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,879
happened so it kind of brings you up to

241
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,840
date and the Fiat standard was I think

242
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
released just last year so it's very

243
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,960
much up to date as to the technology of

244
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,240
money and makes predictions about how

245
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,280
we're going to look at this going

246
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,039
forward next 10 to 20 years but indeed

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,560
this book is first and foremost about

248
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,479
human nature like I promised it shows

249
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,720
you how the incentive structures created

250
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,200
by the miny system that we have truly

251
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,360
shape every aspect of society and you

252
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,680
know me I love to understand my history

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,279
and in my previous video about the Roman

254
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,800
Empire and its demise and what we can

255
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
learn from it I talk about the

256
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,519
debasement of currency I tell you that

257
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,160
debasement is essentially the old term

258
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,800
when you add base metals to gold in

259
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
order to water it down for the

260
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,440
government to create more money but

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,320
doesn't really create more money what it

262
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,320
really does is creates more Fiat token

263
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,839
the common term for this used by the

264
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,800
Gremlin verminous macroeconomists is

265
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,440
called quantitative easing and these

266
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,880
folk will tell you that a slight amount

267
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,120
of inflation is actually good for the

268
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,000
economy it it promotes business growth

269
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,079
it promotes investment but you know what

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,920
this is actually just marketing speak

271
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,200
imagine if they told you hey your tax as

272
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,920
a citizen is 40% but you know if we

273
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,839
increase the tax by another 10% it will

274
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,760
actually be good for the economy would

275
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,560
you believe them or would you start

276
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,360
drawing the pitchforks this book helps

277
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,440
you understand the truth behind the lies

278
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,760
it makes you understand why big business

279
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,160
big media and the government say the

280
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,079
things that they do it starts to make

281
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
sense for the first time and one could

282
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,399
excuse the Romans Dian didn't know

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
perhaps that the debasement of currency

284
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,279
would have such terrible Downstream

285
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,240
effects he didn't know perhaps that the

286
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,839
price ceilings that he enforced would be

287
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,079
calamitous but we do know it now we have

288
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,600
the data in place we understand how the

289
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,480
economy works we understand how

290
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,720
incentives structures work but that's

291
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
the thing the government's incentives

292
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,160
are not the same as a citizen incentive

293
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,839
and this is because of the nature of the

294
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,320
currency the nature of the currency fiat

295
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,079
currency is such that the government can

296
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,920
basically print how much it wants and

297
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,600
this touches everything even your food

298
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,720
quality so understand this this is

299
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,560
actually from the book the government's

300
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,440
ability to print money gives it the

301
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,320
ability to fix interest rates so what

302
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
the government did was it lowered

303
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,640
interest rates what does that mean it

304
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,360
allows businesses including fors to take

305
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,240
big loans why is this a bad thing this

306
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,160
is surely a good thing if farmers can

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,360
take loans they can probably produce

308
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,560
more food but this is a market

309
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,240
Distortion what I mean let me explain

310
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
really clearly right so when the

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,760
interest rates go low and big loans are

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,440
available for purchase the big farmers

313
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,959
can claim massive loans because they

314
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
already have a lot of capital and a lot

315
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,600
of assets which they use as collateral

316
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,839
and they use these massive loans to

317
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,560
scale up their operations to a crazy

318
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,760
level driving the prices extremely low

319
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,480
small farmers who cannot have access to

320
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,399
such big loans cannot do this and even

321
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,399
though their quality of produce might be

322
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,880
higher they're driven out of business

323
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,959
now all that's left in the economy are

324
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,680
these Mega farms and mega corporations

325
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
which are pumping out very very cheap

326
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,079
food but at the cost of nutritional

327
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,600
density so because of this Distortion in

328
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,760
the market now you have food which is

329
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,920
extremely cheap if the only thing you

330
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,920
meant by food was just calories so yes

331
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,800
in the United States calories are

332
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,240
extremely cheap but nutrition becomes

333
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,000
expensive in a natural economy this

334
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,320
shouldn't be the case you shouldn't have

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,320
calories going in One Direction and

336
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,600
nutrition going in the other direction

337
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,800
but because of the nature of government

338
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
subsidies enabled by the fact that the

339
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,399
government has Fiat money to print you

340
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,079
have this disgusting situation where

341
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,160
people are fat and they're obese but

342
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,600
they're obese and fat because they're

343
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,160
malnutritioned it's ridiculous this is a

344
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,160
clown World which is enabled by the

345
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,519
currency that we use so strongly suggest

346
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,720
reading this book to understand this at

347
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,560
a more granular level and indeed here's

348
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,279
the most Sinister part

349
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,600
the nature of our money system

350
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,639
determines the morality of society as a

351
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,120
whole why is this so savings right you

352
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,880
earn money cool you save it in your bank

353
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,519
account you expect the money to stay the

354
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,199
same because you put $10 in surely it

355
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,440
should stay $10 and in most of human

356
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,279
history Not only would it stay it would

357
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,639
actually increase but not in our

358
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,680
inflationary environment when you store

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,600
$10 the next day it's 9 the next day

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,560
it's 8 every day your value of money is

361
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,079
decreasing in your savings account so

362
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
what does this mean from an incentive

363
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,600
structure point of view what does it

364
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
mean according to human nature what it

365
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
means is if people believe that saving

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,480
is pointless because it is because of

367
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
the nature of the money then they're

368
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,440
more incentivized to spend in the

369
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,279
present instead of looking into the

370
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,519
future building Legacy instead of

371
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,639
planning 10 20 30 100 years into the

372
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,720
future people are forced to think hey

373
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,839
the money is not going to be worth

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,959
anything I might as well spend it the

375
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,040
monetary system incentivizes instant

376
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,519
gratification over delayed gratification

377
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,880
this is one source of degradation of

378
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,320
morality is just how we perceive time

379
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,000
and this neatly brings us to the topic

380
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,600
of morality and brings us to the next

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
book which is the Righteous Mind by

382
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,639
Jonathan hate and this is a truly

383
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,279
brilliant book it breaks down why humans

384
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,480
behave in the moral way that they do it

385
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,519
discusses moral decision- making and

386
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,519
this it does it in such a brilliant way

387
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,680
in a very simple and easy to understand

388
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,120
way they break down morality into five

389
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,920
pillars the pillars are care fairness

390
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,920
loyalty Authority and sanctity and it

391
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,399
turns out this explains why left leaning

392
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,440
folk and right leaning folk don't ever

393
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,199
succeed in talking to each other people

394
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,760
who lean left they only use two of these

395
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:50,639
pillars they only use care and they only

396
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,880
use fairness and the folk on the right

397
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
more conservative folk these guys use

398
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
all five pillars they use the first two

399
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,839
which I mentioned but they also look at

400
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
loyalty Authority and sanctity and this

401
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,639
book is critical because understanding

402
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,160
each other and having rational decisions

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,959
brings Society together and prevents a

404
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,160
division division is not helpful for us

405
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,360
as people division is only helpful for

406
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
the powers that be me personally I

407
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,440
definitely lean more conservative I

408
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,160
certainly do not mean I support the

409
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,360
conservative party those are two

410
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,240
different things trust me I just tend to

411
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
lean conservative in my value I care

412
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
about all these five pillars I care

413
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,759
about giving care to folk who need it I

414
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
care about fairness and Justice I care

415
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,600
about loyalty to the group I care about

416
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
deferring to Authority where it makes

417
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,880
sense and I care about the sanctity and

418
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,399
morals of the society but some of my

419
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,480
family members and friends they lean

420
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,680
left they reject the idea of morality

421
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,839
based on disgust and Purity the idea

422
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,440
that if it doesn't harm somebody else

423
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,079
then it's Justified to do while I

424
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,560
disagree with this at least I understand

425
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,880
their perspective and indeed this book

426
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,199
shows you basically a prediction of how

427
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,320
politics is progressing and shows you

428
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,199
how the divisions sewed into society are

429
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,079
the perfect Seam for manipulation cuz

430
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,680
these folk the politicians they

431
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,800
understand these tactics they understand

432
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,560
how to pull these levers of Morality In

433
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
order to make us do what they want so

434
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,680
you have to take control of your own

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,639
morality and have a deeper understanding

436
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,800
of why your moral intuition your moral

437
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,160
compass works the way it does so that

438
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,160
you are being manipulated by outside

439
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
forces my personal belief is that

440
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,120
disgust is a powerful piece of the moral

441
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,040
compass if I find something disgusting

442
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,880
happening in society something really

443
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,800
irritates me and disgusts me I don't

444
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,920
have to be sat there analyzing the moral

445
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,680
logic in order to find the objective or

446
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,240
subjective truth about morality in order

447
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,279
to reject it I believe if something's

448
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,519
disgusting that grounds enough for me to

449
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,040
reject it but regardless it is very

450
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
interesting that when people have so

451
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
many different views and beliefs and

452
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,279
moral structures that we can come

453
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,160
together as a society and even though

454
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,399
each individual has its own Survival at

455
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,480
its core even then we as human beings

456
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,399
can act in a tribe and this is not a

457
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,079
trivial point this requires explanation

458
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,319
and and this is where the final book The

459
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,680
Selfish Gene comes in this is the book

460
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:06,759
which literally coined the word me in

461
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,800
this book the author Dawkins literally

462
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,199
says we need a name for the new

463
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,000
replicator a noun that conveys the idea

464
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,160
of a unit of cultural transmission or a

465
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,360
unit of

466
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,040
imitation MIM comes from a suitable

467
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,240
Greek root but I want a monosyllable

468
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,519
that sounds a bit like genan I hope my

469
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,000
classicist friends will forgive me if I

470
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,160
abbreviate me meme to meme if it is any

471
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,600
consolation it could alternatively be

472
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,120
thought of as being related to memory or

473
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,560
to the French word m it should be

474
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,440
pronounced to rhyme with cream I'm sure

475
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,120
he didn't foresee how that word meme

476
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,759
would eventually get its own life but

477
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,920
this book is a controversial one just

478
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,279
because Dawkins is controversial see

479
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,600
Dawkins became famous for his obnoxious

480
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,680
atheist propaganda more than his actual

481
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,079
work in biology and this is kind of sad

482
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,839
because it's kind of cringe but luckily

483
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,959
this book doesn't have a lot of that it

484
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,240
just is a pure Biology book and indeed

485
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,319
it is fundamentally a book about

486
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,000
genetics if you don't understand

487
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,839
genetics at a fundamental level then you

488
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,880
do not understand human nature the

489
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,880
previous book analyzes human nature from

490
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
a psychologist perspective Dawkins

491
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,520
approaches it from a biology and

492
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,799
ecologist perspective it goes into

493
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,559
questions like why is a man's strategy

494
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,000
in the dating market so much different

495
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,799
than a woman it answers questions about

496
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,160
how many Traditions arise in the first

497
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,120
split like for example why do most

498
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,799
societies consider it okay for men to

499
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,200
sleep around but when a woman does it

500
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,880
it's just completely Haram and why some

501
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
societies think it's Haram for both

502
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
sexes fascinating stuff if you have any

503
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,200
interest in biology then this is

504
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,640
absolutely must read and it does go into

505
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,440
the dark topic of parasites which trust

506
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,440
me that is going to be something on this

507
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,160
channel which I discussed the

508
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,120
manipulation of parasites on indeed the

509
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
human psyche is something which I have

510
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,600
become more understanding of that indeed

511
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,679
is the next stage of this channel I

512
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,720
discuss the really troubling rate of

513
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,360
infections of parasites in humans even

514
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
in First World countries and I will

515
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,720
slowly share with you piece by piece how

516
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,559
to defeat this at this point I hope you

517
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,000
already understand the dangers of

518
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,159
xenoestrogens good that's the first step

519
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,679
but it is by no means the last step it

520
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,480
is my pleasure and privilege to bring

521
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,840
you this information about health

522
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,000
optimization which the big governmental

523
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,400
bodies simply have no interest in doing

524
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,799
finally I'll say that this reading list

525
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,000
to give you is just a tiny fraction of

526
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,440
my esoteric reading list so there's a

527
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,520
link in the description go to my website

528
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,400
you don't have to give me your email or

529
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
anything you'll find the total list the

530
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,240
full list and you can pick and choose

531
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,720
whatever appeals to you and if you're

532
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,360
interested in reading and you want to

533
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,280
take your reading to the next level not

534
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,039
only reading stuff but also discussing

535
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,840
it with like-minded peers then

536
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,080
potentially my private Community is open

537
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,720
for right now we're taking new members

538
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
at this time and these members have

539
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,720
access to all my courses so this is

540
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
something you're interested in then

541
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,000
there is a link in the description below

542
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,200
so what books do you think should belong

543
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,240
on my list put in the comments your

544
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,520
favorite books about the nature of

545
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,520
reality and human nature itself
