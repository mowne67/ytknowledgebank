1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,560
all right boys quick video for you

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,200
showing you how to use strategy and

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,600
planning tools which I have behind me as

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,319
you know time is not the principal

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,800
resource from which all things stem

6
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,320
rather it is energy and strategy

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,000
everybody has time it depends what you

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,519
do with that time energy comes from

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,039
holistic wellness and health which I've

10
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,240
described in many other videos before

11
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,080
but today we'll take a look at strategy

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,160
I'm going to show you these two tools so

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,760
what we have with us today is first we

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,720
have this corkboard which is my progress

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
tracker everything gets tracked on here

16
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,359
each of these sticky notes represents a

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
video and as they progress the different

18
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,840
stages of creating a video for example

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
ideation then we have the actual

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,160
recording then editing thumbnails and

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,600
then uploading right so there's multiple

22
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,920
stages for each of these so this allows

23
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,000
me to have autistic level control and

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,920
tracking of the progress of each of the

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,520
videos which I'm working on for example

26
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,079
let's take this esoteric lucid dreaming

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,559
guide so this is a video which I want to

28
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,800
make I want to make a video on lucid

29
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,640
dreaming so it's just an idea at this

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
point but once I actually script it out

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
I will move it to this column once I

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,440
actually record it I'll move it here

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,120
once I submit it for editing to my

34
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,719
editor I'm going to move it here and

35
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,799
once it's actually done I'll move it to

36
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,080
the edge and that's the conclusion of

37
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,040
its uh Journey basically so it allows me

38
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,280
to have extremely intense tracking for

39
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,960
the multiple projects which I'm working

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
on you can see how it works for videos

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,799
but also works great for like if you

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
have multiple homeworks or assignments

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,360
or projects of any kind if you're a

44
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
coder and you are doing different coding

45
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,280
projects it works for that it works for

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
literally anything just use your

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,200
imagination it works best when all the

48
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,200
different tasks are the same like all of

49
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,240
these represent a video so the stages

50
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,520
are the same for all of them all videos

51
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,240
need to go through ideation scripting

52
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,840
recording and so on so it makes sense if

53
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,759
I had different types of projects then I

54
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,320
would have a separate board for each

55
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,560
type of project now we go on to this

56
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,000
side this is my cloud board or so I like

57
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,479
to call it it's just a standard

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,920
whiteboard what I'm doing here is I'm

59
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,159
clustering tasks so I'm bringing order

60
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,280
to chaos by clustering the task by

61
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,920
classification so for example I have

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,320
here my nutrition cookbook so nutrition

63
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,079
cookbook is something which I'm planning

64
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,880
to create I'm going to be including it

65
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,280
to my members in my private Community

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,280
the country club I'm also going to be

67
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,399
including it for whoever purchases the

68
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,560
esoteric men's nutrition course at the

69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
time of recording that course is not

70
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,400
even out yet but it might be by the time

71
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
you're watching it so that course is

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
going to come with this cookbook but the

73
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,560
thing is the cookbook is not done yet so

74
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,239
I need to do a couple tasks to make it

75
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,120
happen I need to compile my recipes I

76
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,519
need to compile my ingredient lists I'm

77
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,440
going to have to create my micro and

78
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,080
macronutrient profiles I'm going to have

79
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,959
to create the meal plans so a bunch of

80
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
different tasks which cluster under the

81
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,800
title of nutrition cookbook and let's

82
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
take another example onboarding overhaul

83
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,760
so like I said I have that private

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Community Country Club and it has an

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,879
onboarding sequence so as soon as

86
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,360
somebody joins there's a set of sequence

87
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,640
which they need to progress through to

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,519
really get the best out of the

89
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,120
experience and right now it's there like

90
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,560
there is an onboarding in place but it's

91
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,440
not perfect I want to improve it I want

92
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,720
to perfect it and that requires a

93
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,599
certain level of dedication a certain

94
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,879
number of tasks to be completed and I've

95
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,599
organized those into this Cloud so the

96
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,720
reason I do it in clouds is just for the

97
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,040
Aesthetics of it so it's almost like a

98
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,200
sky some days I'm going to have a lot of

99
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,680
different tasks a lot of clouds and each

100
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,959
cloud is heavy with tasks and it's like

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,799
an overcast sky but I know with

102
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,920
determination and hard work I'm going to

103
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,480
be able to clear clouds one by one so as

104
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440
soon as I get done with the onboarding

105
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,959
overhaul I'll just erase it off the

106
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
board and then there'll be one less

107
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,159
cloud on my sky so what I'm trying to

108
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,680
work for is of course a clear sky

109
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,159
there's no clouds I have no tasks going

110
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,959
on I'm just chilling I know it might be

111
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,040
corny I don't really care because this

112
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,439
is what works for me man I like to have

113
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,840
a kind of visual or artistic take to the

114
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,080
things which I do it's just the way I

115
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,720
work it's just why my psychology works

116
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
so do what works for you and then here

117
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,480
is a timeline so I have a hard deadline

118
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,959
for the 22nd I need to get all this

119
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,599
stuff done by the 22nd so I'm marking

120
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,640
down the days and I'm also logging the

121
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,560
stuff which gets done per day so I have

122
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,159
a clear timeline on what needs to get

123
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,680
done when so then we have the order of

124
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,360
business I have priorities non

125
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,720
priorities and stasis so priorities are

126
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
of course the task which you need to get

127
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
done right now then non priorities are

128
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,280
things which kind of can wait and then

129
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,120
stasis is stuff which I'm not going to

130
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,560
even think about for example I want to

131
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,040
grow on Instagram I want to go on

132
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,799
Twitter but I don't have the bandwidth

133
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,280
to do that stuff right now so I'm just

134
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,760
going to put on stasis I'll get to it

135
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,159
when I get to it then we have the

136
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,120
autistic level day-to-day plan so Monday

137
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,160
Tuesday Wednesday all the way Thursday I

138
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,479
literally have a bullet point for every

139
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,639
task that I need to do and as I get

140
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,199
these things done I'll just take them

141
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,560
off as I go along so it allows me to

142
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,040
have a lot of control it tells me

143
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,800
exactly what needs to get done per day

144
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,080
and here I just have a bunch of notes

145
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,600
it's just my ideas list so I have more

146
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,680
than 84 I have 84 video ideas right now

147
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,320
on hand which is probably all the videos

148
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,880
I need for the next year so there you

149
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
have it boys I'm going to take an idea

150
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,800
from this convert it into a a sticky

151
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,400
note put it on this board and then I'll

152
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,560
go and push it through the entire

153
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,240
sequence of video creation and that's

154
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,360
essentially how I run my YouTube channel

155
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,360
and I want you to use your own

156
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,080
imagination and adapt these techniques

157
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,080
for whatever work it is that you do
