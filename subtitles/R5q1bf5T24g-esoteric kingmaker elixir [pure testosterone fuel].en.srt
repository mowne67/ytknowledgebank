1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,839
this is the esoteric King maker Elixir a

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,319
cousin to the world famous esoteric

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,880
eggnog Elixir it's easier to make has

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,719
fewer ingredients and it's just as

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,679
nutritious this drink will help you

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,559
recover from your workouts unlike

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,600
anything else if you're looking to gain

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,080
muscle or build strength there's really

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,279
nothing like this it tastes like summer

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,160
it tastes like sunshine and rainbows it

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,480
tastes like mango and honey this is

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,000
truly the drink of the Gods and Kings so

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,279
for the esoteric King maker Elixir what

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,120
ingredients do we need we need milk we

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,680
need yogurt we need mango chunks honey

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,200
eggs so it's what 1 2 3 4 5 just five

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,719
ingredients in order to have a top 1%

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,800
nutrition plan all you need to do is

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,760
create or learn seven recipes total and

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
just rotate them you don't even need to

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,879
learn seven at the same time you just

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,879
need to collect them like you collect

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,359
PokÃ©mon cards or something and I believe

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,719
that this recipe can be one of your

25
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,239
standard seven every man needs to have a

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,399
standard seven recipes that he is a god

27
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,439
at every man will find himself at some

28
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,680
point having the opportunity to show off

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,840
his cooking skills if you spent months

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
and years perfecting your standard seven

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,799
you can appear like a pro without

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,680
necessarily being one first you need

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,280
milk preferably you can get milk low

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,520
temperature pasturized or even raw milk

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,720
in my opinion is the king of all drinks

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,759
it is the perfect blend of protein and

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,000
fats it is one of the primary reasons of

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,439
the success of certain tribes if I can

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,560
get it in a glass bottle I would but in

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,759
Hawaii it's just not possible and so I

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:41,240
get the plastic one however this is not

42
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,360
just BPA free but it's also BPA F and S

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,280
free pretty good second I'm making sure

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,479
that the milk is from cows that were not

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,399
given RBST RBST is recombinant Bine

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,600
somatotropin it's essentially growth

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,119
hormone for cows they use this because

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,119
it upregulates the cow's milk production

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,960
but there's a trade-off there's always a

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,600
trade-off RBST also downregulates

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,200
immunity so you need more antibiotics if

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,200
you look at milk cartons or even uh milk

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,959
products you'll find a strange paragraph

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,640
it'll say something like the FDA doesn't

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,519
find a difference between RBST milk and

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,560
non rbsd milk this is actually a result

57
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,200
of one of the most interesting legal

58
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,480
cases involving of course the infamous

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Monsanto corporation so Monsanto

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,080
actually went to war with small farmers

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,800
who are labeling their milk as RBST free

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,120
they basically um their case was that if

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,360
Farms brand their milk as RBST free then

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
they were implying that monsanto's RBST

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,640
milk was somehow inferior so they were

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,319
able to go through the legal system and

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,200
make the case that if a farm was to

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,239
claim RBST free they also had to say

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,440
that the FDA does not find a difference

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,480
between RBST milk and non RBST milk me

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,239
personally I'm just going to go with the

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,519
non RBST milk regardless of what

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,480
monsanto's position on this matter is

74
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,440
but coming back to milk why is it

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,280
important to get grass fed this is

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,280
because cow's digestive systems are not

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,760
built for grain feeding if you feed them

78
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,799
with grain the Rin becomes more acidic

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,239
and thanks to Natural Selection the

80
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,319
ecoli in that Rin becomes acid resistant

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,879
usually our stomach acids are strong

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,000
enough to destroy most ecoli strains but

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,360
it cannot handle the acid resistant

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
version of eoli so again the risk of

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,560
infection increases which means that the

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,040
companies need to add more antibiotics

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,879
to the animals finally I'm looking for

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,920
A2 versus A1 milk A2 milk is preferable

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
because it contains a higher

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,120
concentration of CLA which is conjugated

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,640
linolic acid and also at milk is just

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
overall more digestible for most people

93
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,239
second ingredient we want some high

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,360
quality yogurt just plain yogurt just as

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,680
high quality milk stands Head and

96
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,040
Shoulder above regular milk high quality

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,760
yogurt stands about regular yogurt a

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
brand like f contains twice the amount

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,640
of protein per serving as does a brand

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,280
like Denon but besides this some Brands

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,079
add fillers and additives if you see in

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,880
the labeling if you see milk protein

103
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,239
concentrate so

104
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,160
MPC um yeah milk pudding concentrate if

105
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,919
you find that ingredient in your yogurt

106
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,600
then your yogurt is likely trash and I

107
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,320
always aim for the higher fat percentage

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,039
because fat is a feature not a bug and

109
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,680
if I'm going to pay for this product I

110
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,800
might as well get all the nutrition

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,960
benefits of this third we're looking for

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,199
the pasture raised eggs when it comes to

113
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,520
eggs the labeling is crazy there's so

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,280
many different labels and some of them

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,199
don't mean anything and some of them are

116
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,800
actually useful to look for what should

117
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,800
you look for look for certified Humane

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,400
the label for certified Humane it means

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,160
it's been third party verified and then

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,759
what that what does that mean it means

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,199
that these chickens spend more time

122
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,199
Outdoors which means that they

123
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,039
synthesize more vitamin D which they can

124
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,320
concentrate into their eggs so happy

125
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,479
hens lay better eggs fourth we're

126
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,240
looking for raw honey especially if you

127
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,240
can find raw unfiltered or even unheated

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
honey that would be the best pasteurized

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,360
honey loses its enzymes and its

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,199
antioxidant benefits but here's the main

131
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,240
thing if the ingredients of your honey

132
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,560
contains dextrose sugar syrup or

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,160
anything other than honey it's not honey

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,840
Fifth and final ingredient is the Frozen

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,880
mango chunks mango is the king of all

136
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,440
fruits the star ingredient of this

137
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,960
recipe when people talk about nutritious

138
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,039
fruits they often are talking about like

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,400
blueberries or kiwis oranges sometimes

140
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,080
dates but mango is really not mentioned

141
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,800
but the truth is mango is actually

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,400
pretty great it's better than Apples at

143
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,479
almost everything but besides mangoes

144
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
just taste amazing and so forms the

145
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,600
Cornerstone of the king maker elixer

146
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,160
once we have these ingredients now all

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,440
we're doing is combining them in equal

148
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,800
parts so the three main ingredients for

149
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,319
the recipe is the chunks the um the

150
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,479
yogurt and the milk so just one part of

151
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,120
each plus one egg plus 2 tbspoon of

152
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,639
honey so first what I'm going to do is

153
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,440
take handful of

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,599
mangoes drop them in there and I'm going

155
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,080
for an

156
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,520
approximately 200 mL then I add in 200

157
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,520
mL of the

158
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:31,319
milk then I will add

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,319
in 200 mL of the yogurt

160
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,319
boys I know you haven't tasted this yet

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,039
but this is genuinely one of the best

162
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,639
recipes I know highly highly recommend

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,479
trying it out the egg one of you

164
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,160
actually taught me this the easiest and

165
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,720
the correct way to break an egg is not

166
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,560
is not by hitting it against the edge of

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,759
something and it is not by taking a

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,599
spoon and whacking it that's the wrong

169
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,160
way to crack an egg how you actually do

170
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,000
it is find a flat surface like this

171
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,800
glass top and one

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
crack

173
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,639
and open it up and the reason for this

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,479
is this way you minimize any contact of

175
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,960
the egg whites with the shell of the

176
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,720
actual egg in so doing you reduce the

177
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,440
chance of any kind of infection or

178
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,440
illness because it's often times the

179
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,280
eggshell the outside of the eggshell

180
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,560
which contains uh the germs

181
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,080
so yes I know raw eggs might make you

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,759
sick whatever

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
I've been having RS for a long time I'm

184
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,520
okay with the risk not saying that you

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
should be okay with the risk but I am if

186
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,120
you want to full Deep dive into the

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,479
risks and rewards of raw eggs I actually

188
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,360
have a video on that exact topic which I

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,400
will be sure to add to the description

190
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,800
below so what do we have now we have the

191
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,159
yogurt we have milk we have egg we have

192
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
mangoes we need the honey this is the

193
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,080
highly esoteric approved Indo-European

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,000
honey from Turkey actually turkey is

195
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,800
actually uh a source of really high

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,120
quality honey but coming to the recipe

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm just eyeballing about two

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,639
tablespoons of

199
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,759
this being pretty generous because I am

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,479
right now my priority with diet is just

201
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,560
increase muscle mass increased strength

202
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
because I had that um surgery back in

203
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,879
November of last year leading up to the

204
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
surgery I was extremely weak which is

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,120
why I had the surgery in the first place

206
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,520
and then after the surgery there's a

207
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,159
long postoperative period where I

208
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,440
couldn't really lift weights or anything

209
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,880
so honestly the entire year of 2024 was

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
rough from a physique standpoint just

211
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,479
lost a lot of strength lot a lot of lost

212
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,240
a lot of muscle but hey that's where the

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,279
king maker elixer comes in this will

214
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,920
basically rebuild me and I'll will show

215
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
you some pictures of my progress in the

216
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,320
past what is it Fe right right now it's

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,640
February right so four five months if

218
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,320
that not even right just made a massive

219
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,480
amount of progress in the gym boys just

220
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,640
through nutrition like this so I

221
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,600
strongly recommend giving it a shot ah I

222
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,399
almost forgot to talk about this one

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,720
thing hold up hold up hold up so this is

224
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,440
an interesting ingredient it's cestrum

225
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,360
now it's a very hyped ingredient so

226
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,240
let's discuss this here's the deal with

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,959
this we have some initial studies

228
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,200
showing chrom to be a superfood it

229
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,959
contains the antibodies IGG and IG it

230
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,519
destroys infections basically and it

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,000
even contains the um igf1 and igf2 which

232
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,440
are essentially growth factors some are

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,920
saying that by consuming chrom as a

234
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,360
supplement you can maximize your height

235
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,720
is there any truth to this or is it just

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,480
marketing well if you have the money to

237
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,120
spend yeah you can go and try it out

238
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,360
it's not that it's a bad supplement it's

239
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,399
just very low leverage for the price you

240
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,839
pay you can get much better value for

241
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,360
your money with just something like hard

242
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,880
cheese the main benefit of chrom is that

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,959
it improves The Taste and texture of

244
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,880
this King maker Elixir which is why I

245
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,519
have it but once this canister is done I

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,600
probably wouldn't repurchase it see the

247
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,000
thing is you don't need these esoteric

248
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,640
supplements as it were you don't need

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
cestrum you don't need uh you don't

250
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,880
need any of this stuff you just need to

251
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,800
be good at the fundamentals in fact one

252
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,600
of the first things I do in my cohorts

253
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
is I ask people what supplements they

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
take and just slash them cuz you don't

255
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,040
need that these are all distractions all

256
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,560
these weird supplements that people are

257
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
taking nowadays spending lots and lots

258
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,120
of money on are just distractions just

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,760
focus on a solid Whole Foods diet and

260
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,480
that's 99% of the work once you have 99%

261
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
of nutrition solved you're already

262
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,800
consistent you're already making

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
progress then if you have money to spend

264
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
and you're like okay what supplements

265
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,040
can I try then yeah go for the tonat Ali

266
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,160
go for the frodia agrestis go for all

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,279
the huberman subs the truth is you're

268
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,320
not hubman huberman has already dialed

269
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,639
in everything to an autistic level and

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,200
then he has some small benefits from

271
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,480
these supplements unless you're huberman

272
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,720
in terms of your health optimization you

273
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,000
just are wasting your money that money

274
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,720
and the the bandwidth like the mental

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,480
bandwidth are much better spent

276
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,279
Elsewhere for example like this tub of

277
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,160
chestone right think cost 60 bucks and

278
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,600
I'll tell you right now that this ninja

279
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,519
creamy uh blender right I'm just going

280
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
to show this to the camera is also

281
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,440
around 60 bucks maybe 70 and this is

282
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,760
just much higher leverage like getting a

283
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,240
high quality blender is way better use

284
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,040
of your money than a chrom supplement is

285
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,279
going to be so I'm not against spending

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,760
money on health far from it my internal

287
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,680
guideline is actually to go broke

288
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,560
investing in myself all I'm saying is I

289
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
want to make sure that my investments go

290
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,800
towards things that actually make a big

291
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,800
impact so if you have $60 to invest in

292
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,320
health get a good blender don't get

293
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,480
cestrone so now let's go blend this bad

294
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,680
boy up and see how it

295
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,040
tastes all right it's Blended it's time

296
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,760
for the legendary taste test so let's go

297
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,760
ahead get our yourself a

298
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,920
glass all right now here is a true

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,320
esoteric tier ingredient it is saffron

300
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,480
so how many do you need just need like

301
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,480
that many ah

302
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,240
perfect so how does it taste it tastes

303
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,839
like something Fit For A King it's so

304
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,839
rich and creamy and sweet but it also

305
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,920
has a subtle Tang from the yogurt so

306
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,880
it's not so sweet that it's cloying

307
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,560
instead it's actually quite refreshing

308
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,839
the hint of honey just takes this and

309
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,720
elevates this to a Divine status and the

310
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,079
Egg you can't even really taste the egg

311
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,680
so try it out and comment below your

312
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,680
experience with the esoteric K maker

313
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,680
elixir
