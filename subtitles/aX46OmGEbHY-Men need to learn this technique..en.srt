1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Attention chatting. It has come to my

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,720
attention that some of y'all don't know

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,599
how to cut a pineapple correctly. This

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,679
was me. Few weeks ago, I decided to cut

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,160
my first pineapple on YouTube. I decided

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,199
to see how to cut a pineapple. What I

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,279
discovered was lies. Lies upon lies from

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,039
big pineapple giving you incorrect

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
pineapple cutting techniques. There is

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
only one correct pineapple cutting

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
technique. And I shall reveal this

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,400
secret to you today. I will tell you

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,000
what most pineapple amateurs do not

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,200
know. First, we do start with cutting

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,239
the head off. Next, we do in fact cut

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,520
its ass off. Next step also is commonly

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,079
known. We cut it in half. Here's where

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,320
the changes happen. Here's where the

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
highly esoteric pineapple crafting

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,960
techniques come into play. A lot of

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,160
pineapple amateurs,

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
what they do is they try to remove this

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
core and then try to slice the pineapple

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
up in different ways. Wrong. They don't

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,320
know what they're doing. What you do now

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,520
is you chop this,

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,920
chop this, and then instead of removing

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,520
the core with a diagonal slice, you

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,840
instead

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,720
remove it using two slices at right

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,840
angles to one another, thereby removing

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,759
the core, extracting this pestilential

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,640
piece of pineapple that cannot be eaten

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,560
by human beings, leaving behind as much

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,119
pineapple

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
bold as possible.

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
Then you slice that in half. Now you

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,799
have these segments of pineapple and

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:49,200
then you extract its armor, revealing

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,759
the succulent insides of pineapple. But

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
the secret to good pineapple carving

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
starts even before you start carving the

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
pineapple. You got to choose good

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,719
pineapples. And that begins by looking

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,200
at its exterior. You're looking for a

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,479
nice golden non-green outer surface.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
Sometimes there would be like sugar

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
leaking out. That's actually a good

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
sign. What you're doing is you're

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,080
looking for some compressibility, but

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
not much. And of course, the smell. If

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
your pineapple doesn't smell like

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
pineapple, it's just not ripe enough.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,800
You need to give it more time. Then you

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,840
do the same square

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
indents out of all these pineapples.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
And once you do this, you will be

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,360
rewarded by the gift of the gods

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:44,120
themsel, the Hawaiian royal pineapple

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,120
from the dough plantations themselves.

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
Most pineapples you probably had are

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
from a can.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
And even if they're not, they probably

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
have this weird prickly sensation which

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
they create in your mouth. This is

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,319
caused because pineapples have this

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,080
enzyme which in them within them which

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,480
basically kind of eats some part of your

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,560
skin as you're eating them. It's a it's

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
a it's almost like a digestive enzyme.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
This is what causes that prickly

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,480
sensation. But pineapples which are

73
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,319
fresh don't have this. So, if you can

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
get fresh pineapples, which you can get

75
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,239
in some places only, Latin America and

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,519
Hawaii, then you are in luck and you

77
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,239
have been blessed. All the armor has

78
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,680
been separated. Now, we got some hiding.

79
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
And that, my friends, is a pineapple

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
completely carved up in a matter of

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
seconds. Now, you can choose to chop

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
them up into chunks. You don't really

83
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,319
need to. All you need to do is grab one

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,560
of these as they are and let's do a

85
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,560
taste test.

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:06,000
A a ripe fresh pineapple doesn't have

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,080
that segmented crunchy feeling that a a

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,120
canned pineapple or a unripe pineapple

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040
might have. It has the same texture of

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,360
something like a mango where it just

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,560
your teeth just sink into it, but has a

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,440
flavor profile of pineapple. So, if you

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,479
have the opportunity to visit the

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,919
glorious Pacific Island of Hawaii, one

95
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,440
thing you must do is enjoy a Royal

96
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,160
Hawaiian pineapple.

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
I go.
