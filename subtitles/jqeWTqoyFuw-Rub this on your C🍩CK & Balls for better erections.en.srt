1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Rub this on your shaft and thank me

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
later. This is magnesium lotion and when

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
applied to the shaft, it basically

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
guarantees morning wood. I learned this

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
from a bodybuilder friend who said that

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,799
applying magnesium lotion to aching

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,640
muscles alleviates muscle soreness. So I

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,800
had this brilliant idea in the name of

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,039
science of course. What happens if you

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,119
apply this down there? When I realized

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
that the effects were noticeable, I

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,119
suggested this to five of my coaching

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
clients and they too had similar

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,359
results. And so I bring this information

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
to you. Now to be clear, there's no

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
scientific evidence for this. There are

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,800
no papers published about this. This is

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
literally cutting edge. Why would

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,760
topically applied magnesium increase

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
erectile strength? I think this is the

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,520
reason. This is the cross-section of the

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,920
penile length. These two areas are

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
called the corposa cavernosa. These are

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
sponge-like tissues that when engorged

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,800
with blood cause the erection in the

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,840
first place. So if the blood vessels in

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,879
these tissues are blocked by

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,000
calcification, you will have less blood

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,920
flow into the shaft and therefore weaker

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
erections. We don't want this. So we

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
need to reverse calcification. This is

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
where the magnesium comes in. And we

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,799
know this for a fact that magnesium ions

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,720
can undo calcification. So the

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
hypothesis is that applying magnesium

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,200
topically seeps through in into the

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
shaft and causes a reduction in the

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
calcification of these blood vessels in

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,759
so doing improving the erectile

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
strength. Now the obvious question is we

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,080
don't want calcification. We want to

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,079
reduce the chances of calcification not

43
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,400
just in the blood vessels of the shaft

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
but just blood vessels overall. So what

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
causes calcification? Well, it's caused

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,439
by LDL which is called the bad

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
cholesterol. But then here again it's

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,040
not the LDL which is the culprit. It's

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,079
more so that damaged LDL is the culprit.

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,920
So what damages LDL? Well, when

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,640
polyunsaturated fatty acids get

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,479
incorporated into the structure of LDL,

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
it causes them to be more prone to

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
oxidative damage. Now, where the hell do

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
polyunsaturated fatty acids come from?

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,520
They come from commonly used cooking

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
oils, which the internet is now calling

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,319
seed oils, things like soybean oil,

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
groundut oil, any kind of fry oil

60
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,520
really. all of the things which are used

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
in basically all fast food restaurants

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
and even upscale restaurants unless you

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
specifically demand or ask that their

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
your food be prepared in butter or

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
tallow. Now, speaking of erections, if

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
you're below the age of 40 and you

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,239
aren't waking up with morning wood

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
basically every day, this might be a

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
sign of bad hormonal health. The first

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,160
step you need to take is get blood work

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
done. This will serve as a road map and

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
give you the next steps on what to do.

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
There's three key problems with getting

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
blood work. The first is you don't know

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
what biomarkers to get. The second is

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,599
you think it's expensive or you think

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
you need to go through insurance. The

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
third is well even if you get your

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
results back you don't know what the

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
results actually mean so you don't take

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,160
next steps. We can solve all these

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,760
problems for free. There's a form in the

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,239
description below that you'll fill out

84
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,920
and we myself or my team who are

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
certified in functional blood chemistry

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,000
analysis can help you out. When it comes

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to magnesium this is not just something

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
that you can apply to your shaft. It is

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
also something that you can consume

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,319
orally. Magnesium comes in many

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
different forms. So first I have this

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,120
tablet form. I have this electrolyte

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
liquid form. I also have magnesium

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
lactate in a powdered form. So why focus

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,480
on magnesium? It's because practically

96
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,040
everybody is deficient. 15% are

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,760
chronically deficient and then 50% more

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,519
than 50% of Americans are below the

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
recommended dosage of magnesium. The

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
recommended doses of magnesium isn't

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,799
even that high. It's my personal belief

102
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,799
that a lot of heart disease in the US

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
can be reversed by supplementing with

104
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
magnesium. You may have heard of

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
different forms of magnesium. There's

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
glycinate, thrienate, citrate and so on.

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
I'll make all this very simple in the

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
protocol which I'm going to give you. So

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440
in the morning just choose between

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,319
magnesium citrate or malate and take 400

111
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,720
mg. And at night again 400 millig of

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,640
glycinate or 3enate plus the magnesium

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
chloride lotion. You'll notice that the

114
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,760
average daily allowance is actually just

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
400 millig. So I take almost more than

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,680
twice of this. Now we have to talk about

117
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,519
how and where to apply the magnesium

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
lotion. Well, this video is about of

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
course the benefits to applying it to

120
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,360
the shaft, but it's not just the shaft.

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
You can apply this anywhere. It's just a

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
lotion. Specifically for sleep, I

123
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
recommend applying it to the base of

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,320
your feet. So, the feet are one of the

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
regions of our body through which we

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,280
regulate temperature while sleeping.

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
This is why a lot of people will stick

128
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,479
out one foot out of the blankets in

129
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
order to cool themselves down. Applying

130
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,120
magnesium lotion to the feet allows the

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,040
body to eject more heat because as the

132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
moisture in the lotion evaporate, it

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,800
takes some of the heat with it. This

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
protocol is especially important if

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
you're physically active, if you're

136
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
going to the gym, but also important if

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,160
you are a knowledge worker, if you're

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
spending deep work hours getting work

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,040
done, and certainly you need to treat

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
yourself as an athlete of the mind. And

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll leave you with a reminder that

142
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,919
being healthy in a sick society gives

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
you an unfair advantage. The first step

144
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
in seizing this advantage is to get your

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
blood work done. Use the link in the

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,440
description below. We can help you with

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
that.
