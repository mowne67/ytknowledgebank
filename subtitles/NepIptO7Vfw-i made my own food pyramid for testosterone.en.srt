1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,000
those look like ball okay now it looks

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,200
like tips so don't believe the jackasses

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,600
who say fruit are bad because they

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,320
contain sugar of course they contain

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,400
sugar that's the whole point carrots

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,280
will actually improve your skin tone

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,480
pork and poultry are both monogastric

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,240
humans don't synthesize vitamin C most

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,720
animals actually do this all right boys

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,320
you know it's serious when I'm off my

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,400
ass and I'm actually delivering a

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,640
lecture on a whiteboard so this one is

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
about the esoteric food pyramid we

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
already know that the government issued

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,359
food pyramid is trash so it's time that

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,200
we make our own one based on the

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,079
principles outlined in this course so

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
let's start off with the first thing the

19
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,440
Keystone of this diet is red meat

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,960
especially red meat from ruminants so

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,000
ruminants are animals which have a

22
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,120
multi-stem digestive tract like cows

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,800
sheep and lamb goats all these guys have

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
a multi-stage digestion process which

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,320
means that their fat quality is going to

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,879
be better so monogastric animals like

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,559
chicken turkey pork their protein

28
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,079
quality is on par right they're the same

29
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,399
in terms of of protein quality but

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,720
they're not the same in terms of fat

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,200
quality that's why we start off with red

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,759
meat red meat especially from ruminant

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
so let me go ahead and draw a nice ribey

34
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,640
I don't know if this is going to come

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,040
out well but we'll give it a go that's

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,720
supposed to be a riy boys so a nice

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,320
ribey is the ultimate piece of our

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,320
puzzle here and I will say that this is

39
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,360
going to be costly red meats from

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,880
ruminants are usually expensive lamb

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,600
meat for example at least in the US is

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
really expensive it's it's much cheaper

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,079
elsewhere because there's more demand

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,000
for it but in the US lamb meat is kind

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,880
of expensive of course a riy is really

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
going to set you back but you don't have

47
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,280
to get a riy so that's the thing red

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,320
meat doesn't have to be expensive it

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,719
depends on the cut so get good at making

50
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,759
meals from the so-called less desirable

51
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,240
cuts which are equally nutritious it's

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,320
just that there's not as much demand for

53
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,159
them so what you do is look for steel

54
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,439
meat so Ste meat most people don't know

55
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,719
how to use it most people don't buy it

56
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,799
so there's not that much demand the

57
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,280
prices are low but it's massively neut

58
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,520
nutritious or choose ground Meats ground

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,119
beef ground venison can be really an

60
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,080
amazing source of nutrition especially

61
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,039
because they often do contain organ

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,319
Meats so become an expert on cooking and

63
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,560
creating meals from the so-called less

64
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,519
desirable or off Cuts can save a lot of

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,280
money but get optimal nutrition at the

66
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,640
same time and not just optimal nutrition

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
this is Elite tier nutrition so that's

68
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,160
the first entry into our list is red

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,640
meats could be ground beef could be

70
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,280
ground venison could be lamb could be

71
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,319
goat could be sheep could be any of

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,160
these the next next item on this list is

73
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,080
of course eggs high quality eggs the

74
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,519
quality is of course important so red

75
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,239
meat you're going to get grass-fed grass

76
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,239
finished eggs we're going to get them

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,280
from pasture raised let me go ahead and

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
draw a nice basket how do you draw a

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,440
basket I don't feel like I haven't seen

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
a basket in a while but let me give it

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,120
my best approximation one dozen eggs so

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
how many eggs should you have you should

83
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,720
have at least two eggs per day l two day

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,360
two eggs a day minimum that's the

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
requirement you can go go all the way up

86
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,920
to 10 eggs if you so choose you really

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,400
want the eggs for the sulfur benefit the

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,560
sulfur is going to bind to and remove

89
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,440
excess iron highest quality protein on

90
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,879
here and indeed does have high quality

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,640
fats as well especially if you are not

92
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,480
going to eat red meats you should

93
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,239
supplement with eggs instead then we

94
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,640
move on to the next item which is

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,959
carrots carrots are really really good

96
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,159
for detox cuz they have these baa cartin

97
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,640
and also not just Berry cartin also

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,120
other catenoids which bind to and remove

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,879
estrogens they so remove Metals so

100
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,599
carrots are an amazing part of your diet

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,760
but this segment also includes things

102
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,159
like pumpkins and squashes which also

103
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,200
contain carotenoids so let me go ahead

104
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,319
and draw some carrots highly highly

105
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,879
highly beneficial and the thing is you

106
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,439
can have a lot of these carrots are

107
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,400
pretty low in um calories so whether

108
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,840
you're bulking or cutting doesn't matter

109
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,159
carrots are very low in calories you can

110
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,920
smash a whole bunch of them and the

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
coolest thing is carrots will actually

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,360
improve your skin tone so literally you

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,400
look better your skin will be more

114
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,680
lustrous more luxuriant In Color by

115
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,280
eating carrots because those beta

116
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,120
keratins they actually do become a part

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
of your skin not so important for me cuz

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
I have pretty dark skin already but if

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,920
you're super pale then carrots are a

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,000
important part of your diet then we have

121
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,040
poultry I'm going to also lump pork into

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,919
this because pork and poultry are both

123
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,120
monogastric so let's go ahead and write

124
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,080
P Tre and pork I'm not a huge fan of

125
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,960
pork myself I don't like the taste and I

126
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,880
tend to avoid myself except for bacon I

127
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
do enjoy bacon so poultry and pork these

128
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,400
are also good quality protein really

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,759
high quality protein I should say but

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,840
simply not on par with red meat that is

131
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,280
to say red meat from ruminants when it

132
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,320
comes to the fat quality let me go ahead

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,680
draw a chicken drumstick that is

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,360
terribly drawn but we're going to go

135
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,800
with it and finally we'll finish this

136
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,440
out with fruit fruit contains a lot of

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,680
vitamins and especially vitamin C humans

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
don't synthesize vitamin C most animals

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,720
actually do this but humans do not which

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
is why fruit is important for us so

141
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,720
don't believe the jackasses who say

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,280
fruit are bad because they contain sugar

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,600
of course they contain sugar that's the

144
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,639
whole point someon one of simple sugars

145
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
is really beneficial for us so yeah go

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,680
for fruit man fruits are not a problem

147
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,479
when it comes to fruits kiwi are solid

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,560
those look like balls that's a terrible

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,840
drawing then we have pomogranate another

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,880
solid option pomogranate looks like a

151
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,360
circle with a crown oranges oranges are

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,400
a nice option I don't know how to draw

153
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,680
an orange really I think okay now it

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,600
looks like tits so let's add another one

155
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,280
then we can also include coconut water

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
in here if you can get coconut water

157
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,600
that would be really cool coconut water

158
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,840
is the elite level electrolyte I'm not

159
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,440
sure if coconut water is a fruit as such

160
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,319
but I want to include it anyway of

161
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,560
course berries when it comes to berries

162
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,080
blueberries are a solid option let's

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,960
draw some blueberries oh grapes grapes

164
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,120
are a solid option as well bananas

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,840
especially if you're going to go work

166
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,160
out solid option so really any kind of

167
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,720
fruit are good and speaking of fruit and

168
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,479
also carrots you should absolutely wash

169
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,039
them well before you consume them

170
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,360
carrots not so much because carrots are

171
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,720
anyway under the ground so they're kind

172
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,240
of protected but fruits for sure for

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
sure you need to wash fruits before you

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,319
consume them when I say wash I'm saying

175
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,880
10% salt solution or 10% apple cider

176
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,599
vinegar solution soak them in there for

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,280
a little bit and give them a nice scrub

178
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,759
before you consume them and that's your

179
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,360
basic tier boys so this in itself is

180
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,599
going to set you apart like this diet

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,479
just this alone is already better better

182
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,960
than 90% of people around you but now we

183
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,639
take it one step further we introduce

184
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,759
some living Foods so I'm going to go

185
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,240
ahead and draw what I think a glass milk

186
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,800
bottle would look like not the best but

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,599
hey actually that's all bad I'm pretty

188
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,120
happy with it milk and I'm talking about

189
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,960
raw milk all right boys so you know the

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,400
drill raw milk high in probiotics has

191
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,599
live cultures in it the enzymes are not

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,280
destroyed by homogenization which means

193
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,560
that the enzymes in this milk is

194
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,360
actually going to help you digest it in

195
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,240
the first place so highly recommend some

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,319
raw milk if you can get raw milk that's

197
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,039
fine at least try to get nonhomogenized

198
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,039
ultra low temperature pasteurized

199
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,960
instead that's also a solid option do

200
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,520
not really go for the ultra pasteurized

201
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,479
stuff there's really no point in getting

202
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,240
those if you can get raw milk or low

203
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,080
temperature pasteurized good if you

204
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,759
cannot then just skip it and we'll go to

205
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,240
the next one which is honey I'm talking

206
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,919
again of raw honey and if you can get it

207
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,879
get unheated honey so the difference

208
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,759
between raw honey and just your regular

209
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,199
store Brad honey is that the enzymes are

210
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,479
destroyed upon heating so you don't want

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,599
the heating and let me go ahead and draw

212
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,759
some Honeycombs cuz the honeycomb is

213
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,199
also pure magic so you want to actually

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,960
get the honeycomb if you can honeycomb

215
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,960
contains its own Suite of minerals and

216
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,479
vitamins and enzymes highly recommend

217
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,039
let me go ahead and draw a b cuz these

218
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,360
guys are Real G's for making this stuff

219
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,159
be that looks like honey I think I can

220
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,000
deal with that so raw honey then finally

221
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,680
we finish out this layer with vegetables

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,759
that's right vegetables are not bad I

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
know that a lot of people are freaking

224
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,720
out because of plant toxins the hype is

225
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,479
overblown unless your diet is literally

226
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,840
a vegetarian based diet where you're

227
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,919
eating only vegetables that case yes

228
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,360
plant toxins will add up when it's a

229
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,159
part of your diet rather than your whole

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
diet plant toxins are not a problem

231
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,479
garlic is a great option for its detox

232
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,840
benefits is that how you draw a garlic

233
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,360
there we go garlic Ginger is a solid

234
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,440
option because it has thermogenic

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,599
properties potatoes are a great option

236
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,560
for smashing on the calories if you're

237
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,399
trying to bulk that's my approximation

238
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,640
of what potatoes look like then we have

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,680
other root vegetables so we can add

240
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
these into stews especially meat stews

241
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,800
makes it taste good we can have beetroot

242
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
and I know a lot of people will freak

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,680
out about beets because of the oxalates

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
and stuff don't cry about the oxalate

245
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,160
boys you're not having beats every

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
single day you're just having a small

247
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,440
amount of Beats as a part of a stew so

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,760
long as vegetables on the core of your

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,040
diet you're fine we can also have

250
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,240
radishes radishes are solid for a bunch

251
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,360
of reasons one of them is they contain

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,959
aromatase Inhibitors which is a really

253
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,959
cool benefit people have been having

254
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,560
vegetables for a very long time so it's

255
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,160
not going to hurt you all a sudden so

256
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,040
veg and this includes potatoes oh what

257
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,160
about grains so grains are fine in very

258
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,320
specific circumstances if you're having

259
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,079
whole grain based sourdough bread it's

260
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,440
fine so sour dough bread can also be

261
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,519
added into this let's see if I can draw

262
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,959
a loaf of bread without autism there we

263
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,760
go that's that's bread souro bread and

264
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,640
there we have it that's this triangle

265
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,640
done and finally we'll cap Stone this

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,120
entire pyramid with of course liver I'm

267
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:53,839
going to draw a nice big liver and put a

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,839
crown on it because yes indeed liver is

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,839
King there you go boys liver is the

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,320
ultimate multivitamin in nature highly

271
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,760
bio available really top of the line you

272
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,640
can toss out all your supplements if you

273
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
have liver you consume liver you don't

274
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,959
really need to cook it yourself you can

275
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
use liver crisps instead equally good

276
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,360
but much more easy to eat and finally

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,200
we'll close out with supplements you

278
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,640
don't need supplements they don't really

279
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,880
have a place on the pyramid they have a

280
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,600
place as an optional on top of the

281
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,480
pyramids so when it comes to supplements

282
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,920
what can you have whe makes sense if

283
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,760
you're trying to bulk but you're trying

284
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,200
to get way Protein Isolate and you're

285
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,720
trying to get the unflavored stuff then

286
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,320
there is a potential for cod liver oil

287
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,800
especially in the winter months I don't

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
use cod liver oil throughout the year

289
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,880
just the winter months you can also use

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,079
creatine and of course be cognizant that

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
if you see any hair loss then

292
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,680
immediately stop using creatine and then

293
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,959
the last one which is a possible good

294
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,639
supplement is collagen you can also use

295
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
glycine instead this is going to help

296
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,120
you fall asleep this is going to help

297
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
with your skin hair and nails there one

298
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
thing which is missing here you might

299
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,880
notice I haven't really talked about

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,200
butter I haven't talked about fats in

301
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,600
general that's because it's not a part

302
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,079
of the pyramid it's just something you

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
use for cooking for example if you're

304
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,399
going to make an omelette with eggs

305
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,240
you're going to use butter to do it if

306
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,600
you're going to make yourself a carrot

307
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
salad you're going to sprinkle black

308
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,160
seed oil or you're going to sprinkle

309
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,800
olive oil so there's not a separate

310
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
place for fats because that's

311
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,040
Incorporated in all the dishes that you

312
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,160
prepare so perhaps what I should do is I

313
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:34,920
should make a little special Circle in

314
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,440
here and use this for fats and I mean

315
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,959
butter I mean saturated fats by the way

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,639
butter I'm including here olive oil I'm

317
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:46,440
including black seed oil I'm including

318
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:50,160
ghee so let me go ahead and draw a nice

319
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,360
stick of butter looks like a cigarette

320
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,880
that's a terrible drawing of butter but

321
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,959
I don't think I can improve upon it

322
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,560
there you have it boys that is the acetc

323
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,519
food pyramid this is Elite level

324
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,320
nutrition

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,240
if you can actually Master this this is

326
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,440
better nutrition than the Kings and

327
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,079
rulers of olden times this is the

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,920
pyramid that's literally going to cause

329
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,160
your government officials and your

330
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,959
registered dietitians to have a stroke

331
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,079
if they see this thing this really goes

332
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,000
against all the average Normy BS this is

333
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,440
my personal guide for Designing my own

334
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,519
meal plans I hope this has helped you at

335
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,399
this time go ahead and Mark your module

336
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,399
as complete
