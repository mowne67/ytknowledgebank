1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
you have to understand these companies

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,840
don't give a single thing about your

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,819
health so let me give you the straight

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,580
of actionable steps right now just buzz

5
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,040
it off note that you must have a shower

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,480
filter installed any YouTuber who wants

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920
to talk about Hair Care without talking

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
about diet doesn't know what the hell

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
he's talking about Vitamin D supplements

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,520
are mostly trash when I was in my early

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,279
20s my hair was oily and gross and my

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,160
scalp was dry and Flaky which makes no

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,019
sense until you look at what shampoo is

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,699
actually made of and how it works from a

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,260
chemical perspective and then you see

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,320
what Procter and Gamble actually

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,660
engineered you see shampoo is one fat

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,480
psyop it's a multi-million dollar

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,640
industry which gives you the problem in

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,860
the first place and then sells you the

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
Cure you believe that shampooing your

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,700
hair every day or every other day is

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
normal and healthy because that's what

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,680
your parents did and that's what all the

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,180
advertising says this is complete BS I

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,379
want you to understand what hair really

27
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,420
is I actually look at it from an

28
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,699
evolutionary perspective so look at the

29
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,280
human body we barely have any hair on

30
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,199
our body compared to most animals

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,600
but on our head our hair grows

32
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,700
indefinitely that's because our head

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,799
hair and in men facial hair is an

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,720
indicator of health so if you're having

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,760
hair problems whether it's hair loss or

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
dry scalp Etc you don't solve this by

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,520
buying the next latest and greatest

38
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,159
product you have to look a little bit

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,140
deeper because hair quality and quantity

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,420
is an indicator of Health it's a signal

41
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,220
for attractiveness and mate Choice which

42
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,140
is the fancy biological way of saying

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,299
good hair makes you attractive to women

44
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,040
and of course other way also we find

45
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,960
women extremely attractive and they have

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
good healthy hair the science and my

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,020
instincts are in perfect alignment if

48
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,759
you ever run your fingers through a

49
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,740
woman's hair and it's full and it's

50
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,079
healthy and it smells nice that's

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,780
insanely attractive not because the hair

52
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,579
itself is healthy but because hair is an

53
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,200
indication of overall health and

54
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,000
fertility and of course in men a nice

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,220
full beard is an indicator of sexual

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,360
health an extreme virility I wish I

57
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,460
could grow with my beard but of course

58
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,079
the Army regulations prevent it if you

59
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,759
have a dog or a cat and you've noticed

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,380
that its fur is kind of patchy or if

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,360
it's shedding way more than normal you

62
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,939
don't try 10 different booze on it you

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,500
realize that the pet is stressed or sick

64
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,080
or there's something else wrong with it

65
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,940
and these changes in its fur are just an

66
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,379
indication we don't assume it's hair

67
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,239
fall is because of genetics and you

68
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,440
don't start using finasteride that is

69
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,340
the angle which I'm going to take I'm

70
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,780
going to teach you everything I know

71
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,819
most people don't know this but

72
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,160
shampooing every day is a modern

73
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,020
invention Procter and Gamble had a

74
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,660
massive massive advertising campaign in

75
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,819
the 1970s specifically targeting white

76
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,319
American women probably one of the most

77
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,819
impressionable demographics on the

78
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,500
planet and they fed upon their

79
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,060
insecurities and made them feel as

80
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,440
though their hair was gross and they

81
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,300
would lose their standing in the dating

82
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,340
Market if they didn't use Proctor and

83
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,360
Gamble's greatest products good looking

84
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,440
girl until you looked close dandruff you

85
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
have to understand these companies don't

86
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,800
give a single [ __ ] about your health so

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,019
looking at the statistics Americans wash

88
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,239
their hair five times a week the Spanish

89
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,920
and Italians washed their hair half of

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,440
that and I was just there I was in Spain

91
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,940
and Italy just a few days ago and they

92
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,500
have perfectly beautiful hair have you

93
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,879
ever seen a shampoo advertisement do you

94
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,580
know how they have that graphic going on

95
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,319
they show like a zoom Up 3D render of a

96
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,000
hair follicle and they have the shampoo

97
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,860
they're coming in and removing all the

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,260
impurities that's complete BS what's

99
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,360
really happening is the shampoo binds to

100
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,400
and removes fats from your scalp and

101
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,620
that causes your scalp to over produce

102
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,659
those oils which causes your hair to be

103
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,940
greasy and then you need more shampoo to

104
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,739
fix the problem and then they sell you a

105
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,140
conditioner to coat your hair in

106
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,519
silicone to make it look as though your

107
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,379
hair is actually nourished when it's

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,000
actually not so how did I realize the

109
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,400
shampoo and conditioner was BS well

110
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,280
actually I did a hard reset on my life a

111
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,560
hard reset so I was feeling very stalled

112
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,480
in life it's about a couple years ago

113
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,459
and of course there was a woman involved

114
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,860
who is no longer in my life I needed to

115
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,720
gain massive momentum so I developed a

116
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,580
hard reset protocol and I followed it

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,440
for a month and it worked amazingly but

118
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,659
for this video the important part was

119
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,220
one part of that protocol was to buzz my

120
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,900
hair out completely and I did and

121
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,220
because I didn't have a shampoo or

122
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,780
conditioner you know I didn't need

123
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,360
shampoo conditioner when you have buzzed

124
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,799
hair I didn't use it and by the way if

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
you want to know more about the hard

126
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,040
reset protocol let me know in the

127
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,420
comments I know my technique works

128
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,980
because usually when I go to the barber

129
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,900
and get a haircut my hair would fall

130
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,760
along with a whole bunch of flakes it

131
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,680
was super gross and I hated it but once

132
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,660
I got off shampoo and conditioner after

133
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,699
I buzzed my hair and used the natural

134
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,260
means to take care of my hair and then I

135
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,180
got my first haircut after the buzz

136
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,560
there was no flakes at all so I asked my

137
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,699
barber how my scalp looked it's

138
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,380
interesting because he says something

139
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,060
along the lines of okay it looks like

140
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,040
your shampoo is working I was like yeah

141
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,199
no it doesn't so note this like if you

142
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,540
have rings in your hair like rings of

143
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,979
flakes in your hair or your scalp rather

144
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,419
then that's not dandruff and that's not

145
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,860
dry skin that's some kind of an

146
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,240
infection and you need to see a actual

147
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,400
dermatologist and the quick thing about

148
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,680
hair loss so a lot of people think that

149
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,600
hair loss especially in men is caused by

150
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,979
testosterone this is not true just

151
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,820
having high testosterone doesn't mean

152
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,380
you're going to lose your hair that's

153
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,940
not a thing it's more complex than that

154
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,860
and an interesting thing is it's

155
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,840
actually stress which causes it and not

156
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,780
in the way that you think so stress

157
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,220
causes skin to be pulled taut over your

158
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,380
scalp so if you've ever seen a bald

159
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,240
person like a person who has lost their

160
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,740
hair you know how there's like scalp is

161
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,020
super shiny right that's because the

162
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,400
skin is pulled tight over their scalp

163
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,259
usually because of tightnesses in their

164
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,000
jaw caused by stress so if you're losing

165
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,620
your hair it could be because of stress

166
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,080
what you need to do is you need to give

167
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,979
yourself deep massages on your scalp and

168
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,780
you're not going to use your nails

169
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,759
you're going to use like the the pads of

170
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,039
your fingers you're going to put coconut

171
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,440
oil or olive oil and like really

172
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,500
properly massage your scalp and you're

173
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,440
going in an upward motion to kind of um

174
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,000
to give more slack basically improve

175
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,919
your skin quality along your scalp so

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,759
that you don't start losing follicles so

177
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
let me give you the straight of

178
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,580
actionable steps right now so if your

179
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
hair and skin up or in a bad condition

180
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,080
right now like really trash if your hair

181
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,820
is super oily or super dry if your scalp

182
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,120
is super oily or super dry and if you're

183
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,979
a young man just buzz it off

184
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,360
just take a trimmer or go to your Barber

185
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,919
and bust the whole thing off you have

186
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,840
nothing to lose and then you can start

187
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,759
fixing your body fixing your health

188
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,620
fixing your scalp Etc and when your hair

189
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
grows Anew it's going to be the best

190
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,740
hair you've had and if you don't want to

191
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
do that that's fine still follow the

192
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,680
rest of the protocol so you're going to

193
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,020
quit shampoo and conditioner cold turkey

194
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,699
right just stop using it hey boys so I'm

195
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,100
in the field a couple days oh but I had

196
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,360
to make this quick video so my editor

197
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,979
Jackie brought up an interesting point

198
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
which is once you stop using shampoo

199
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,820
what happens is your hair doesn't

200
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,979
magically get better it actually gets

201
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,319
worse it gets worse for the first two or

202
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,759
three weeks maybe even four weeks before

203
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,500
actually improving

204
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,720
so be aware of that so the way it works

205
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,120
is you know everybody needs sometimes to

206
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,340
reset from the

207
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,319
cycle that the shampoo has created oh

208
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,759
yeah so quick tip if you're out in the

209
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,560
field like you're gonna be using a lot

210
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,440
of energy and you're gonna be outdoors

211
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,840
honey highly energy dense highly

212
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,919
nutrition dense I literally had honey

213
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,100
for breakfast

214
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,319
it works you can absolutely and you

215
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,940
should use just water to wash your hair

216
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
so you can actually do this even every

217
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,419
day if you wanted to to move the water

218
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
around your scalp and give yourself a

219
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,960
scalp massage as you're getting water on

220
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,039
your scalp without using shampoo or

221
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,440
conditioner and that's going to remove

222
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,360
the dust and pollen and pollutants while

223
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,160
not removing the oils which are actually

224
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,740
required for nourishing your hair but

225
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,900
note that you must have a shower filter

226
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,759
installed this is a non-negotiable

227
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,680
unless you know for a fact that your

228
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,660
water quality is super high I guarantee

229
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,580
you if you live in any major city your

230
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,099
water quality is trash it's full of

231
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,660
hormones it's full of chlorine which is

232
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,340
going to be very damaging for your scalp

233
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,020
and you definitely need to install a

234
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,280
shower filter in order to filter it out

235
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,900
I'll link in the description to the one

236
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,819
which I use so you're free to use water

237
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,800
to rinse off any number of times a week

238
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,419
and probably once a week or maybe twice

239
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,280
a week if you're living a very congested

240
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,099
and polluted city you'll want to use a

241
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,099
non-toxic shampoo or what I use is

242
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,199
actually a olive soap so this thing is a

243
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,419
olive soap so it's made of olive oil

244
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,860
basically and it does the job of

245
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,240
removing the pollen and pollutants and

246
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,039
everything but it doesn't strip away the

247
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,479
oils but even then I just use it once a

248
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
week and I'll link to the description I

249
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
even have a discount code for this

250
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,880
actually I got the discount code way

251
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,139
back during my skincare video and the

252
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,759
same company which makes the skin care

253
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,160
products which is like Tallow bomb which

254
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,139
I use makes the soap so very trustable

255
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,699
company I know the guy who owns it if

256
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,620
you live in the US this is a good option

257
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,240
if you don't live in the US find any

258
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,979
small business in your country which

259
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
makes similar products that's the good

260
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,900
thing about living in 2023 is that we're

261
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,879
starting to see the glimmer of hope you

262
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,560
know you're starting to see companies we

263
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
just started just by normal people like

264
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,919
you and me who are simply sick and tired

265
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,300
of the mega corporations creating toxic

266
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,220
products which actually cause the

267
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,199
problem which they purport to solve and

268
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,180
instead start small businesses which

269
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
produce genuine good products I'm

270
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,419
telling you if you're an entrepreneur or

271
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,820
you want to start a small business this

272
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,440
is the time this is the perfect time you

273
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,419
see this is the gold rush you know

274
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,860
people are starting to realize that the

275
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,820
mainstream products are trash and

276
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,560
they're starting to adopt

277
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,240
non-traditional products if you start

278
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,339
your company right now and if you're

279
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,740
selling anything like literally soap

280
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,839
shampoo sunscreen so many products that

281
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,640
we use day to day are toxic so if you

282
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,560
are the guy to make non-toxic version

283
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,300
which is still effective and completely

284
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,339
safe your business is gonna grow

285
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,019
massively exponentially in the next 10

286
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,940
years so basically let me quickly

287
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,920
summarize the way you wash your hair is

288
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,300
you use just water every day or every

289
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,160
other day it doesn't matter and then

290
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,200
every once a week you're using non-toxic

291
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,120
shampoo that does exist they are

292
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,220
non-toxic shampoos out there or you use

293
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,420
in Olive soap like how I do and I'll

294
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,399
link in the description to the products

295
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,899
which I use or I approve of and after

296
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,580
washing your hair you're still going to

297
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,140
lose some of the oils so here's what you

298
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,540
can do this depends on your specific

299
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,940
needs I personally use a single drop of

300
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,140
olive oil I'll spread it along my palms

301
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,700
and then I'll just run it through my

302
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,140
hair you can also use coconut oil but

303
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,760
the problem with coconut oil is if you

304
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,080
live in a cold climate the coconut oil

305
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
is going to solidify and it's going to

306
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,380
be gross so olive oil is the way to go

307
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
for me and for some of you you may not

308
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,800
need any oil because your scalp already

309
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,000
produces enough so you have to kind of

310
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
experiment and find out what works for

311
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,800
you after you run oil through your hair

312
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,540
you use a wooden comb you have to use

313
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,500
wood you cannot use your plastic Combs

314
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,820
because otherwise you leech micro

315
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,440
Plastics into your scalp so you're going

316
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,300
to use a wooden comb it has these wooden

317
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,620
bristles and you'll run it through your

318
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,180
hair and this is going to kind of

319
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,220
stimulate the follicles it's going to

320
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,019
increase blood flow on your scalp very

321
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,060
good if you're having hair loss this is

322
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,220
a must and lastly don't use hot water

323
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
use lukewarm or body temperature water

324
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,519
and of course we're going to talk about

325
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,500
dandruff so most people don't have

326
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,540
dandruff most people have freaking dry

327
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,459
scalp which looks like dandruff but it's

328
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,019
not the same thing if you have genuinely

329
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,459
you have dandruff then yeah you might

330
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,560
need to see a medical professional but

331
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,720
most people have dry scalp which is

332
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,519
caused by shampoo like I said before so

333
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,019
do what I said and you'll most people

334
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
will solve their problems because most

335
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,019
people don't have dandruff but if you

336
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,339
still have problems you know after a

337
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,620
month of following this protocol then

338
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,120
yeah perhaps you do have actual skin

339
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,980
condition called dandruff and you can

340
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,839
actually go to a dermatologist any

341
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,580
YouTuber who wants to talk about Hair

342
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
Care without talking about diet doesn't

343
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,740
know what the hell he's talking about

344
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,140
like in the start of the video I said

345
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,899
that hair is an indicator of health so

346
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,700
if your gen newly unhealthy even if you

347
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,320
follow this protocol even if you buy the

348
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,000
most expensive products you are not

349
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
going to have good hair good hair starts

350
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,440
from genuine good health and I mean

351
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,120
hormonal health I mean physical health I

352
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,980
also mean mental health like I said

353
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
before stress has an effect on hair loss

354
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,220
so for diet I'm going to make it super

355
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,899
simple for you this is not a diet video

356
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,820
as such but I have to point it out

357
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,700
otherwise this video makes no sense so

358
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,860
first thing eat animal protein eggs red

359
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,779
meat white meat fish so long as it's

360
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,399
well sourced I'm talking about grass-fed

361
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,920
grass finish I'm talking about local

362
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,420
farms buying high quality meat high

363
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,459
quality eggs and your hair is going to

364
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,920
improve even if you continue to use [ __ ]

365
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,959
shampoo next thing is Omega fatty acids

366
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,339
right so Omega-3s omega-6s the problem

367
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,620
with this is because most of our water

368
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,839
is polluted most fish have microplastics

369
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,600
in them which means most cod liver oil

370
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,180
has microplastics and on top of that

371
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,140
Omega-3s and omega-6s are

372
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,700
polyunsaturated fatty acids which means

373
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,380
they're unstable and because they're

374
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,820
unstable if you don't know if the

375
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,440
company doesn't know how to store them

376
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
properly or doesn't care enough to store

377
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,740
them properly you're actually going to

378
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,600
be doing more harm by consuming these

379
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,880
supplements than not so most drugstore

380
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,500
or you know CVS brand Omega-3

381
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,300
supplements cod liver oil supplements

382
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,440
they are trash the only one which I

383
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,240
actually trust is a very interesting

384
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,040
product it's a blend of cod liver oil

385
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
and butter oil it's made by this company

386
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,820
called Green pasture and I trust them

387
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
because they work with vintage tradition

388
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,060
and I know that vintage tradition is

389
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,620
good so I'll link to that company in the

390
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,839
description next thing Vitamin D

391
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,700
supplements are mostly trash sunlight is

392
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,440
the absolute King and actually you may

393
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,420
not know this but vitamin D is not

394
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,920
exactly a vitamins more like a hormone

395
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,019
than a vitamin so looking at it from

396
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,540
that perspective your skin is the

397
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,640
largest endocrine organ in your body so

398
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,920
make sure you get your sunlight get sun

399
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,260
exposure on as much skin as possible

400
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,700
even on cloudy days this is what I'm

401
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,620
talking about this is going to improve

402
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,820
your Genuine Health like literally

403
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
genuinely you're going to be more

404
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,600
healthy person and that's going to

405
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,399
result in better hair and then hydration

406
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,899
hydration is key because it brings the

407
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,399
nutrients to the scalp in the first

408
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,899
place and hydration is not simply

409
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,459
drinking a lot of water there's a whole

410
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,560
science behind the electric lights and

411
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,480
the balances Etc in order to be hydrated

412
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,100
so what's my hydration guide to get

413
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,500
properly hydrated and then of course

414
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,240
sleep sleep is an absolute must sleep

415
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,399
also genuinely improves your health

416
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,560
which causes your hair to be better and

417
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,360
to optimize your sleep I have a whole

418
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,620
sleep optimization video so that's the

419
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,180
one you need to watch and also a few

420
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,740

421
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,260
