1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,240
all right boys today we are going to

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,600
prepare the legendary Lord of pepper

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
chicken in 5 minutes of preparation and

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,639
just 25 minutes in the oven you can

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,080
prepare 300 G of high quality protein

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,880
it's easy to eat easy to prepare easy to

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,279
store easy to heat up after cooking this

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
is for men who just don't have the time

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,640
for complex recipes when it comes to

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,760
chicken we have only five options

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,279
chicken breast thighs drumsticks wings

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,519
and the whole leg I don't like chicken

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,079
breasts because it doesn't have a lot of

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,760
fat which means it doesn't have a lot of

15
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,360
flavor which means the cooking process

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,160
to prepare good chicken breast is just

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,520
more complicated doesn't taste that good

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
anyway and the fat is a feature not a

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,280
bug so I actually want fat so chicken

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,920
breast off the table chicken wings it

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,399
it's like a bunch of work for not that

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
much reward cuz there's not much meat on

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,520
the wings anyway so I don't use chicken

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
wings that leaves us with drumsticks

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,440
that leaves us with thighs and whole

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,000
legs whole legs is just thighs plus

27
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,239
drumsticks so just get the whole legs

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,559
why is this is because is it's cheaper

29
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,239
per pound it's the same nutrition value

30
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,320
but it's cheaper per pound because there

31
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,240
one less uh manufacturing step or like

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,920
processing step really so whole legs is

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,759
the superior cut of chicken just always

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,479
get whole legs easy always get them to

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,000
the skin on because the skin is

36
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,400
nutritious the skin has essentially it

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
has collagen and other micronutrients

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,439
that are good for your own skin so you

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,479
want the skin on not just for that

40
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,360
reason but also because once you put it

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,640
through the oven it's going to crisp up

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,000
and the crispy chicken skin tastes

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,600
amazing so skin on always and of course

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,320
you know that not all chicken is created

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
equal we don't want to consume the

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,079
chickens that are kept in those little

47
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,000
cages or are in these cooped indoor

48
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,000
environments these have a lot of

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,240
antibiotic load because of the stress

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,680
and strain they're subjected to because

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,920
of their um environment essentially so

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
what do we do we look for pasture raised

53
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,439
if you see better chicken project or

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Animal Welfare certified you can be sure

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,200
that this is some high quality chicken

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
and if you have more questions about

57
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,640
labels just put them in the comments

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,320
foods like this whole foods that aren't

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,160
too different from what our ancestors

60
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,840
ate is what I use to build up my body

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
relatively quickly this is what I looked

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,160
like posts surgery last year and these

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,280
are my latest gym progress photos

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,040
nutrition is of course one of the three

65
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,360
pillars of hormone optimized training

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,360
and this cannot be compromised to do

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,319
this recipe you need a few spices you

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,400
need a few seasonings all of which which

69
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,640
are easy to get in any grocery store

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,519
most people really think too much about

71
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,840
the salt they use but the truth is the

72
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,480
salt you use has a huge impact on the

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,599
flavor of the cooking in fact when I was

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
at the Austin growth house last year one

75
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,840
of the members Steven actually said that

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
he had the best steak he's ever had in

77
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,640
his life which I prepared for all the

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,959
boys and it wasn't because I'm some kind

79
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,720
of amazing Michelin store cook it was

80
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,959
because I was using high quality salt

81
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,159
and most people don't know anything

82
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,360
about salt so what is highquality salt

83
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,560
you can get Celtic Sea salt you can get

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Peruvian salt or if you want the

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,840
absolute best microplastic free spring

86
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,560
salt you can get Vera salt then you need

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,280
the spices you need ground black pepper

88
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,519
you need crushed Rosemary you need thyme

89
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,280
you need onion powder garlic powder and

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,200
grounded Ginger basically the onion

91
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,360
garlic and ground ginger are kind of

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,319
support and boost the flavor of the

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,360
pepper and the rosemary thyme they add a

94
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,560
kind of aromatic uh frag

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,799
and freshness to the recipe But first

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,760
you need some cooking fat and you can

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:43,519
use butter like this carry gold I have

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,519
here or you can choose to use duck fat

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,080
now I'm going to coat this these chicken

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,599
legs up with a duck fat which means I

101
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,319
need to I need to remove this ring which

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,439
has gotten a bit stuck and I also need

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,400
to remove my legendary Seiko alpinist

104
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,560
don't want that to get dirty I am going

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,519
to open this up by the way boys if you

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,799
have duck fat or lard or Tallow once you

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,519
open it you do need to keep it in the

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
fridge it's just going to last way

109
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,519
longer so what you do is don't be afraid

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,840
to get get your hands dirty get some of

111
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,079
the duck fat put it on your palm it's

112
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,520
going to melt under the body

113
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,919
temperature and once it has you're just

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,440
going to apply it on the chicken uh

115
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,840
whole chicken legs just make a nice even

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,919
coat

117
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,360
and just move them around so the thing

118
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:39,120
about chicken is chicken actually has a

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,720
much higher and food contamination risk

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
than red meat like beef does you need to

121
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,840
be careful when you you're dealing with

122
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,199
chicken because you don't want to touch

123
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,800
the raw chicken and then touch other

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,080
things if you do you're just increasing

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,520
the chance of getting some terrible

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,240
illness so why is that right let's talk

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,759
about that um

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,919
simply the simple answer is this

129
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,560
chickens are

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,800
smaller so what's going on because a

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,160
chicken is smaller there's a higher

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,080
there's a the digestive tract of the

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,919
chicken is closer to the actual meat

134
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,919
that you consume so think about a cow

135
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,319
think about a large animal like a cow a

136
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,759
lot of the meat is coming from places

137
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,039
which are not in close proximity to the

138
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,680
digestive tract that digestive tract is

139
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,680
where a lot of the eoli and other

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,360
bacteria live so in case of chicken it's

141
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,759
there's a high likelihood that the

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,960
bacteria can jump from the digestive

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,400
tract onto the whole chicken legs which

144
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,000
is why we want to be careful but in

145
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,319
terms of red meat you can theoretically

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm not saying you should do this you

147
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,680
can have red meat raw and that the

148
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,160
reason why red meat raw can work but raw

149
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,039
chicken meat cannot work is because of

150
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,759
the size of the animal and the proximity

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
of the digestive tract to the actual

152
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,680
muscle meat that you're consuming but

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,319
let's get back into this chicken recipe

154
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,880
I said that this recipe can be used to

155
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,160
get 300 g of protein I should be clear

156
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,840
about this so this recipe like what I

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,720
have right now is 150 g of protein but I

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,440
can just double up so I have two whole

159
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,240
legs right here but this this 12in

160
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,199
Skillet 12in cast iron skillet does have

161
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,720
enough room for two more and I've made

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
that before I just I'm not choosing to

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
make it right now because for the

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,199
purpose of the video this would be

165
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,950
faster so two legs 150 g of protein four

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:40,360
legs would be 300 of

167
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:43,160
[Music]

168
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,240
protein now what I'm going to do is just

169
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,880
knead all these spices and herbs into

170
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,199
the chicken here's an important

171
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,560
information that I need to give you the

172
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,759
oven so for long time I just didn't know

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
how to use the oven it's like there's so

174
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,240
many settings I didn't want to

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
understand how to use it and it was just

176
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,160
a pain in the ass so I just never

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,919
invested the time to learn it but oven

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,080
cooking is actually the easiest and best

179
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,319
because you can just make so much food

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,319
for no effort so here's I'm going to

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,800
show you the tricks I'm going to show

182
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,199
you the things which I've learned over

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,680
the years and now you don't have to

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,039
spend the same time and effort to learn

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,879
it so I'm going to show at this point

186
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,000
how to use the oven and this is kind of

187
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,000
my setup so I'm going to have to move

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,120
this chair so OB obviously everybody's

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
oven is going to be different but the

190
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,520
basics are still going to be the same

191
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,280
every oven is going to have a broil

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,879
setting going to hit this until it goes

193
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,080
to low and I want you to understand

194
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,160
where the element of the oven is so you

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,400
know where to adjust the the rack let

196
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,879
going open this

197
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,919
up so check this out in the oven right

198
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,159
the element is on the top which means

199
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,919
that the top of the oven is going to be

200
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,440
the hottest part of the oven so if I

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,440
have this rack all the way at this

202
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,159
setting then the food is going to be so

203
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,639
close to the element that it's going to

204
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,960
CH it's going to burn and it's going to

205
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,840
throw oil into the element and that's

206
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,919
going to cause a lot of smoke and might

207
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,680
even cause a fire so we never want to

208
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,759
use the setting we want to have the the

209
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,360
rack one 2 3 the third setting from the

210
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,400
top which will be perfect for this

211
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,240
recipe so there's there's different ways

212
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,080
to use the oven right the broil setting

213
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,319
what the hell is even the broil setting

214
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,039
so what is an oven how does it work

215
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,360
what's broil and what's bake so baking

216
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,240
in the oven is the the oven is set to a

217
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,159
certain temperature and it uses a

218
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,080
thermostat to maintain that temperature

219
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,880
so if you set 400° F it's going to get

220
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,080
the oven to 400° F and it's going to

221
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,560
keep it there that's one way of cooking

222
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,240
and that works great broil is different

223
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,360
broil does not have a set temperature Bo

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,959
broil just means that the element is

225
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,120
always going to be on so if you set low

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,760
broil it's going to it's going to set

227
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,959
itself to low and just stay on

228
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,120
throughout so what's the difference

229
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,959
between B bake and broil bake the

230
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,240
element is not always on

231
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,120
so once it gets the temperature to 400 c

232
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,279
not 400 F or whatever you set it at it

233
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,480
just turns on when that temperature

234
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,760
Falls below the set temperature like a

235
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,480
thermostat in fact it is a thermostat so

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,000
when the thermostat triggers the element

237
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,920
turns on but with broil the element is

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,320
always on so it's different cooking

239
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,680
techniques I could use the bake function

240
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,720
for this but it takes too long so I

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,959
instead I use the broil function because

242
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,600
the heat output of the element

243
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,320
is continuous and it Cooks the meat

244
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,440
faster so now you understand a little

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,880
bit of the the physics behind how this

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
equipment works and you can use it can

247
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,360
use better so what we do now we just

248
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,160
need to wait for the oven to heat up it

249
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,839
will take about 5 minutes and then we'll

250
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,640
get back into it now the oven's heating

251
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,320
up going to put the guy

252
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,040
into the top rack close her up and set

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
the timer

254
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,839
to 15

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
minutes at 15 minutes we flip it and

256
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:06,480
then set it for another 10

257
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,720
minutes all right boys it's been 15

258
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,200
minutes let's take her out and see what

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,120
she looks like oh got this the steam

260
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,760
steam Rising all right let's check

261
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,519
it okay looks good you can see some

262
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,279
initial Browning on the top which is

263
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:29,680
exactly what we'd expect I to flip her

264
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,200
over but to do that I need some Tong

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,200
and she

266
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,440
goes let's

267
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,240
check all right looks done maybe but'll

268
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,560
have to verify and how we check well I'm

269
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,519
going to switch my camera I'm going to

270
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,839
slice into the thickest part of it that

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
I can

272
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,839
find and let's see

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,200
so it looks to me like it's done so

274
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,040
let's see I'm cutting all the way to the

275
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,040
Bone and what are we going to see you

276
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
going to tell us if it's cooked or

277
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,959
not all right now it should be

278
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,639
completely done that is a completely

279
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,440
ready to go beautiful lot of pepper

280
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,120
chicken now it it's has too hot to taste

281
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,399
test right now so we'll come back to it

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,480
once it's cooled down in fact you want

283
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,839
to allow this chicken to cool down in

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,880
its own juices because it it kind of

285
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,399
reabsorbs some of it and retains some of

286
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,320
the moisture and as the chicken has

287
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:53,839
reached completion so it has the quinoa

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,480
look at that it's nice and fluffy has

289
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,200
not stuck to the bottom of the vessel

290
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,680
exactly how we want it

291
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,519
so how does it taste the quinoa tastes

292
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,600
light and Airy and the chicken the meat

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,320
is Juicy and fresh their skin is crispy

294
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,880
and peppery overall amazing nutritional

295
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,880
