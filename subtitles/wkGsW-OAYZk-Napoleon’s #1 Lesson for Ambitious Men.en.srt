1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,600
jump into the real story of Napoleon and

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,000
see what we can learn from him first I

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,240
want to make it clear that yes I am

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,800
absolutely idolizing him and yes I am

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,480
sweeping under the rug the hundreds of

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
thousands of deaths that he caused

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,000
that's because I'm using Napoleon as a

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,760
dactic instrument just as plutar did and

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,119
yes this would be considered hero

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,400
worship what of it you want to fill your

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,880
mind with Spirits greater than yourself

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,560
with thoughts of men who are greater

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,679
than you you do not want to fill your

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
head with thoughts of nobody's in our

15
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,519
time and indeed even these men of

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,879
history chose their own role models from

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,840
history Caesar looked up to Alexander

18
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,640
and Napoleon looked up to Caesar these

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,960
are men that Define their entire Epoch

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,800
and I use the acts and mindset of these

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
men as my shining star when Caesar was

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,680
outnumbered in Gaul when he was

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,680
surrounded on all sides did he give up

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,960
or did he rise to the occasion creating

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840
new Battlefield tactics in order to make

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,440
the best of the situation Caesar used

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,000
his mind his tactical Brilliance and of

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,160
course the blessings of the Goddess

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,480
Fortuna to bring Victory to his people

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,200
when Napoleon was facing two entire

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,320
armies at the same time in aitz instead

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,960
of seeing this as a potential disaster

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,360
he saw it as an opportunity he used his

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
understanding of the environment and the

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,320
terrain to bring death to his foes it's

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,720
not the big flashy victories either

37
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,799
before the Battle of I think fredland

38
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,200
Napoleon was known to be in his tent

39
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,240
planning education reforms on the eve of

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,119
battle imagine how crazy this is the man

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,159
had a real ability to detach we in our

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,960
modern times we freak out if there's an

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,920
exam the next day an exam which is

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,399
completely forgotten about a year from

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
now something as Petty as an exam has

46
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,360
the power to stress us and this man he

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,520
had a whole battle to fight the next day

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
and he still had the mental bandwidth to

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,000
focus on a different task this is what

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,759
is meant by Detachment the ability to

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,159
look upon the battlefield from above and

52
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,240
make the tactically just Choice based on

53
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,320
logic and reason alone these are some of

54
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,000
the lessons that we can learn from

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,840
Napoleon not just focus on his sexual

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,159
deviances In Our Lifetime a suspect that

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
that an American Napoleon an American

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
Caesar will be born and I'm not even

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,920
saying that's a good thing indeed he

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,520
would be a nemesis of the status quo he

61
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,879
might already be born he might be

62
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,000
watching this video right now I believe

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,480
this because the conditions are ripe for

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,560
a Napoleon or a Caesar to arise the land

65
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,760
is fertile for such a man to arise on

66
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,080
American soil it might be you if you are

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,959
up to it and I'll leave you with some

68
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,959
further reading if you're so inclined if

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,879
you enjoyed the Aesthetics and the

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
Romance of the French Revolution period

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,560
I strongly suggest Alexander Dumas The

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
Count of Monte Christo this is a

73
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,160
brilliant book and the complexity of the

74
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,400
plot is insane this is the story of a

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,760
young lad named Edmund Dantes and he's a

76
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,599
just a young wholesome young man who

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
wants to live his life create his

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,120
business have a wife and go about his

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,120
day but he is betrayed by his closest

80
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,680
friends and allies and he's thrown into

81
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,560
prison for trumped up charges for 20

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,440
years but when he returns he's a changed

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,360
man so he has a mentor in prison who

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
teaches science intuition observation

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,959
and philosophy and when he comes out

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,360
he's able to use that to build an Empire

87
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,680
and fight a multigenerational war

88
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,680
against his betrayers really cool and
