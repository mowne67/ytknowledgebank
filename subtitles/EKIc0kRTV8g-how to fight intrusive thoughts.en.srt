1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,600
I have four tiny sentences in my brain

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,919
that trigger automatically to reset my

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,280
thought pattern make me more present and

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,400
delete anxiety in my daily life this

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
video is about the voice in your head

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,040
there's a voice in your head which is

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,840
the internal monologue the internal

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
narrator this is the voice you hear when

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,680
you're reading a book this is the voice

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
which you debate with and this is the

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,800
voice which helps you making complex

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
decisions to my surprise some people

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,279
don't even have this voice and not to my

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,640
surprise most people have a terrible

15
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,680
relationship with this voice but a few

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
people do have a good relationship with

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,200
this voice use it as a tool and as a

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,600
partner to make better decisions and

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,000
think through complex ideas and in

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,360
general improve the quality of their

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
life I going to help you join this

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,680
special group most people don't know

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,719
this but your relationship with that

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,879
internal voice that mind voice is a key

25
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,960
driver in your happiness and well-being

26
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,960
but also your attractiveness and even

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,600
your productivity at this point we can

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
agree that happiness doesn't coming from

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,559
having the most money the most most

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
number of cars the most number of

31
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,839
 or anything like this but at the

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
same time we not ready to give up

33
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,799
everything go and live in a monastery

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,479
and live in complete seclusion we need a

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,000
functional mindfulness a kind of

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,680
meditation a kind of mindfulness that is

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,439
with you throughout the day as

38
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,680
responsible for destroying negative

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,119
thoughts without taking us off our focus

40
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,759
into actually achieving the things that

41
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,479
we want to achieve many YouTubers have

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,000
talked about the Flow State a state in

43
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,360
which your mind kind of goes blank

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,920
you're completely in the conscious

45
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,479
you're working really hard at your

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,640
project or maybe you're doing physical

47
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,399
activities like a sport this is not

48
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,360
about that this is a functional

49
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,880
mindfulness while you're not meditating

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,759
you're not in a flow State you're just

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,240
going about your regular life many

52
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,880
people even very wise people assume that

53
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,119
the voice in the head is kind of an

54
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
enemy kind of something which you need

55
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,560
to suppress or delete in order to live a

56
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,560
fulfilling life I don't see it this way

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
I see it as a tool as an ally as a

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
partner but that being said it's not

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,880
your Ally and you don't really control

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,719
it like a tool if you ever had trouble

61
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,399
sleeping because of racing thoughts you

62
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,920
know exactly what I mean literally I

63
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,880
dealt with this for years I would lie

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,719
down ready to sleep I did my nighttime

65
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,799
routine and everything and I couldn't

66
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,000
fall asleep because the voice in my head

67
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,720
would be saying that if I didn't get

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
good sleep tonight then the next day is

69
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,920
going to suck and the weird thing the

70
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
irony is I would have been able to sleep

71
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,599
if my voice wasn't cycling and reminding

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,160
me of how my life was going to be

73
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,360
if I couldn't sleep it was completely

74
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,840
dysfunctional this is an example of a

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
maladaptive voice in your mind but it

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,640
doesn't have to be like this there's

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,280
amazing book called the happiness

78
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,200
hypothesis by Jonathan ha who's a friend

79
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,319
of Jordan Peterson he talks about how

80
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,680
the subconscious mind is vast like an

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,920
elephant and you're like the rider on

82
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,879
the neck of the elephant technically the

83
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,959
rider is in control of the elephant but

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
any given time the elephant could just

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,120
take him put him on the ground and stomp

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,480
him this metaphor is actually quite good

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
because that is how a rider really rides

88
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,640
an elephant the rider of an elephant

89
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
must have a good relationship with the

90
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
elephant the elephant has to trust him

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,360
plus he needs to have the the skills of

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,440
his trade and the tools of his trade in

93
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,640
order to actually control his elephant

94
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,280
in this video I'm going to give you the

95
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
tools to take your subconsciousness from

96
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,920
an enemy to your friend I'm going to

97
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,760
give you a total of just four very short

98
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
sentences and I'm going to teach you how

99
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
to train your mind to use these

100
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
sentences the way it works for me

101
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,480
because I've been training it for years

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,360
at this point is when my mind falls into

103
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
a rabbit hole into a vicious cycle one

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,879
of these thoughts will automatically

105
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
trigger and break me out of the cycle

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,959
the first one of these magic sentences

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,640
is stop and let it go and I say this in

108
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,080
my mind in a kind of like a humorous

109
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,239
light-hearted manner you know stop and

110
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,760
let it go and this plays in my mind

111
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,480
whenever I get stuck or I'm hung up on

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,319
something from the past I regret from

113
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,000
the past for example there was this one

114
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,120
Hazel eyed girl who I fumbled years ago

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,280
at this point but I still have hangups

116
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,840
and regrets about this so whenever I do

117
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,239
catch myself thinking about that and you

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
know what I could have done different or

119
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,159
something like this immediately my mind

120
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
will come up with the thought just stop

121
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,720
and let it go go cuz you know I can't do

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,840
anything about that anymore that ship

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,200
has sailed so all I can do right now is

124
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,079
stop and let it go before I give you

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,920
these other three sentences I want you

126
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,560
to understand how this works I didn't

127
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,159
come up with all these four sentences at

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
the same time and I didn't practice them

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,359
all at the same time I did one at a time

130
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,120
depending on what was necessary in my

131
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,880
life at a time in my life in which I was

132
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,600
really really hung up about this girl I

133
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,120
would practice stop and let it go of

134
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,400
course it doesn't only work for that one

135
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,280
situation it works for multiple

136
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,479
situations but it was created for that

137
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,919
purpose if you have constant hangups

138
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
about the past whether it's a girl or

139
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,199
something else it doesn't matter you'll

140
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,919
just hit it with stop and let it go and

141
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,880
if you practice this enough times it

142
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,199
becomes automatic and whenever you find

143
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,800
yourself in that recurring rabbit hole

144
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,280
that recurring never- ending cycle a

145
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,919
vicious cycle your mind will

146
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,120
automatically trigger that sentence stop

147
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,280
and let it go and your mind will simply

148
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,320
detach you'll be back to the present and

149
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,320
you'll be able to reassess and then you

150
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,320
know move on to other things this is a

151
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
huge benefit to to mental health I don't

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,759
know why more people don't talk about

153
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
this but if your problem isn't getting

154
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
hung up on the things of the past but

155
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,560
rather it's hyper optimizing the present

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,880
and the next sentence is for you the

157
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,639
next sentence is a question it's do I

158
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,479
care and the tone of this is kind of

159
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,240
dismissive it's like do I care and I use

160
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,520
this when the circumstances I'm in are

161
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
not ideal to my perfect standards for

162
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,759
example if I go to the gym and I haven't

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
brought my water bottle you know so it's

164
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,840
not perfect I can still work out but

165
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
it's not perfect in situations like this

166
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,479
my brain instead of making this into a

167
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,759
big deal instead of overthinking it I'll

168
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,600
just hit it with do I care and quite

169
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
often I don't care so I'll finish my

170
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
workout regardless and then go about my

171
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,960
day if you're the kind of person who

172
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,639
overthinks trivial inconveniences this

173
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,759
is an important sentence for you and

174
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,479
this works amazingly well in social

175
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,080
situations for example if you make an

176
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,840
edgy joke around people who aren't

177
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,199
really your friends and you're later

178
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
you're thinking about like how you

179
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,960
shouldn't have made that joke and nobody

180
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,000
really laughed and you're feeling kind

181
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,120
of cringe kind of discomfort from that

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,639
memory of the past hit it with do I care

183
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,800
and the fact of the matter is I don't

184
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,600
care about the opinions of most people

185
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,759
so there's absolutely zero reason why I

186
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,080
should be hung up about cringe things or

187
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
uncomfortable things which I've done or

188
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
said in the past in front of these

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,680
people I don't care so I ask myself the

190
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,599
question do I care and if I don't then

191
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,240
it's an easy way to let it go so this is

192
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,440
also something which I practice in order

193
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,840
to be less socially anxious you need to

194
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,639
be able to recover from situations in

195
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
which you are kind of socially awkward

196
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,560
so if I ever get a memory of myself

197
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,840
being socially awkward do I care and of

198
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,680
I don't care so I move on pretty easily

199
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
understand this these sub routines right

200
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
these special sentences which I'm giving

201
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,560
you for me they trigger automatically as

202
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,000
soon as I get caught in a trap if I'm

203
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,120
overthinking about this awkward thing

204
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,160
which I made automatically the thought

205
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,639
will pop in my head do I care and I let

206
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,440
go of the burden I'll get let go of That

207
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,720
Awkward thought and this is hugely

208
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,479
beneficial for my overall well-being and

209
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,759
just happiness in general the next

210
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,039
sentence is what is done is done and

211
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,840
this is said with a tone of arrogance

212
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,720
and finality it's like what is done is

213
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,039
done and you use this when you're

214
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,560
thinking about decisions which weren't

215
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,000
optimal what I mean is if you have ever

216
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,639
made decisions and you found that your

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,400
decisions weren't perfect which

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,960
everybody has made bad decisions and

219
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,039
you're constantly having thoughts of I

220
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,240
should have done this because of this or

221
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,360
I should have done this cuz I should

222
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,479
have known better Etc then you got to

223
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,720
hit it with what's done is done the

224
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,039
truth of the matter is quite often it's

225
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,479
better to make a bad decision than not

226
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,520
making a decision at all in fact they

227
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,919
teach this to every single army officer

228
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,280
serve across time and across space from

229
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,319
the Cavalry commanders of Napoleon to US

230
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,680
Marine Corps every single officer is

231
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
taught that sometimes you just got to

232
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
make a decision and then work with it

233
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,400
rather than just sat there and getting

234
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
shot at so everybody has made bad

235
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,440
decisions that's fine you have to rise

236
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
about the occasion and keep moving and

237
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
making new decisions because that old

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,240
decision is already gone that fork in

239
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,199
the road has already been crossed you

240
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,759
cannot look back and be hung up on

241
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
things because that's actually a worse

242
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,120
position just moving on and making new

243
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
and better decisions so you got to hit

244
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,159
bad decisions which you've made which

245
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,680
you're having regrets about with what's

246
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,759
done is done Own It move forward another

247
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,400
use for what's done is done is when you

248
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,280
know you have to do something but it has

249
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,000
a strong level of resistance or

250
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,440
uncomfortableness while going through it

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,199
for example when I made my video the

252
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,879
anti- addiction video the video which

253
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,280
teaches you how to break free from porn

254
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,440
addiction forever it was a very awkward

255
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,319
video for me to post I knew the video

256
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,639
was good in fact I think it's the best

257
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
video on this topic on the planet and I

258
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
say this with zero arrogance I say this

259
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
with knowing the facts of my trade I

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,599
still felt quite uncomfortable releasing

261
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
that into the public because think about

262
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,360
it do I want to be talking about such a

263
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,800
sensitive topic and this can be searched

264
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,480
you know as this available on Google

265
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,640
people can find this so it's a highly

266
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,760
awkward decision to make but I knew what

267
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,800
I must do I knew it had to be done so I

268
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,320
found myself kind of catastrophizing you

269
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,000
know I was I found myself kind of hung

270
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,920
up on this I wasn't able to click the

271
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,279
make public button on the back end of

272
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,160
YouTube so finally I decided my moral

273
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,880
and principles are in alignment I should

274
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
just hit the button and then deal with

275
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,800
the consequences so I hit it I've made

276
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,360
that video public what is done is done

277
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,959
and I'll deal with the consequences when

278
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,839
they arise and again I want to remind

279
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,560
you you don't need to practice all these

280
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,320
four sentences at the same time in fact

281
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,519
you shouldn't do that you can only

282
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
practice one sentence in your

283
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,600
subconscious at any given time I'll

284
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,480
write these four sentences in the

285
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,760
description below but you should only

286
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
focus on one at a time find out which

287
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,839
kind of mental block you're facing the

288
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
most which kind of rabbit hole which

289
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,240
kind of endless cycle you're falling

290
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,120
yourself into and then use the correct

291
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,279
sentence for that destroy that

292
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,600
particular thought cycle and then move

293
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,519
on to a different sentence if you need

294
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,279
it and if you don't need all four maybe

295
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,040
you just need two of them that's fine

296
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,320
you have to customize everything which I

297
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,480
give you for your own life circumstances

298
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
and the last sentence is stop and come

299
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
back and this is said with a tone of

300
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
command you're commanding yourself stop

301
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,279
and come back this is used when you're

302
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,880
having cycling thoughts about the future

303
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,680
if youve ever worked in code like you

304
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,640
ever tried to code a program you'll know

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,760
what's an endless loop it's a loop that

306
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,160
you you kind of messed up the

307
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,360
programming a little bit so when you hit

308
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
run the program just runs again and

309
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,920
again and again and again forever and

310
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,279
most programs will have a manual kill

311
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,839
switch as soon as you hit it the program

312
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,600
stops running and then you can fix it

313
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,600
and some programs even have a feature

314
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,320
which if it detects an endless loop

315
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,480
it'll shut down by itself and say you

316
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,079
need to fix this and that's what stop

317
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,839
and come back is for me for my mind

318
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,600
whenever I'm catastrophizing when I'm

319
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,279
making cyclical thoughts about the

320
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,920
future you know this could go wrong

321
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,560
visual call this go wrong this is going

322
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,839
to go wrong this is going to go wrong

323
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm thinking about the future in the

324
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,560
cyclical way that's when I'm hit with

325
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
the Stop and come back so the first

326
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,480
sentence I give you was stop and let it

327
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
go that's about the past when you have

328
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,519
things in the past you can't control it

329
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
because it's already in the past you

330
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,360
stop and let it go when you have

331
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
thoughts about the future you're trying

332
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,279
to figure out what's going to happen in

333
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,959
the future and how best to handle it and

334
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,000
you're just going around in circles you

335
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,360
got to say stop and come back this is

336
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
going to help you break the cycle come

337
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,480
back to the present and then actually

338
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
reassess the situation and then move

339
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,920
forward I suggest that the four

340
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,880
sentences which I've given you use them

341
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,000
exactly word for word I've given you

342
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,480
because if you heard me say those words

343
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,160
so many times in this one video that

344
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,600
they already have a resonance in your

345
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,519
mind they already have some kind of

346
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,160
connection with your subconscious you

347
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,079
might as well just build on those

348
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,079
practice those and use them whenever

349
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
you're having cyclical thoughts what I'm

350
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,720
teaching you is essentially a meditation

351
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
technique called labeling I've taken

352
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,279
that technique and made it more

353
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,639
practical so it say you can use it even

354
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,760
when you're not meditating so what

355
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,800
you're essentially doing like if you

356
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,120
look at what's going on is when you have

357
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,880
a cyclical thought pattern your mind

358
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,399
instantly recognizes that labels it and

359
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,639
as soon as you label it it becomes

360
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,480
powerless and inefficient and so you can

361
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,079
keep it aside and then you can get back

362
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,839
to actually what you're doing do this

363
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,639
enough times and the labeling process

364
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,639
