1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,599
so five years you're gonna spend five

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,880
years with Rags instead of good clothes

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,559
not meeting any women because quite

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,940
honestly if you're doing this then women

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,279
don't want to talk to you anyway and

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,760
cutting your own hair to save money yo

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,760
that's dumb

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,800
the only guy who'll sell his supplements

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,279
in his ebook before the video even

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,640
starts the perfect male timeline exact

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,640
systems

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,120
step by step doing the right things at

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,079
the right time to have the perfect male

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,840
life

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,180
yo living your life as a step-by-step

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
process from going A to Z is not a way

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,840
to live a good life I truly believe that

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,460
male life is all about timing and that's

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
exactly your life is not all about

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,719
timing life is about what you do with

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
the time that you're given from 25 to 35

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,960
you need to pretty much give up women

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,059
the majority of your social life you

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,739
need to have an exact routine and stick

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,840
to it for 10 years be dedicated to one

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,060
idea

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,119
give up your social life give up women

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,920
give up everything for 10 years of your

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,880
life in order to do what you know you

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,380
might want to rise up to a top level

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,760
management job with a six figure salary

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,280
and you think once I get there I'm mate

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,960
okay so that might so from ages 25 to 30

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,580
you dedicate everything that you have

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,439
you sacrifice your friend's Circle you

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,020
sacrifice your social life you sacrifice

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,119
meeting women and then you become the MD

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,460
of a company when you're 35 and you have

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,840
a six figure salary that sounds awful if

40
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,100
you get there if you have a nice bank

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,659
account you have six figure salary and

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,040
you're 35 and you missed out a Whole

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,479
Decade of the best years of your life

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,759
you're going to look back and you would

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,740
swap in a heartbeat all that money to go

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,060
back to 25 and relive that life the

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,680
actual way you know actually have fun

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,060
and do something you know memorable with

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
the best years of your life you could

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,220
you could just be a big stock you got

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,020
all the way up to 35 and then cut some

52
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,240
of the body fat

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,119
what he's suggesting is from the ages 25

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,100
to 35 you just bulk bulk bulk and you

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,840
become this huge stocky guy and then

56
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,640
when you reach 35 then you start cutting

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
I think that's ridiculous that's a

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,820
horrible way to live why would you first

59
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,619
off why do you want to look stocky who

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,899
wants to look stocky anyway you want to

61
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,340
live a healthy Fit Life throughout your

62
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,379
life it's not like when you become 35

63
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,000
suddenly Fitness becomes important I'm

64
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,500
not against bulking but you shouldn't be

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,819
bulking for 10 years you're gonna have

66
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,840
to give up night time you're gonna have

67
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,580
to give thanks

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,319
majority of the time if it lands on your

69
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,840
lap if there's like a straight eight out

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,500
of ten and she's like

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,280
you're gonna waste like two hours of

72
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,920
your life don't do it because that

73
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,940
opportunity might not pop up yeah so for

74
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,260
10 years of your life 24 ages 25 to 35

75
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,819
you're just going to not interact with

76
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,459
women at all unless they interact with

77
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,140
you first that's a terrible idea like by

78
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,060
the end of it when you're 35 and you're

79
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,760
you know the MD of a company and you're

80
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,040
rich you are gonna not have the skills

81
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,840
anymore you know this old 35 year old

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
guy who completely lost touch with

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,780
everything doesn't have social skills no

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,739
no like you have a bank account what are

85
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,180
you gonna do with the bank account you

86
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,980
can't get the affection of women with

87
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,140
just a bank account the most interesting

88
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,760
people in history they experiment they

89
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,440
aren't you know risking and feeling this

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,780
fear of you got to do this this and this

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,239
from ages 25 to 35 and then you can set

92
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
yourself up for Success from 35 to 45.

93
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,920
the interesting people in history don't

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,420
do this they live storied life they go

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,340
and do things which may or may not

96
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,040
succeed what Chris is describing is

97
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,540
actually a cowardly and weak kind of way

98
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,860
of living when you plan everything out

99
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,780
and you think it's going to go perfect

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,879
but it never actually will like think

101
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,340
about Winston Churchill think about the

102
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,379
Lawrence of Arabia these men went out

103
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,060
there and even risked their lives to do

104
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,280
these crazy things because they wanted

105
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,140
to and because it would be an adventure

106
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,459
to do so they didn't sit there planning

107
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,159
their life and you know Investment

108
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,959
Portfolio 25 years to 35 years I got a

109
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,640
bulk from 25 to 35 and then I'll cut and

110
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,260
then I'll look good you have the control

111
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,760
over your life you don't have to time

112
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,500
everything perfectly and if you do try

113
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,659
to time everything perfectly you will

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,459
guaranteed fail

115
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,980
the overlap so on the next one number

116
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,440
three this is from 30 to 35 five years

117
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,640
of Jesus loans it's five years and not

118
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,260
dating any women not seeing any women

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,980
basically necessarily seeing them but

120
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,480
you're not seeing them in that capacity

121
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,459
so five years you're gonna spend five

122
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,799
years with Rags instead of good clothes

123
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,480
not meeting any women because quite

124
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,860
honestly if you're doing this then women

125
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,200
don't want to talk to you anyway and

126
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,700
cutting your own hair to save money man

127
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,199
imagine once you get out of that five

128
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,880
years right when you're ready to start

129
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,440
living your life so to speak your

130
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,820
confidence is going to be trash like you

131
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,680
haven't spoken to girls in five years

132
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,120
you haven't had friends you're wearing

133
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Rags you're cutting your own hair it's

134
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,840
not possible for a human being to just

135
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,919
live a certain way for five years and

136
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
then suddenly become the social

137
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,220
butterfly and you're good with women you

138
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,900
have friends and you have good fashion

139
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,000
that's not how life works you cannot

140
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,460
just segment parts of your life and say

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
you'll just work for five years and then

142
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,120
you play for five years that's not how

143
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,500
it is you have to find a blend of what

144
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,300
you love and what you can do what you're

145
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,800
passionate about and also gives you a

146
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,360
financial reward while you're still

147
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
maintaining a social life and then

148
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,780
that's how you live a blended happy life

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
and when you look back when you're 50

150
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,320
you actually did something fun you did

151
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,759
eventful things you have stories to tell

152
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
to your grandchildren the way he's

153
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,419
living or this way He suggests that you

154
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,060
live that's not how you make stories and

155
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,800
life is about making stories not about

156
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,720
perfect timing but that first five years

157
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,560
is military right you're doing five

158
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
hours of sleep but dedicate your

159
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,620
business and nothing but Fitness you

160
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,540
just that's a terrible idea so he's

161
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,340
literally suggesting I'm not making this

162
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,320
up he literally just said you should be

163
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,820
sleeping for about five hours per night

164
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
for those five years you know what's

165
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,940
that gonna do to your health if you

166
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
sleep for only five hours per night

167
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,180
that's not gonna be good for your

168
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,620
business and success your creativity is

169
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,419
going to come down your actual work

170
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,919
being done per day will come down the

171
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,120
way you interact with your team is not

172
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,800
going to be good and you know business

173
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,419
is not just about how much work and how

174
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,680
many hours you put in business is about

175
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,419
how much passion you have for the

176
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
product what the product brings to other

177
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,139
people's lives what meaning it creates

178
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
for them and you know you need your

179
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,560
sleep for first a healthy body and

180
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,180
healthy mind but also for the actual

181
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,740
monetary and financial rewards which

182
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
come with business you need your sleep

183
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,780
depending on these two things you might

184
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
sleep a little bit more for Fitness

185
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,600
purposes but you are dedicating every

186
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,860
minute hour second but then in the

187
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,259
second half of those five we introduce

188
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,520
stuff like better skin okay start taking

189
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,199
care of your skin your hair if you've

190
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,820
got it your beard hair Etc no you won't

191
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,680
you won't have your hair look at your

192
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,300
you look at you look at your head that's

193
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,220
what he has done to himself he did his

194
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,720
dedication for five years straight

195
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,039
sleeping for five hours and that's why

196
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,419
he probably lost his hair you know the

197
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,500
amount of stress that your body goes

198
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,880
through when it doesn't get enough sleep

199
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,800
that's probably what did it to you man

200
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,419
military lifestyle like I'm in the

201
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,100
military we don't sleep for just five

202
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,199
hours that happens if you're in the

203
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,639
field yes but usually you'll try to get

204
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,139
as much sleep as possible so that you're

205
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,000
having the performance level you need

206
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,139
for the next day the health is so

207
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,100
important once you get past 30 and

208
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,960
that's why I think because in your 20s

209
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,520
you can get away with me health is

210
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,919
important throughout your life not just

211
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
after you turn 35 just wanted to put it

212
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
out there maybe I wouldn't recommend

213
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,660
this but worst case scenario you could

214
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,979
have a [ __ ] diet get to 30 and you know

215
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,240
your box you'll just you've been hitting

216
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,979
the gym but you've had a [ __ ] diet [ __ ]

217
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,180
lifestyle you're not sleeping well at 30

218
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,380
you've got change Jack I know you said

219
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,580
you don't recommend this but you kind of

220
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,560
did recommend this you're basically

221
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,800
saying you sacrifice everything you're a

222
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,660
bulk person with bad diet bad Health bad

223
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
sleep and then you turn 35 and then

224
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,780
you're trying to turn all this around

225
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,280
that's terrible advice because you are

226
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,840
the habits that you build and you can

227
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,580
just suddenly change all your habits

228
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,620
when you turn 35 like if you have a lot

229
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,060
of healthy habits bad sleep and bad diet

230
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,560
that's going to continue it's going to

231
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,120
have its own momentum and you can just

232
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,319
turn it around when you're 35. now the

233
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,819
next one is to become more well-rounded

234
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,720
once you get to 30 I think it's

235
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,039
important to start learning languages

236
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,419
start working on yourself to start

237
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,419
incorporating fashion let's say into

238
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,340
your okay so you want to become a

239
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,960
well-rounded person after you turn 35

240
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,580
and then you start learning languages

241
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,139
and traveling you don't just get to

242
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,699
become a well-rounded person a

243
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,500
well-rounded person is not somebody who

244
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,660
has a lot of skills and experiences a

245
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,819
well-rounded person has a character of

246
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,380
his own he is organically just gone and

247
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,880
had a lot of experiences and learned a

248
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,500
lot of skills throughout his life it's

249
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,780
not something you can just log in when

250
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,860
you're 35 that's not how it works it can

251
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
be like you can start dressing better

252
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm going to start like I said skin and

253
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,880
stuff like that you just become a better

254
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,139
individual you go and learn different

255
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,400
things outside of just successfulness

256
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,740
whatever you become a better person okay

257
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,900
yeah yeah you wait till you're 35 to

258
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,360
become a better person great idea Chris

259
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,039
guys adrenal fatigue chronic fatigue

260
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
whatever you want to call it

261
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,220
hypothyroidism I've suffered from all of

262
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,960
them and it came I'm not surprised I'm

263
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,460
not surprised I'm from just working too

264
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,039
hard I've done it guys I've done it I've

265
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,259
done is I did it from like probably 21

266
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,060
to like 25 I burnt out two three times I

267
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,020
don't have any energy I got depressed to

268
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,940
the point I stood on the top of five

269
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,560
buildings like so so why haven't you

270
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,300
learned anything from this Chris you're

271
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
talking about chronic fatigue and how

272
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,360
you've been through this grind and you

273
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,639
were stood at the top of buildings he

274
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,139
was literally considering ending it all

275
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,300
because of the workload that he put on

276
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,560
himself this is not a sustainable way to

277
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,120
live and he should know this because

278
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,560
he's been through this and he saw the

279
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,560
results of this he's been suffering

280
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,860
so when is it right to invest your money

281
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
in crypto rather than your own health

282
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,880
crypto may or may not give you a return

283
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,680
I don't know but you should always be

284
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,300
okay with investing in your health you

285
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,339
know your health is always going to pay

286
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,200
dividends your health is always going to

287
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,180
pay you a reward there's no reason to

288
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,320
sacrifice your health for the pursuit of

289
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,180
money because then you have to spend

290
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,040
your money to get your health back it's

291
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,600
stupid you have to find a balance that

292
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
works for you because those days when a

293
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,779
man's life starts and it begins so I

294
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,600
think the idea that a man's life starts

295
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,459
when he's 30 is simply wrong man's life

296
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,380
starts when he's born he tries to make

297
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,300
the distinction between a woman's life

298
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,399
and a man's life and how a man gets its

299
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,320
Advantage when he's 30. there might be

300
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,839
truth to the idea that man gets an

301
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,300
advantage when he's 30. however his life

302
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,920
starts long before this the stories the

303
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,360
experiences the people who he meets the

304
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,000
skills that he learns the stories that

305
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,620
he reads places that he's been the foods

306
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,260
that he's eaten these are the things

307
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,200
which make him who he is when he turns

308
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,480
30 he's already a man he's already

309
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,519
accrued all these experiences and by

310
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,680
sacrificing these experiences you're

311
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,360
still a boy you're still not grown you

312
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,160
know you're still a teenager because you

313
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,940
fail to have the experiences now you're

314
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,940
just a kid with money

315
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
decisions let your employees work for

316
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,480
you let your money work for you and just

317
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,399
cement that well so Chris's ideology in

318
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,860
a nutshell is to sacrifice everything

319
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,740
you sacrifice sleep your diet your

320
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,420
health social life women everything for

321
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,640
five years so that you can make money

322
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,500
and then you use the money to get back

323
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,839
the things that you sacrificed this is

324
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,720
ass backwards thinking I think the

325
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
better idea is to incorporate pieces of

326
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,980
all these things in your life as you're

327
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,060
making money and the reason is simple I

328
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,740
don't think what Chris is saying

329
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,720
actually works like if you try to

330
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,700
sacrifice everything to make money I

331
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,680
think you'll be less successful at

332
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,480
making money than the guy who's found a

333
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
way to synergize all these activities

334
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,959
that he genuinely enjoys with his

335
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,860
business life I just think it's

336
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,820
important to get to the end of your life

337
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,980
look back and be like I did everything

338
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,540
with perfect timing who wants to get on

339
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,800
their deathbed and then look back and

340
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,200
see that he has done everything in the

341
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,959
perfect timing rather you want to look

342
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,300
back and say I did this this and this

343
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,459
this was amazing you know I helped so

344
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,800
many people with their lives I had this

345
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,899
adventure I met this woman I've tried

346
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,180
this this and this I've been to 20

347
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,920
countries and and of course family you

348
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,600
want to spend time with your family I'm

349
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,519
sad here editing my video and I realized

350
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,019
how negative it sounds it sounds as

351
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,060
though I'm doing a 10 minute character

352
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,279
assassination of Chris that's not my

353
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,320
intention I disagree with Chris on all

354
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:13,090
these points but I still respect the guy

355
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,090
