1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,319
I wasted the last four years of my life

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,320
I became an academic machine I could

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,960
have improved my behavior my body and

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,559
relationships I could have tried to

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,320
build a business or start a YouTube

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,320
channel instead I based my self-worth on

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,920
my grades and this drew me nearly

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,760
suicidal as I found myself worthless

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,320
compared to better students these words

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,560
aren't mine but they might as well have

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,720
been Andreas a channel subscriber sent

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,880
me this message on Instagram when I

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,039
asked you what is causing you the most

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,120
pain right now you told me that it was a

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,640
lack of Direction and andreas' message

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,280
it just puts a face on the pain of

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,840
millions of young folk when I ask you if

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,520
you're feeling like you're waiting for

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,079
life to start 70% said yes I felt that

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,840
same pain and regret in my 20s after I

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,680
burned out getting through

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,600
bioengineering in college but get this

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,239
Andreas is not in college he's still in

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,519
high school he's a teenager now I'm not

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,039
about to trivialize his worries because

26
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,680
he's young in fact his assessment of the

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,000
situation is precocious and I'm proud to

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
have an audience that is composed of men

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,720
of his potential it is only man of

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,439
potential that can feel regret for

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,360
wasted time if Andreas had no potential

32
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,320
he wouldn't feel this pain of time

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,280
wasted so if you're confused and if

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
you're in pain cuz you feel your youth

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,720
slipping by then I tell you that this is

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,759
a good sign the more pain you feel the

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,880
more potential you have I'm going to

38
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,159
give you five steps that ensure that you

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,280
don't waste your youth like the average

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,759
person will there's a lot of conflicting

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,759
messages on what you should do when

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,479
you're in your teens or your 20s should

43
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,200
you focus on school should you start a

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
business should you maybe start a

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,720
YouTube channel should you maybe do

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
coaching calls should you travel should

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,119
you read books every single Choice has

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,880
drawbacks but here's the thing you might

49
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,320
as well get used to it because in real

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,439
life there are no Solutions there's only

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
tradeoffs I've been an engineering

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,680
student I've worked in food preservation

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
I've worked in solar energy I've been a

54
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,360
genetics PhD student working on parasite

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,799
biology and human genetics I've been in

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
the Army as a 50 cal machine gunner and

57
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,439
now I'm a businessman I'm proud of my

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
growth in some of these phases and in

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,160
some other phases I am regretful of my

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,280
stagnation I want to spare you the pain

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,080
of that regret your time and your youth

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,560
is precious I wish somebody told me the

63
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,440
things which I'm about to tell you the

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,480
easiest way to waste years of your life

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,519
is to live towards somebody else's

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,360
vision for you one of the worst days of

67
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,680
my life was when I completed and

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,280
graduated from my engineering program it

69
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,080
was one of the finest programs of its

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,400
kind on the planet I was guaranteed an

71
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,680
$80,000 starting salary that could very

72
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,760
easily go to 100,000 and Beyond in a few

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,879
years Mega corporations like Fredo Le

74
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Monsanto and PepsiCo had stalls eagerly

75
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,120
waiting to give me a secure high-paying

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,920
prestigious job I worked brutally hard

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,000
to get where I was I had pulled all

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,519
nighters and sacrificed my health in

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,720
order to do these engineering products

80
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,599
and study for exams I'd gotten through

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,519
fluid dynamics thermodynamics Calculus 1

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,760
2 and 3 linear algebra differential

83
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,519
equations and so much more to get where

84
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,879
I was and even before then I had

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,159
sacrificed so much as a high schooler to

86
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,760
get into this top university so waking

87
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,280
up at 6:00 a.m. and studying as a

88
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,159
full-time job going to extra classes

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,239
after the actual school hours to

90
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,640
hopefully gain an advantage like Andreas

91
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,360
said I was an academic machine but still

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
that's what it took I had the degree in

93
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,959
hand I was living the dream but it was

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,080
of course somebody else's dream I felt

95
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,200
alone in the crowd and all my classmates

96
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,680
who graduated with me they had a day of

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,080
Celebration but for me it was a day of

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,080
depression that day I hated my parents I

99
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,920
hated them for being proud of me because

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,000
deep down I knew that I was a fraud they

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
had invested years worths of savings to

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,720
get me through college I went along with

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,560
it on autopilot because I was so scoped

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,560
into thinking that everything I wanted

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,200
was on the other side of that degree it

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
would have been better for me to have

107
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,879
just failed out of the program to face

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,439
reality and have those tough

109
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,319
conversations with my parents that I

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,840
never did the reality was I didn't

111
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,640
really want to be an engineer I wanted

112
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,720
to be a writer though at that time I

113
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,920
didn't even know that and get this my

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,919
parents aren't irrational or dogmatic

115
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,280
people they would have supported me if I

116
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,880
just had the gut to say the truth I felt

117
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,520
guilty though because I didn't want to

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
lose out on the competition I didn't

119
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,000
want to be a failure I didn't want to be

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,600
the man Left Behind the day you finish

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,720
your degree is supposed to be a day of

122
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Triumph because you holding proof in

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,400
your hands that you're officially ahead

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,440
of everyone in the game of life but

125
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,360
whenever you spend time chasing a dream

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,880
that isn't yours you take a step

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,120
backwards not forwards I felt I had

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,120
wasted four years of my life just like

129
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,039
Andreas did the first rule I want to

130
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,840
teach you is reject your programming the

131
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,320
truth is nobody has it figured out least

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,800
of all your Boomer parents our parents

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,960
grew up in a different economy with

134
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,080
different job security different saving

135
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,240
rates and different home prices

136
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
different opportunities they mean well

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
but they aren't profits the best they

138
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,120
can do is provide a framework in the

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
past it was great because technology and

140
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,120
the economy were fairly the same

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,639
generation to generation but now

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
everything is changing if you're the

143
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,520
kind of person who watches my channel

144
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,199
you have an above average intelligence

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,680
and above average potential a new era of

146
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,479
opportunity is open to you the only way

147
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,759
you can fail is by playing somebody

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,800
else's game accept the fact that you

149
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,880
don't know much about life but neither

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,120
does anybody else else everybody is

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
playing this game for the first time you

152
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,800
must be willing to accept the Grand

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Adventure that life offers and be open

154
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
to your unique instincts and intuitions

155
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,520
this is the only way you can find your

156
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,120
own unique talents and Gifts our

157
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,319
programming are just limiting beliefs

158
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,240
the first step in destroying a limiting

159
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,520
belief is just identification this is an

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,520
action step identify one source of your

161
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,280
pain in life it could be loneliness it

162
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,360
could be hating your looks it could be

163
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
being broke whatever isolate one

164
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,080
limiting belief that's keeping you stuck

165
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,000
and comment it below and I'll see if I

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,759
can provide any advice this is the only

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,639
way you can have the experiences and

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,960
live the stories that make you a unique

169
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,560
player in the great game of life rather

170
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,520
than being an interchangeable Pawn the

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
education system is a fossil from a

172
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,520
bygone era it was invented with the

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,720
explicit goal of creating Factory

174
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,479
workers the ideal factory worker does

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,599
the same thing every day at the same

176
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,039
time he follows a schedule that is set

177
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,240
for him by somebody else he eats exactly

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,759
what they expect tell him to he always

179
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,360
asks for permission to do something I

180
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,840
had to learn the hard way that there's

181
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,800
only one Authority whose judgment truly

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
matters everything else is [ __ ] stop

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,720
asking for permission be decisive roll

184
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,639
the dice and see what happens this

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,800
brings us to rule two rule two is to

186
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,000
make memories if you feel that time is

187
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,599
slipping by or that life is slipping by

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,080
then I want you to pay attention you

189
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,199
might have had this feeling that time is

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
speeding up that the days and weeks are

191
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,479
flying by faster than can even keep up

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,599
some people say that this is an illusion

193
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,879
because as you grow older each year is a

194
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,479
smaller proportion of your total life

195
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,120
this is not the reason our time

196
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,039
perception comes from how many memories

197
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,879
we're creating per day you can test this

198
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,960
out for yourself if you go for even a

199
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,440
short trip to a new city even years

200
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,319
later you can recollect the memories of

201
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,800
the new places you saw the things you

202
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,039
did the foods you ate a week of travel

203
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,039
actually feels like seven separate days

204
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,560
rather than merging into one long day so

205
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,879
it's clear that time perception is

206
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,800
uneven some special weeks feel full of

207
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,680
memories but some months get completely

208
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,960
forgotten two years ago I went to New

209
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,960
Orleans for 7 days and I still roughly

210
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,960
remember what I did on those days I

211
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,520
remember the hostel that I stayed in I

212
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,599
made friends with this cool Australian

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,280
dude and we went and tried the legendary

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,759
beignet at Cafe Dumont I went to the

215
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,800
World War II museum the next day I even

216
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,280
remember some of the cool art on display

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
the music scene the architecture I also

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,520
remember on the last day I met this

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
chick from Portland who showed me a good

220
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,280
time anyway in comparison a week of the

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,080
school or college routine feels like one

222
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,080
terribly long day even working on your

223
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,319
own business day after day can feel

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
drawn out no details stick out and it

225
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
all feels gray this is because if you do

226
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,440
the same thing day after day your brain

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
has no reason to record it this becomes

228
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,560
a mindset of you know different day

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
different [ __ ] and it's not just travel

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,759
that I'm speaking of I just use it as an

231
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,919
example that everybody can kind of

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,039
relate to and it's easy to understand

233
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,840
here's my observation every successful

234
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,039
man I know in real life got got there

235
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,680
from very different places many of them

236
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,519
though has had a unique formative

237
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,399
experience in their youth I know a

238
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,839
geneticist who traveled to India during

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,200
his college Years to study plant

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,519
genetics to you and me it may not sound

241
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,399
like an adventure but for him it was a

242
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,519
foundational experience that opens up

243
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,680
doors for him to this day and more

244
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,640
importantly it gave him context for why

245
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,120
his research mattered and this more than

246
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,279
his intelligence or schooling made him a

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,160
great scientist it is not about

248
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,519
traveling to meet women or anything like

249
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,680
that though I'm certainly not against

250
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,000
that it's the expansion of one's

251
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,560
Horizons to understand what is possible

252
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,880
if you allow yourself to be exposed to

253
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,800
the strange and dangerous situations

254
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
that's how you can test yourself you

255
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,279
don't have to go alone of course and go

256
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,440
with friends if you have the money go

257
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,440
explore the bazaars of turkey go to the

258
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,240
fortifications of Europe the temples of

259
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,320
the Far East or if you don't have money

260
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,279
just explore your own country go to the

261
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
Rocky Mountains Yellowstone National

262
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,040
Park the Grand Canyon expose yourself to

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,519
the great art great architecture and the

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,680
great achievements of mankind go to the

265
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
museums this is how you rise about the

266
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,079
swamp of mediocre Minds in fact there

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
are other options I was talking to

268
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,880
Pierre Durano an expert in regenerative

269
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,519
farming and permaculture he was actually

270
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,680
a guest in my private Community the

271
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,560
country club he talked about how there's

272
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,320
this organization called woof that

273
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,480
connects young guys and girls to

274
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,480
regenerative Farms that they can go for

275
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,160
a month or so and learn about organic

276
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,079
farming literally hands-on experience

277
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
you'd be provided with room board you'll

278
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,440
be provided with food you'll meet guys

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,440
and girls just like yourself who are

280
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,399
interested in being healthy and avoiding

281
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
toxins a month of that kind of

282
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,720
experience will set you apart from the

283
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
Rats of the Rat Race if you think about

284
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,200
it the girls you meet in such a

285
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,440
situation might be the kind that you

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,320
want to pursue here's another example

287
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,640
you could just choose to hike the

288
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,560
Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest

289
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Trail the at and the PCT it takes 5

290
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,560
months to complete these trills you'll

291
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,720
have to plan Food Water Shelter medic

292
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,560
supplies everything you can go with

293
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,839
friends you can go alone if you go with

294
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,680
friends it'll be more of a social

295
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,600
challenge if you go alone it'll be a

296
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,920
challenge against your own mind it's

297
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,160
things like this that instantly Elevate

298
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,920
you to a one in a million status without

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,360
much money you can Elevate yourself to

300
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,279
the status I'd wager that stuff like

301
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,079
this is more valuable than years of

302
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,639
college college is a tool only after you

303
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,760
know what you want to do in life should

304
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,240
you commit to college in his message

305
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,240
Andrea said he's afraid to be a

306
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,959
one-dimensional man and he should be

307
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,880
afraid a man should be capable of

308
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,519
creation and destruction he should be

309
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,760
able to wield a weapon and create art

310
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,160
make a fire or bake a cake he should be

311
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,279
able to perform first aid able to hunt

312
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,920
to survive he should be able to write an

313
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,440
essay or plant cabbages life for a man

314
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,240
should be anything but one-dimensional

315
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,240
however a man should have a sense of

316
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,120
purpose and an eye towards that one

317
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
thing that he will be remembered for

318
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,519
even men of singular Focus like Caesar

319
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
or Napoleon were nevertheless competent

320
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,200
at many things

321
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
but now let's bring it back to the

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,920
present I've never met a single person

323
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,040
who said man I wish I spent more time

324
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,040
studying if you're in the ages of 15 to

325
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,920
25 and you haven't had any Adventure

326
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,160
worth speaking of you need to fix that

327
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,600
right now if you're older than 25 and

328
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,560
you don't have any interesting stories

329
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,120
you really need to fix that right now

330
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,040
I've been thinking about this a lot over

331
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,959
the past year the heavens have given me

332
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,760
this beautiful gift in the form of this

333
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,760
YouTube channel it allows me to connect

334
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,519
with hundreds if not thousands of men

335
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,240
who would only be watching if they like

336
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
the overall Vibe of the entire Channel

337
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,560
Channel why not use this power what's

338
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
stopping me from organizing in-person

339
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,720
events that could result in formative

340
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,320
experiences and memories it wouldn't be

341
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,160
easy but I could organize a 3-day hike

342
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,040
across the Alps of Europe or we could

343
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,279
explore the ruins of Greece we could go

344
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,600
to the Rocky Mountains the world is our

345
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,279
playground and we should use it as such

346
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,360
certainly you could go solo but it's

347
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,800
just more fun with friends speaking of

348
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,720
rule number three is to build bonds

349
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
nothing of note was built by single man

350
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,279
in isolation the greatest projects are

351
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,839
only possible through collaboration what

352
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,800
was Caesar without lavenus but here's

353
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,760
the thing it's not about the expected

354
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,199
benefits you want bonds with others

355
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,720
because it is critical for your own

356
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,800
mental health even the most robust Minds

357
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,880
decay in isolation but how do you find

358
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,160
men like yourself the isolation of our

359
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,800
generation is structural it's not just

360
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,399
psychological have you ever heard of

361
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,160
this concept of growth houses the idea

362
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
is simple the idea is a group of

363
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,199
like-minded guys team up to supercharge

364
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,440
their growth I know some entrepreneur

365
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,360
friends right now who have booked this

366
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,360

women isn't this the ideal life for a

man before marriage and kids I would

377
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,040
have joined them but I couldn't because

378
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:29,720
I have this long stint of military

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,320
training coming up which mil training is

380
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,920
similar in a kind of way an entire

platoon focused on one Mission the idea

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,279
of growth houses is so appealing to me

383
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,320
that I want to organize these some in

384
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,199

392
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,800
fleshed out the growth house which I'm

393
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
imagining is a physical embodiment of

394
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,880
the country club imagine spending a

403
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,240
combination of mental Clarity community

404

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,639
competition for you anymore you're

us to rule four focus on health nobody

408
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,839
in the history of mankind would have

409
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,480
regretted investing in Health the worst

410
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,000
thing about the youth of today is just

411
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,279
how anxious everybody is everybody's

412
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
cortisol is through the roof it is is

413
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,800
normal we have the hormonal profile of a

414
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
prey animal investing in health is the

415
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,839
one investment that makes sense at any

416
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
point in life and always pays dividends

417
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,199
if you're young you want to put

418
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
resources into hormonal Health when I

419
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,839
was in my teens and early 20s I really

420
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
didn't know anything about these topics

421
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,040
and even today most people haven't a

422
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
clue of what a good nutritional plan

423
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,079
looks like or what the benefits of a

424
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,759
detox protocol can have most people

425
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,360
still think that butter is going to give

426
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,240
them a heart attack or that sugar is

427
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,639
going to give them diabetes we know

428
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,040
better here are some non-negotiables get

429
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,720
Sunshine get good sleep eat real foods

430
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
get some exercise if you can do these

431
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
four you're already winning and I'm

432
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,759
going to be releasing updated esoteric

433
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,000
Health guides that focus on the 20% most

434
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,279
effective steps so watch out for those

435
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,560
and finally we get to the last and most

436
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,360
important rule rule number five is to

437
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,680
have faith faith is the illogical and

438
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,720
unfounded belief in something faith is

439
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,399
an asymmetric Advantage Embrace Divine

440
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,920
carelessness stop being a neurotic mess

441
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,240
have faith in your own destiny there's a

442
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,759
reason the Ancients praised youthfulness

443
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,680
recklessness and carefree abundance if

444
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,319
you have faith in your eventual Victory

445
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,800
you can actually live in the present

446
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,199
instead of being an anxious rat in a lab

447
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,079
experiment competition and constant

448
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,880
comparison to others is peasant

449
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,880
mentality it comes with constant

450
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,240
self-doubt and comes with not having

451
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,720
faith in one's own Destiny it leads to

452
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,600
short-term thinking it leads to

453
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,000
dishonesty and even physical ugliness in

454
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,199
the '90s and the early 2000s we spoke of

455
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,920
the midlife crisis but over the past

456
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,319
decade this midlife crisis has been

457
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,959
moving younger and younger the reason is

458
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,279
because young men are absorbing the

459
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,600
anxieties and mindsets of old men now

460
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,519
you think I'm going to blame social

461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
media for yet again brainwashing the

462
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
youth the problem actually started much

463
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,639
earlier and it's actually a deeper

464
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,480
problem even before social media there

465
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,839
was a blurring of the lines between

466
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,600
Youth and and full adulthood that's why

467
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,959
today we have youth that are filled with

468
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,639
the anxieties of adults and at the same

469
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,560
time we have adults stuck in a pseudo
