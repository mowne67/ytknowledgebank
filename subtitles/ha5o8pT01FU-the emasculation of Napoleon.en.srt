1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,759
wiim Phoenix is too old and is also kind

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,240
of ugly to play Napoleon Napoleon was

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,559
known for his Aura of command the fact

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
that he could inspire people to line up

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,280
to die for him and most importantly

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,559
Napoleon was young that's what has set

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,199
him apart so much from his

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,920
contemporaries his story and his Legend

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,800
are so alien to the modern bugman that

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,320
he tries to humanize Napoleon but can

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,039
you humanize a force of nature the

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
entire aim of this movie was to say that

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
Napoleon was nothing more than a loser

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,000
sing for a mid who just happened to be

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,960
at the right place at the right time

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,760
they want to say look here man your

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,320
great general of History was nothing

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,079
more than a [ __ ] and a sexual deviant

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,920
the only reason he had any ambition was

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,399
because of sexual frustration they want

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,280
to say that if he attained Glory it's

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,280
only because of his entrapment with

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,760
women either his wife Josephine or his

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
mother how the Barbie movie had more

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,039
masculine energy than Napoleon but fear

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,320
not this video EX exist to correct the

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,560
flaws of this Dreadful movie most people

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,799
don't know this but Napoleon was a man

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,759
out of his time and I mean that even in

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,080
the context of his own life Napoleon was

31
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,640
a great man in modern times people of

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,119
his own time were shocked into

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
submission by seeing a meteor in human

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,840
form or they were seduced into following

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
him as he had the aura of Destiny about

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,240
him but instead of focusing on such

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,680
higher Concepts as Destiny they could

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,439
have instead just focused on his

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,240
military achievements they could have

40
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,680
focused on his ability to inspire Fire

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,360
Devotion and maddening loyalty they

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,880
could have focused on his military and

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,600
economics reforms they could have

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,520
focused on his ability to bend entire

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,479
armies to his will whether his own or

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
his enemies they're going to focus on

47
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,280
his victory at yena or his maneuvering

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
at borodino but no instead they just

49
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,040
focus on Josephine 60% of the movie is

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,119
freaking Josephine and this is the most

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,000
boring and uninteresting part of his

52
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,719
life Napoleon could have been such a

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,520
phenomenal movie this could be the movie

54
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,240
that defined the genre of historical

55
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,240
films going forward but instead they

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
chose to make it a shitty be drama they

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,119
could have at the very least shown off

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,119
the opulence of the French Court they

59
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,599
could have shown off the architecture of

60
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,440
that time but no they chose to put this

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,040
gray blue filter on the entire movie

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
makes think the entire movie looks kind

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,000
of cold and dreary it's almost like they

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,239
want us to believe that the past was as

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,480
dark and dismal place this is not true

66
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,440
there was far more Beauty in the past

67
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,280
it's only now that our art is polluted

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
and our architecture fails to create any

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,599
kind of inspir ation in us so let us

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,480
look at Napoleon more closely and let us

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,519
use history and philosophy to guide us

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,280
into understanding the story Napoleon is

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
an example of a real life superhero he

74
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,239
was the manifestation of the spirit of

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,360
the French people I have a belief that

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,400
Napoleon was the Avatar of the French

77
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,159
people at that time he embodied their

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,040
pride and tactical Brilliance and

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,040
Amplified it to the maximum but he also

80
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,760
Amplified the sexual freedoms let's say

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
of the French people so when I say

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,599
Napoleon was a man of the people I mean

83
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,720
this very literally he was the

84
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,799
personification of the French population

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
at that time their entire hopes dreams

86
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,640
and frustrations came to be in the

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,120
embodiment of this one man and this

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,560
happens quite a few times in history

89
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,720
Caesar was the embodiment of the

90
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,480
tyrannical and hero worshipping aspect

91
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,280
of the Roman people and Ashoka was the

92
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,440
embodiment of the Hindu and Buddhist

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,680
philosophies brought to rule of course I

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,920
do not expect a modern Hollywood movie

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,599
to ponder on these deep topics I do not

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,159
expect them to be able to place so much

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,280
agency in their own characters all

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,040
protagonists especially if they are male

99
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,920
are made to be almost mentally

100
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,720
handicapped in order to make them more

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,319
humanized and more believable for

102
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,439
example the latest James Bond they

103
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,959
literally gave him PTSD for no reason we

104
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,640
watch Bond as an archetype and that's

105
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,799
exactly the case with Napoleon Napoleon

106
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,720
is to be seen as an archetype he's to be

107
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,799
seen as a force of nature not a man we

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,720
want to draw inspiration and draw power

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,200
from him but instead we have this of

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,760
course this goes against the Hollywood

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,319
narrative this is why Napoleon fails

112
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,079
while a movie like 300 shines of course

113
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,079
a movie like 300 will never be made

114
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,319
again because it shows the ravening

115
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,480
appetites of well-trained men and thei

116
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,720
doesn't even mention Napoleon's Marshals

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,879
how dare they make a movie about

118
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,439
Napoleon without talking about his

119
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,519
General his Marshals Marshall nay Murad

120
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,160
berad do aino and davu these were

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,440
celebrities in their own right these

122
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,440
were men who were praised across France

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
as much as Napoleon was and we don't

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,919
even get a mention of their names

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,720
instead we get a 60% of the movie

126
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,240
dedicated to Josephine the does

127
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Napoleon's success come from his highly

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
talented generals and Marshals or does

129
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,039
it come from the source between

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
Josephine's legs the movie doesn't talk

131
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,240
about how Napoleon knew his soldiers by

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,360
name he would go among the ranks among

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,960
the lowest ranked soldiers know them by

134
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,479
name know their family history asked

135
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,280
them about their daughters asked them

136
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,199
about their hopes and aspirations and it

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,639
wasn't just simple Soldiers the greatest

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
artists of his time writers poets would

139
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,520
orbit around Napoleon like planets

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,160
around a star but the movie doesn't even

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,960
attempt to explain this magnitude and of

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,800
course Wen Phoenix is the complete wrong

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,320
choice for the lead role for this movie

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Napoleon was not a crusty old looking

145
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,080
dude who looks like he needs a shower we

146
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,039
need a handsome young youth a man of

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
power and Charisma who looks as though

148
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,800
he could inspire people to follow him

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,000
onto death I nothing against JP as an

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,560
actor is just that he looks broken and

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,639
worn down which makes sense for movies

152
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,759
like Joker where he was phenomenal does

153
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,560
that make sense for Napoleon because

154
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,520
Napoleon was not broken he was a man

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
above his peers I could imagine a

156
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,639
situation where men are following Wen

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,919
Phoenix's character into battle is so D

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
and uncharismatic but speaking of which

159
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,880
the battle scenes were pretty cool they

160
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
showed only two battles they only showed

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,039
aitz and waterloop and both the battles

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,800
felt really short almost like the

163
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,800
battles were the interruption from the

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
main story line which is Napoleon and

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,319
Josephine still the battles were good

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm going to give credit where it's due

167
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,600
the Battle of ostritz was really cool

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,720
it's cool to see how Napoleon sunk his

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,560
enemies by opening up the Frozen lake

170
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,039
under their feet using cannon fire

171
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,680
there's also a scene near the start of

172
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,199
the movie where Napoleon uses grape shot

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,479
against his own French citizens and this

174
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,759
is how the director should have undercut

175
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
the hero Narrative of Napoleon see I

176
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,720
don't think Napoleon was a good guy

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,360
Napoleon was not the good guy if you in

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
fact if you wanted to show Napoleon as

179
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,800
the villain of the story you could

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
absolutely do that you are more than

181
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,720
free to show Napoleon as capricious

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,520
tyrannical over ambitious evil even you

183
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,199
can absolutely make Napo to be seen as a

184
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,360
nemesis of mankind this is all a

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,160
reasonable approach what is not a

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
reasonable approach is to make him seem

187
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,880
like a bumbling idiot who only cares

188
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
about and he only has success because he

189
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,520
was at the right time and right place

190
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
this is not reasonable so that scene

191
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,400
when Napoleon opens fire on his own

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,560
friends people this is historically

193
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,039
accurate and this does show what length

194
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,639
Napoleon would go to achieve success but

195
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,599
the scene was cut short and doesn't have

196
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,360
the impact it should have had see if you

197
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,120
wanted to show Napoleon as a conflict

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,960
icted figure an egomaniac and as a power

199
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,800
hungry Tyrant you absolutely could do

200
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,560
that and that would be a legitimate way

201
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,759
to show Napoleon was not somebody to

202
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,319
emulate that's fine but instead they

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
show him as a puppet [ __ ] to his wife

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,319
Josephine and the movie also did one

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,960
more good thing it showed the irony of

206
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,960
the French Revolution so the French

207
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,919
Revolution for those who do not know was

208
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,280
a revolution in which the monarchy of

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,639
France was deposed and replaced by a

210
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,440
people's Rule and this went just about

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
as well as you'd expect the people's

212
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,199
rule was even more more brutal and

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
bloody than the monarchy ever was so the

214
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,319
monarchy was a strict hierarchy and when

215
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,039
the people's rule came to be they tried

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
to make it as though everybody was equal

217
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,479
and there was perfect egalitarian

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
society didn't quite happen like that

219
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,240
and this led to many ironic moments for

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
example when Josephine's son not

221
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,720
Napoleon son Josephine had a son before

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,720
Napoleon he asks Napoleon for his

223
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,080
father's sword as a memorabilia and

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
Napoleon explains that citizens aren't

225
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,479
allowed to hold weapons in this New

226
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,840
France and this reminded me of the soku

227
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,159
i period in Japan as soon as power was

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,199
Consolidated in the hands of a few the

229
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,400
first thing which they always do is to

230
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,879
confiscate the Weaponry of the citizens

231
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,720
this is a very common tactic which all

232
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,039
tyrants use so understand this the

233
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,479
freedom of the American people is not in

234
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,840
the First Amendment but rather in the

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,400
second but speaking of the French

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Revolution the American Revolution was

237
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,240
actually happening at a similar time so

238
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
why did the French Revolution fail so

239
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,599
abysmally while the American Revolution

240
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,159
succeeded is because of one man and this

241
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,200
brings us to the theories of history and

242
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,919
that one single man that One Singular

243
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,320
man was George Washington there are two

244
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,880
views of looking at history one is the

245
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,039
great man view of History this says that

246
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,240
great men singular men at the

247
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,920
appropriate times basically dictated the

248
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
course of history the opposite view the

249
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Marxist view is that grand socioeconomic

250
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,440
changes is what drives history and any

251
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,080
of these names from history you know

252
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,360
Napoleon Caesar Alexander Etc these are

253
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,120
just leaves upon the stream of History

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,120
this notion I reject history is made by

255
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,519
individuals the fact that the American

256
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Revolution did not follow the same

257
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
trajectory as the French Revolution

258
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,440
comes down to the actions and ethics of

259
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,920
that one man General George Washington

260
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
he was a man who was entirely

261
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,519
uncorruptible and he chose by himself to

262
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,000
abdicate power rather than hold it for

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,560
himself on the other hand the movie

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,079
shows Napoleon to be a bumbling idiot

265
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,360
who just happens to luck out every now

266
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,560
and then but this is completely

267
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,519
inaccurate Napoleon was not at the right

268
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,200
place at the right time he made the

269
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,160
right place and the right time so

270
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Napoleon failed you say Napoleon didn't

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,120
achieve what he set out to and he got

272
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,720
exiled yeah in fact he got exiled twice

273
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,959
and even in here there is a Learning

274
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,240
lesson after his disastrous campaign in

275
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,720
Russia speaking of disaster campaigns

276
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,800
the movie completely neglects to mention

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,360
his campaign in Spain they completely

278
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,120
don't even mention that Napoleon sent

279
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,040
his armies to Spain of course that's a

280
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,440
story onto itself so Napoleon met with

281
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,320
some serious opposition in the Iberian

282
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,320
Peninsula got to askap really but we

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,279
don't want to talk about that that we

284
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,880
just want to talk about Josephine

285
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,000
apparently in this movie and this is so

286
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,920
pathetic man Napoleon's generals were

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
such charismatic leaders on their own

288
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,040
right each of them was a crazy character

289
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,680
and each of them were so different from

290
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,000
each other you could create an entire

291
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,079
movie about each of Napoleon's Marshals

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,360
but no they weren't even mentioned by

293
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,720
name instead 60% of the damn runtime was

294
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,079
given over to Josephine Josephine's only

295
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,320
contribution to history was to be a [ __ ]

296
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,200
but even in defeat there are learning

297
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,040
lessons to be had Elba was a small

298
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,560
little fishing Village it was an island

299
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,360
and they exiled Napoleon to basically be

300
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,040
in confinement over there and you know

301
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,120
what they retired him when Napoleon met

302
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,000
with defeat in Russia and came back they

303
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,360
gave him 2 million Franks per year to

304
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,399
just go and retire in Elba he could have

305
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,880
literally just gone to Elba lived his

306
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,880
life out and relaxed but no he was a man

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,920
of Titanic energy there was no such

308
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,600
thing as Stillness for this man instead

309
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,399
he actually took control of the island

310
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,720
of Elba and developed it so El was just

311
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,079
a random sleepy little fishing town but

312
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,160
after Napoleon came he modernized that

313
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
little village the same little sleepy

314
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,959
town which was existing in that same

315
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,360
exact state of stasis for probably

316
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,279
hundreds of years now became a modern

317
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,880
Village because of Napoleon's presence

318
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,519
and his or of command his ability to

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,320
strategize his Ambitions for his people

320
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,560
around him that's what I mean when I say

321
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
a single man can make all the difference

322
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,240
this man literally couldn't stop himself

323
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,000
from developing and developing the

324
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,200
people around him and then he Escape I

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,320
say I am

326
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,079
Napoleon I am Emperor Napoleon escaped

327
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
from his Exile from the island of Elba

328
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,200
and came back to the French Mainland and

329
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,200
every single Monarch in Europe

330
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,639
collectively [ __ ] themselves at his

331
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,000
arrival the French monarchy so what

332
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,320
happened was when Napoleon was deposed

333
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,399
they reinstalled the French monarchy and

334
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,240
this French monarchy sent Army after

335
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,360
Army to destroy Napoleon before he can

336
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,880
come to Paris and they all failed

337
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,959
because as soon as they saw the man who

338
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,600
they fought for and who fought with them

339
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,360
they wouldn't be able to fire upon Him

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
rather they would actually change their

341
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
size they would defect and they would

342
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,399
join Napoleon and there is a scene about

343
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,199
this in the movie but it's so brief it's

344
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,279
almost forgettable this is the aura of

345
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,880
Napoleon man this is the thing which

346
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,839
neolin is known for his Aura of presence

347
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,800
and command the idea that he could go up

348
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,399
to an army and say hey boys I know you

349
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,480
know me I know you recognize me I fought

350
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
by you in every single battle that we

351
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,639
were in

352
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,360
why would you point your guns towards me

353
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,399
why not join me let's take France back

354
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,519
and make it great again that was what

355
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,519
Napoleon stood for and every Army did

356
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,720
defect they joined Napoleon instead of

357
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,399
the armies destroying him each Army made

358
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,920
Napoleon stronger and stronger until he

359
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,920
had built up well he didn't rebuild his

360
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,360
entire Army right but he built up a

361
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,079
decent enough force and every other

362
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,320
Monarch in Europe had to combine forces

363
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,760
to deal with Napoleon he was outnumbered

364
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,120
something like 3 to1 or something like

365
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,399
that something terrible this this movie

366
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,040
does a terrible job of showing why

367
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,199
Napoleon inspired such levels of

368
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,320
devotion it doesn't even try to explain

369
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,360
it and this is the Mystique this is the

370
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,720
challenge the director has completely

371
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,120
missed out on the challenge of Napoleon

372
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,360
the idea of Napoleon and Josephine and

373
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
him being a cockold and other that's the

374
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,320
easy way out that's the easy and boring

375
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,760
and lame part of Napoleon's life which

376
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,880
is very easy to portray in a movie The

377
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Challenge is to portray Napoleon's

378
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,360
Charisma the challenge is to portray

379
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,120
Napoleon's power of inspiration how do

380
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,160
you do that on the screen that's a real

381
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,519
challenge the movie completely fails to

382
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,279
deliver upon the vision of the loyalty

383
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,079
and Brotherhood within the French army

384
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,160
and of course their allegiance to the

385
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
emperor of France Napoleon and so for

386
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,720
all these reasons I give this movie a

387
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
one French bare skin hat out of five if

388
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,680
you enjoyed this it's more than likely

389
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,360
that you'll enjoy my review on movie 300

390
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
a movie that some people think is

391
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,399
historically inaccurate but is actually

392
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,360
completely authentic to the mindset of

393
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,079
the Greeks at that time or perhaps you

394
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,639
would want to watch my review on the

395
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,320
Barbie movie which ironically is more

396
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,440
masculine than the Napoleon Movie I'll

397
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,880
have these tiles pop up shortly go ahead

398
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,880
and watch if you so please
