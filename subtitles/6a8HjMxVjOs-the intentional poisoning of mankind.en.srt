1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,980
the scientific Community is comprised of

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,460
human beings and human beings are

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,679
subject to the same pressures money

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,139
Prestige promotions all that kind of

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,059
stuff so it is not impossible to

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,460
influence or bribe scientists the food

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,580
pyramid was a psychological operation

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,619
the food pyramid was known to be BS from

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,539
the very start and there were some Brave

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,060
scientists who stood up against it even

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,039
in the start but they were silenced and

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,380
of course the media government and the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,739
companies promoted the food pyramid

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,600
knowing full well that it was BS so I

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,820
don't believe that you should be

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,040
somebody who blindly trusts science

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
science has been co-opted before and

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,760
will continue to be co-opted by big

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,980
business interests another example is

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,960
the sugar industry the sugar industry

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,780
literally in the 1960s I believe paid

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,579
off Harvard scientists to say that carbs

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,739
good fats bad and that's where the whole

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,899
you know fats are bad ideology comes

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,760
from companies have succeeded in paying

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,980
off scientists before which is why I

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,660
believe in to look more broadly not just

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,339
at the science to understand what is

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,439
good for us because understand this I

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,680
have this system I call it the psyop

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,439
system science s i intuition oh

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,479
observation and P philosophy and I use

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,100
this system to evaluate what is true and

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,600
false in my life and I can share that

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,799
with you so we talk about the science

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,840
now I'm going to hit you with some

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,000
philosophy science gives us facts and

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,220
observations it doesn't tell us what we

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,960
should actually do should belongs to the

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,119
realm of philosophy understand this we

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
use the system of innocent until proven

42
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,380
guilty in courts but when it comes to

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,220
our health and when it comes to adding

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,500
new alien substances to our diet which

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,479
could harm us and the health of our kids

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,119
and our families we should use the

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,820
principle of guilty until proven

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,320
innocent so understand this thousands

49
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,200
and millions of years humans have gone

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,540
without poorly unsaturated fatty acids

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,700
this is a new addition to our diet which

52
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,460
industry has created for us they might

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,259
be good but it's on them the burden is

54
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,720
on them to to prove that it's good the

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,820
burden is not on us to prove that it's

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,039
bad you understand the burden of proof

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,899
lies with the people who are creating

58
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,120
this stuff to show that it is harmless

59
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,840
and good for us which they have failed

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,599
in doing for me I'll happily say that

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
this is guilty until proven innocent so

62
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,599
when the science is a toss-up I will

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,060
avoid these newfangled inventions and

64
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,459
defer to tradition so that's your

65
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,440
philosophy observation now I'm going to

66
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,260
talk about observation what have I

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,879
experienced in my own personal life when

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,340
I switched over from seed oils to

69
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,080
saturated fats well one thing skin

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,519
quality so understand that the skin is

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,019
made of cells like your entire body is

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,300
made of cells right and cells have a

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,760
membrane around them and this membrane

74
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,800
is made of fat

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,080
literally the fast that you consume will

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,879
incorporate into those membranes so if

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
you use good fats that will incorporate

78
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,840
into the membranes if you use unstable

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,500
fats that'll incorporate into the

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,660
membranes I I saw my skin go from you

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,239
know I had pimples and I had acne I had

82
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,700
all the stuff become clear and healthy

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,620
and you know I have I have no complaints

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,440
at all about my skin nowadays that I

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,900
switched to seed oils I also have a very

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,640
powerful esoteric skin care routine so

87
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,080
if you want that video let me know in

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,000
the comments you know what a country

89
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,920
club is it's where it leads hangout and

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,319
you're not invited if you're subscribed

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,000
you're likely interested in the esoteric

92
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,280
Health movement and also the multiple

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,959
psiops inflicted upon us if you want to

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
learn directly from me it also meet

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
fellow people just like you who are

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,340
interested in esoteric knowledge then

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,920
you should consider joining the college

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,500
Country Club another observation energy

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,239
levels so like I said the skin cells

100
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,760
have membranes which these fats will

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,239
incorporate into every cell in your body

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,220
has mitochondria and mitochondria is the

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,159
PowerHouse of cell I know everybody

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,500
knows this so mitochondria also has a

105
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,360
membrane and if you have unstable fats

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,580
in it it messes up the energy system

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,299
which is why you feel slow and sluggish

108
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,659
if you had seed oils most people know it

109
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,420
as vegetable oil we in the know know it

110
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,140
as seed oil but the industry term for

111
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,859
this stuff is RBD oil that's refined

112
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,500
bleached and deodorized oil that's the

113
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,620
stuff which they have convinced you and

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,000
your family that is good for you you

115
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,280
know something's wrong with a product

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,100
when the company literally spends

117
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,380
Millions upon millions of dollars on

118
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,840
marketing to convince that that their

119
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,419
product is better than what we had

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
traditionally if the polyunsaturated

121
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,620
fatty acids were the miracle they

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,600
claimed it to be it was cheaper and

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,360
better for you then they wouldn't have

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,820
to spend so much on this fraudulent

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,340
marketing campaign the psychological

126
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,199
operation in order to make you buy it

127
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,960
the free market would have selected for

128
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,340
that product but no here's what they did

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,440
here's the psychological operation

130
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,600
you've heard of the American Heart

131
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,060
Association you probably recognize the

132
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,120
logo do you know that that organization

133
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,540
is completely completely bought and paid

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,580
for by the seed oil industrial complex

135
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,240
that's right so what they did in the

136
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,720
1960s I believe they literally had this

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,840
radio campaign and it was a lottery

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,120
system so a company wins a prize from

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
Procter and Gamble which at the time and

140
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,539
even today is probably the biggest

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,120
player in the seed oil industry

142
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,160
so they have this radio contest and the

143
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,039
American Heart Association just happened

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,940
to win it completely by coincidence I'm

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,900
sure and they were pumped with 19

146
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,840
million dollars

147
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,520
by PNG and do you think there was a

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,460
conflict of interest of course there was

149
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,080
so in a few years you know the American

150
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,660
Heart Association goes from being

151
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,520
underfunded to massively funded and

152
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,820
literally every single piece of

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,860
propaganda they put out is in favor of

154
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,620
the seed oil industry is that a

155
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,940
coincidence I think not the reason why a

156
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,280
lot of people believe that Paulie

157
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,539
unsaturated fatty acids are good for

158
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,259
their heart

159
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,360
literally the afha's logo has a hard

160
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,759
picture on it it's because they make the

161
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,860
claim polyunsaturated fatty acids are

162
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,840
good for the heart which is a claim that

163
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,680
is in my opinion

164
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,539
fraudulent at worst faulty at best today

165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,819
you're going to learn everything you

166
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,639
ever wanted to know about cooking oils

167
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,500
seed oils all that stuff what you should

168
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,979
be using how you should cook your food

169
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,780
for both Better Health better skin and

170
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,699
better testosterone levels and if you're

171
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,720
a woman watching this keep watching

172
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,360
because this is not just about

173
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,880
testosterone your hormonal levels are

174
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,740
equally important as men's and these

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,840
seed oils affect you just as much as

176
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,880
they affect us and along the way you

177
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,900
learn how to make amazing chicken

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,639
drumsticks sauteed in duck fat and it's

179
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,020
going to taste amazing right now I'm

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,940
going to lay some foundations I'm going

181
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,800
to teach you the terms I'm going to use

182
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,360
for the rest of this video so if you've

183
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,340
heard of polyunsaturated fatty acids

184
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,800
you've heard of saturated you've heard

185
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,020
of monounsaturated what are these and

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,360
what are some examples I got them all

187
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,880
right here so there's three types

188
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,860
there's the saturated monounsaturated

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
and polyunsaturated and I'll break it

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,080
down super easy for you so the solid

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,199
stuff solid think of it it starts with s

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,360
right solid is saturated it's stable

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,280
that's what you need to know so like

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
butter butter is literally solid right

195
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,060
you're not going to be able to run a

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,460
fork through butter it's a solid it's a

197
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,979
saturated fat and it is stable at all

198
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,919
temperatures that's butter highly

199
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,199
nutritious you should cook with this

200
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,000
here we have ghee ghee is also pretty

201
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,940
solid like you cannot you know just run

202
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,319
a fork through this this is a saturated

203
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:55,319
fat it is stable it's a solid SSS

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,060
then we have duck fat it looks like it's

205
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,500
more liquid but it's still like kind of

206
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,020
solid like you can see the bottom is

207
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,759
pretty solid it's a saturated fat very

208
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,560
good highly temperature resistant

209
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,319
doesn't oxidize in high temperatures you

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,099
should cook with this then we have olive

211
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,139
oil which is a monounsaturated fat so we

212
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,300
were talking about saturated fats SSS

213
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,220
stable stable stable and now we're

214
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
coming to a liquid so this is different

215
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,319
this is different now we have

216
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,300
monounsaturated fats this is a oil of

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,879
course olive oil so what do I mean by

218
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,539
monounsaturated it means it has one

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,700
unstable Bond one double bond which is

220
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,200
inherently unstable for organic

221
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,479
chemistry reasons which I'm not going to

222
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,520
go into in this video so should you cook

223
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,979
with this yeah you can because it has

224
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,140
only one unstable Bond it's still

225
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,580
resistant to oxidization and olive oil

226
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,620
naturally contains a whole bunch of

227
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,600
antioxidants which also help it resist

228
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,220
oxidation so it's pretty stable I don't

229
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,760
have any problem cooking with olive oil

230
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,399
I approve now we have the bad guys so we

231
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,500
have here is Sunflower Oil it's almost

232
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,500
like water it's not very thick at all

233
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,160
it's pretty light it's not viscous and

234
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,580
then we have also sesame oil so these

235
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,100
are your pufas pufas polyunsaturated

236
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,899
fatty acids so poly means many mono

237
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,480
means one which is very the olive oil

238
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,420
comes from so polyunsaturated fatty

239
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,839
acids it means it has many unstable

240
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,480
bonds many double Bonds in the carbon

241
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,760
carbon molecule structure so these ones

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,740
I don't recommend you cook with these

243
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,160
are unstable they're not resistant to

244
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,260
oxidization and I will not cook with

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,360
these I know a lot of people do I do not

246
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,360
recommend it I will go into more details

247
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,100
but that's the basics now before I take

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,100
too long with all the science stuff I

249
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,080
want to get my dinner cooking so here we

250
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,540
go this is how we prepare this okay I'm

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,700
just gonna dump these guys in here we

252
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,740
got some chicken now what you want to

253
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,779
look for with chicken ideally you want

254
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,120
pasture raised if you have cage free

255
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,300
that's fine too the reason why that's

256
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,279
true is you don't want grain fed quite

257
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,500
often the grain feed which they give to

258
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,380
these chickens is moldy and mold

259
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,540
releases something called Zea which is a

260
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,880
estrogenic substance so you don't want

261
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,860
your chickens to be eating moldy grains

262
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,660
so you should go for pasture raised and

263
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,820
also let me explain what I'm going to

264
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,860
put on these before I cook them so this

265
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,620
recipe which I'm doing is with duck fat

266
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,360
you can use ghee you can use butter you

267
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,459
can even use olive oil no problem but

268
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm going to use duck fat so we were

269
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,839
talking about unstability and why that's

270
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,519
important here's why so when those

271
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,120
double Bonds in the carbon structure

272
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,620
gets disrupted by oxidation processes it

273
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,779
can lead to the formation of something

274
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,700
called aldehydes which is a class of

275
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,700
organic compounds aldehydes one of them

276
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,860
for example is 4-H and E is literally a

277
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,339
known carcinogen so when you oxidize

278
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,079
some of these oils you literally create

279
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,120
cancer-causing substances to form in

280
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,420
those oils that's why I would never cook

281
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,519
with polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas

282
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,980
seed oils in other words so I'm just

283
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,779
adding my duck fat right onto the raw

284
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,600
chicken and

285
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,279
you can eat the stuff tastes good

286
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,120
so putting that away

287
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:14,100
and now I'm going to essentially add all

288
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,140
the spices I'll tell you which spices

289
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,060
you need which spices you don't really

290
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,300
need and what's the easiest way to make

291
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,000
this stuff so first I'm going to add

292
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,700
salt that's the main thing salt is

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,399
indispensable you need salt a lot of

294
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,860
these people like the mainstream Health

295
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,240
types they think salt is bad for you and

296
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,339
it's going to cause hypertension and

297
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,019
whatnot it doesn't it's actually pretty

298
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,959
good for you and if you're an athletic

299
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,579
person you absolutely need salt as a

300
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,440
part of your diet so how much salt am I

301
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,940
adding like I don't measure these things

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,399
you know how other cooking channels will

303
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,720
literally measure like at an at an

304
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,000
autistic level like how much salt

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,920
they're adding I don't this is how it's

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,980
salt I'm adding you have a camera like

307
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,079
just make your own judgment right okay

308
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,700
adding the salt we're gonna rub all this

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,620
stuff together anyway so it's fine if

310
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,500
it's not evenly distributed at this

311
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,019
point right so I said before that you

312
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,779
should not be heating seed oils

313
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,399
understand the process by which seed

314
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,040
oils are being manufactured so in the

315
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,600
start I said see those are called RBD

316
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,760
oils right refined bleached and

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
deodorized oils understand that each of

318
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,500
those processes is a high heat process

319
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
and these oils shouldn't be subjected to

320
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,839
heat in the first place for example the

321
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,839
process of deodorization so what's going

322
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,540
on here right so most seed oils are

323
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,700
toxic or are inedible in a natural form

324
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,160
for example canola oil or it's called

325
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,720
rapeseed oil it's literally toxic

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,279
straight out of the plant like even if

327
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,079
you have the best extraction techniques

328
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,600
and you only use cold pressing or

329
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,060
expeller pressed canola oil is still

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
toxic so canola oil is a no-go like you

331
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,540
should never have it under whatever

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,339
circumstance and then the refining

333
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,440
process you subject it to a process

334
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,300
called deodorization which removes the

335
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
bad smells from this product at a

336
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,100
temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,399
which is more than sufficient to oxidize

338
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,260
and make this stuff literally well I

339
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,639
don't want to make claims I cannot prove

340
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,519
so I don't want to say that a

341
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,620
carcinogenic oil but it has been proven

342
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,800
that these oils upon Heating and

343
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,500
reheating do formaldehydes such as 4-H

344
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,420
and E so you can make all that what you

345
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,000
want I personally will never touch

346
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,940
canola oil coming back to here so

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,279
chicken adds some garlic powder

348
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,519
oh [ __ ] that's a little bit too much but

349
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,760
it's fine turmeric

350
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,200
we have ginger powder and you see how

351
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,779
generous I'm being with all this stuff

352
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,240
it tastes good so why wouldn't I be and

353
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,980
also I have Cayenne Red Pepper so this

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,079
is so the other ones I would definitely

355
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,240
recommend you add them the red pepper is

356
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,160
optional for sure it's going to add a

357
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,160
lot of spice so if you don't like spice

358
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,779
don't add any Cayenne Red Pepper because

359
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,820
you're going to add actual like ground

360
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,160
pepper anyway so you don't need this

361
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,100
step I personally like it with a little

362
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,440
bit of spice so I'm okay with adding a

363
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,420
small bit of cayenne pepper that's more

364
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,940
or less what we need so I won't add the

365
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,040
pepper right now because if I heat this

366
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,959
this pepper just burns so I add the

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,339
pepper at the end actually I've already

368
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,980
added everything I need for this

369
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,180
probably not enough though I'll mix it

370
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,639
up and I'll see I'll make my judgment

371
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,760
and if the oxidization issue wasn't bad

372
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,700
enough look at what these oils and fats

373
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,279
are stored in if you notice olive oil

374
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,380
often comes in these dark glass bottles

375
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,139
why is that it's because first olive oil

376
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,899
is expensive and people expect quality

377
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,160
from olive oil so the manufacturers put

378
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,560
them in glass bottles to prevent

379
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,839
oxidization you understand oxidization

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,459
can be caused not just by heat but also

381
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,260
by light that's why the dark glass

382
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,839
bottles and then of course the saturated

383
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,760
fats they're already in glass so that's

384
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,940
fine I have no issue with that but look

385
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,060
at your seed oils almost all seed oils

386
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,540
are packaged in Plastics and here's the

387
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:05,100
problem the Plastics contain either a

388
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,680
bisphenol so BPA BPS bpas BPF different

389
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,720
kinds of bisphenols which are all highly

390
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,420
estrogenic substances which mess up your

391
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,480
hormones in a terrible way that's one

392
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,459
thing but even if somehow they had a

393
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,899
plastic which didn't contain BPA which

394
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,519
is unlikely because this is the cheapest

395
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,040
kind of plastic it would still contain

396
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,100
talates and talits are also endocrine

397
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,260
disrupting I would be very surprised

398
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,880
indeed if any seed all came in plastic

399
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,699
which was free of those I would say it's

400
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,380
impossible it's unlikely so here's

401
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:37,199
what's happened estrogenic substances

402
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:40,800
all of them are fat soluble that is they

403
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,920
dissolve in fats they dissolve in oils

404
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,300
so when you store these oils in a

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
plastic container what do you think is

406
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,839
going to happen the estrogenic

407
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,540
substances are going to seep into the

408
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,120
oil and estrogenics are not destroyed by

409
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,579
heat so when you consume canola oil

410
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,800
grape seed oil sunflower oil mustard

411
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,800
sesame oil coming from these plastic

412
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,540
containers you are consuming estrogenic

413
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,399
substances you are there's no question

414
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,079
about it that's another reason why you

415
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,000
should prefer the saturated fats or

416
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,100
olive oil in your cooking rather than

417
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,620
the seed oils so you want to heard the

418
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,060
term called trans fats and by the way it

419
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,320
looks like I didn't season my chicken

420
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,720
enough so I'm going to add a little bit

421
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,339
more trans fats you've heard of the term

422
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,500
trans fats you know the trans fats are

423
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,680
bad but you know there was a time in

424
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,320
which the science and the media

425
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,540
everybody was saying that trans fats

426
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,060
were good and you should have more of

427
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,839
them so understand that Procter and

428
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,420
Gamble is a massively wealthy company so

429
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,220
here's what they did they took seed oils

430
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,199
in fact they took cotton seed oil which

431
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,060
is one of the worst seed oils they took

432
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,339
cotton seed oil which is an industrial

433
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,139
lubricant it's literally used to oil

434
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,540
machine parts it's not fit for human

435
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,759
consumption and they subjected this oil

436
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,199
to some something called hydrogenation

437
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,060
later on they come up with something

438
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,680
called partial Hydro hydrogenation but

439
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,620
they subjected it called to something

440
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,500
called hydrogenation which causes the

441
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,160
substance this liquid to become a solid

442
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,260
all right and they give it a name called

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,679
Crisco Crisco it comes from get this

444
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:19,860
crystallized cotton seed oil Crisco and

445
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,500
this stuff is toxic it's literally made

446
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,179
of trans fats no human or animal should

447
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,419
be consuming this stuff but the

448
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,760
marketing campaign was on point they

449
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,260
convinced everybody that trans fats Now

450
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,100
understand something about trans fats

451
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,919
trans fats don't exist in nature or the

452
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,799
existing Trace quantities only no living

453
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,760
species is equipped to deal with trans

454
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,160
fats and crisco was sold you know to

455
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,419
moms and kids ate this stuff like no

456
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,940
human should be eating this stuff or

457
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,059
Procter and Gamble they said [ __ ] you

458
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,980
give me money so they literally forced

459
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,620
or didn't force but you know use their

460
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,660
marketing Wing to sell this stuff which

461
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,400
literally even an animal should not be

462
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,320
eating that's the story of Crisco so I

463
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,380
the reason I bring that up so it trans

464
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,900
fats have now almost been banned you can

465
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,080
barely use trans fats but the story I

466
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,000
want you to focus on so trans fats the

467
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,919
scientists said it was good the media

468
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,140
said it was good it turns out it was bad

469
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,840
all right poorly unsaturated fatty acids

470
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,760
pufas again it's the same story The

471
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,980
Scientist said it's good the media said

472
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,919
it's good but the emerging research is

473
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,559
showing that it's not good at all and

474
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,840
and this is a whole story about

475
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,000
cholesterol so in the 90 like the late

476
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,100
1900s right there was a huge fear about

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,320
heart disease I believe President

478
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,360
Eisenhower I think he died of heart

479
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,860
disease so the question of heart disease

480
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,440
was on everybody's mind you know how do

481
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,360
we prevent heart disease and all this so

482
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,100
the American Heart Association which I

483
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,919
talked about before they come out and

484
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,559
they prove that the lower cholesterol

485
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,419
means lower heart disease risk which is

486
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,059
not a claim which I actually believe in

487
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,820
what happens then they find this link

488
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:06,179
that polysaturated and fatty acids

489
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,160
reduce cholesterol so there it is you

490
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,660
know literally thousands and millions of

491
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
Americans bought into this stuff and not

492
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,799
just Americans obviously worldwide

493
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,080
Procter Gamble is a multinational

494
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,299
multi-nation company massive profits

495
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,179
from this fraudulent marketing campaign

496
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm also going to add bay leaves which

497
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,059
is optional I'm just adding it because

498
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,460
you know I haven't you don't really need

499
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,640
this for this recipe I'm adding some

500
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,640
star anise and I'm adding a stick of

501
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,919
cinnamon because I want this meal to be

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
S tier you don't really need all this

503
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,120
stuff you can make a perfectly good

504
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,880
chicken drumstick with half this stuff

505
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,500
you only really need the pepper and salt

506
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,220
everything else is optional so I'm going

507
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,200
to give this a nice rub one last time

508
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,120
and you have two options on how to cook

509
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,820
this you can either do it on a stove top

510
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,640
and that's fine but I'm going to put it

511
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,799
in the oven just because it's easier and

512
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,480
besides why do I have this what kind of

513
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,100
soap are you using to wash your hands

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,039
check your ingredients list if it

515
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,980
contains ethyl or metal paraben

516
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,299
you need new soap as I wait for my

517
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,440
chicken to get made there's a few more

518
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,360
things I don't talk to talk to you about

519
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,720
so should you never have sunflower oil

520
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,039
or sesame oil not necessarily so I was

521
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,480
talking about the extraction processes

522
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,419
there's other kinds of extraction

523
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,820
processes which are much less common you

524
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:26,520
can find sunflower oil or sesame oil

525
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,919
from expeller pressed so it'll say on

526
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,559
the bottle expeller pressed or cold

527
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,960
pressed and that's fine if you and if

528
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,539
you use those I'd have less of a problem

529
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,940
with those polyunsaturated fatty acids

530
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,220
because they haven't been destroyed by

531
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,780
these high temperature processes so I

532
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,280
would still not use them for cooking but

533
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,380
I could use them as a drizzle on

534
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,299
something else and same thing for sesame

535
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,160
oil sunflower and sesame oil are not the

536
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,380
worst the problem with these is the

537
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,260
processing and the refining with things

538
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,799
like cotton seed oil corn oil soybean

539
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,360
oil and even canola oil these even if

540
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,039
they were expeller pressed I would

541
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,120
highly not recommend them these two are

542
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,539
a little bit different and what about

543
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,539
avocado oil or Mac Academia nut oil yeah

544
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,640
these are fine too avocado oil olive oil

545
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,440
and macadamia nut oil are actually

546
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,539
monounsaturated so you can use them to

547
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,980
cook if you wanted to let me check if

548
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,140
this is done

549
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,360
all right here's a tip on how you should

550
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,640
use your oven so if you have an oven you

551
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,740
have a broil setting so to make chicken

552
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,179
easy instead of setting you know the

553
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,039
temperature and the duration and all

554
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,960
that you just put it on broil you wait

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,880
for it to have this Browning and

556
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,159
charring you flip him and then you put

557
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,080
them back it's that easy you don't need

558
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,240
to sit there and try to find out like

559
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,480
what temperature is ideal this is the

560
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,520
superior Method All tastes good oh yeah

561
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,679
it has the kick I know my seasoning is

562
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,679
on point boys and it goes

563
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,039
I'll let it be for a couple more minutes

564
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,740
we talked about science philosophy

565
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,799
observation that still leaves us with

566
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,320
intuition and this may be the most

567
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,679
controversial or important thing in this

568
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,000
video my intuition I I used to think I

569
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,100
used to defer to science you know the

570
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,419
science is what they say then I believe

571
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,340
the science I don't believe my

572
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,340
intuitions I was that kind of guy not

573
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,860
anymore nowadays I trust my gut I trust

574
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,620
my instincts I trust my intuition about

575
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,260
everything including diet including

576
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,240
interactions with people including you

577
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,400
know the choices I make the videos I

578
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,919
make all that I do trust my judgment

579
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,240
because I'm in a better place now I have

580
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,980
good mental health I have good physical

581
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,900
health and I have no problem with

582
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,940
trusting my judgment because judgment

583
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,980
comes from evolutionary wisdom

584
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,080
programmed into us over thousands and

585
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,539
millions of years why would I not trust

586
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,700
it so what does my intuition say I'll

587
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,340
give you a short story so I was doing my

588
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,740
research for this video and one of the

589
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,919
videos I saw on YouTube which is the pro

590
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,840
seed oil the presenter of that video he

591
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,900
made an interesting argument he said

592
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,860
that in online right-wing groups

593
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,080
everybody there hates seed oil and they

594
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,039
the low saturated fats and the reason

595
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,539
why these right wing online guys

596
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,299
masculine toxic masculinity type guys

597
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:16,559
hate seed oils is because

598
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:20,039
they associate meat with the hunt

599
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,679
and the hunt with war and all these are

600
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:26,100
right-wing topics that is associated

601
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,440
with toxic masculinity and then these

602
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,960
guys hate seed oils because seed oils

603
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,000
are you know bird food and birds are

604
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,980
effeminate and that's why they hate seed

605
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,539
oils and that's why they allow meat and

606
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,820
dairy products because that comes from

607
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,460
the hunt and and farming and all the

608
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,460
masculine stuff and he used this as an

609
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,220
argument for seed oils he said we

610
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,080
shouldn't be toxic masculine and we

611
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,700
should prefer the seed oils because the

612
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
science said so when you just trust the

613
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,600
science

614
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,299
it's interesting when I saw that I was

615
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,679
amused because his little story about

616
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,900
you know the right-wing guys and the

617
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,760
toxic masculinity type guys preferring

618
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,380
saturated fats because of their

619
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,500
association with the hunt

620
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,020
that appeals to me I don't care what a

621
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,120
random YouTuber has to say who wants to

622
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,340
call me toxic masculine that's fine I

623
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,980
don't care that story appeals to me to

624
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,200
my intuition It Feels Right humans were

625
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,240
a hunting species we were pastoralists

626
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,460
we literally made this stuff for

627
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,380
thousands of years this is the new stuff

628
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,820
we didn't have freaking seed oils

629
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,340
thousands of years ago this is

630
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,440
newfangled this is tradition my

631
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,500
intuition says this is the healthy stuff

632
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,320
so the science is a little bit iffy

633
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,780
because the predominant government

634
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,299
sanctioned consensus is that Cedars are

635
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,520
good and saturated fats are bad so the

636
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,659
science is 50 50. I mean I would I would

637
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,700
even say the science is actually in

638
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,799
favor of seed oils if you look at all

639
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,120
the papers so you can make if you want

640
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,400
to trust the science you go right ahead

641
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,340
buddy the science the philosophy the

642
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,159
philosophy says suspect new inventions

643
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,320
until proven healthy so the philosophy

644
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,900
is on the side of saturated fats

645
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,780
observation my observations saturated

646
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,640
fats are winter clear as day then we

647
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,380
have the intuition my intuition says

648
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,120
saturated fats are the way to go your

649
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,039
intuition might be different and for all

650
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,860
those reasons for the science philosophy

651
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,520
intuition and observation I prefer

652
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:24,539
saturated fats and mono unsaturated fats

653
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,700
over seed oils any day now time to check

654
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,960
up on my chicken let's see what happened

655
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,640
here

656
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,220
I'm going to grab these out and I'm

657
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,799
going to finish my chicken with a little

658
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,299
bit of where is that duck fat I see that

659
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,360
it's getting a little bit dry

660
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,580
so I'm going to rub some duck fat on it

661
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,340
before it gets too dry and then I'll put

662
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,380
it back in for a little bit more so

663
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,080
we've already established the seed oils

664
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,240
bad saturated fats good that's fine but

665
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,880
how do you actually avoid them because

666
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,220
they're everywhere you don't understand

667
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,200
just by making better buying choices

668
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,820
doesn't make you safe so yeah you could

669
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,220
just buy the better ones and cook in

670
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:06,360
your home but literally every single

671
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:09,000
fast food uses reheated seed oils all of

672
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,440
them all of them use reheated seed oil

673
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,240
you think Chipotle is healthy because

674
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,179
they have like rice and chicken but that

675
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,220
chicken was cooked in seed oils and and

676
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,740
it's not just seed oils there's hundreds

677
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,200
of different examples candy bars snack

678
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,880
cakes I actually have a little list of

679
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,179
things which seed oils are present in

680
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,559
snack cakes chips margarine cereals

681
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:34,980
dressing Ranch fake meat most candy bars

682
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,679
mayonnaise is basically just soy soy oil

683
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,480
and it's emulsified

684
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,400
I'll make a list I'll put in the

685
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,080
description all the stuff you should be

686
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,559
avoiding but I think I've made my point

687
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,720
avoid seed oils go for saturated so I've

688
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,419
gotten my chicken out of the oven

689
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,980
so it's been in the oven for about 10

690
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,840
minutes so that cooks the chicken

691
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,059
completely so it's all fully cooked now

692
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,179
all the way down to the bone but I like

693
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,039
the Char and the the skin to be nice and

694
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,460
burnt and tasty so what I'm going to do

695
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,620
now is take my duck fat again and grab a

696
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,200
new spoon I'm gonna finish it off on the

697
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,640
stove top so this cast iron is like

698
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,760
really hot so I'm gonna have to be

699
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,039
careful with it take my stove top and

700
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,600
I'm gonna get it to medium high so just

701
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,640
between medium and high it's going to

702
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,460
take a little bit to heat up so in that

703
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,679
time I'm going to get my duck fat I'm

704
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,419
gonna this is my third tablespoon of

705
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,520
duck fat by the way if you're counting

706
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,279
and you might be thinking oh my God this

707
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,100
is so many calories doesn't matter if

708
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,740
you're having a good healthy lifestyle

709
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,200
which involves a lot of walking and

710
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,400
jogging and running and working out in

711
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,299
the gym

712
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Etc calories are easy to burn man it's

713
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,440
hard to gain weight if you eat the right

714
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,720
foods and eat the right fats it's

715
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,880
actually hard to gain weight it's hard

716
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,559
to get fat human beings aren't meant to

717
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,159
be fat that's the most unusual thing

718
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:01,140
it's so sad that in the modern day being

719
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,880
fat is the normal

720
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,120
it's actually really hard to get fat

721
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,679
think about it in caveman times you you

722
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,360
would really struggle to get fat even if

723
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,120
you tried you would fail

724
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,059
so here we are in the modern world in

725
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,940
which getting fat is the normal there it

726
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,400
is that's the color I want to see this

727
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,860
is the stuff I want to see all right I

728
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,860
have my plate of chicken right here

729
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,860
I'm gonna just take a take a bit of it

730
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,059
