1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
years after its first gay pride Edition

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,880
the mainstream narrative is that the

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,059
rise of the presence of LGBT individuals

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,960
is because of the heroic efforts of the

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,920
activists this is not true this is not

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,680
true because this phenomenon is just as

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,220
true for humans as it is in the animal

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,560
kingdom across the planets all animals

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,840
especially the marine animals who are

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,160
most exposed to endocrine disrupting

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,780
chemicals or exhibiting anomalies

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,940
anomalies in both their physiology so

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,520
their body their reproductive parts but

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,219
also their behaviors this is very much

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,460
in line with the most recent science to

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,100
do with endocrine disrupting chemicals

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,579
for many species this is an existential

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,000
threat and so it is with humans sperm

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,000
quality and quantity have dropped by 50

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,680
in just 50 years in another 50 years

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,700
it's going to drop by another 50 percent

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,340
most men will not get to be fathers only

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,619
a selective group of men who have the

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,200
resources and the knowledge will have

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,979
the ability to Father kids and it's even

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,100
worse it's even worse for women the rate

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,740
of miscarriage that is the child dying

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,220
in the womb has almost doubled in that

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,960
same time frame imagine how terrible a

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,000
miscarriage truly is the room and the

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,780
mother who literally has to carry the

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,960
dead corpse of her unborn child

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,180
to birth imagine the level of trauma

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,360
that inflicts on a woman and this is

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,700
only getting worse year by year as we're

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,240
exposed to more and more toxins in our

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,220
environment we are all suffering men are

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,799
being faced with depression at an

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,560
unprecedented rate they are engaging in

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,899
self-harm and even self-delution at a

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,299
rate never before seen on the face of

42
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,759
the Earth in the history of mankind and

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,399
all we do is we harp about mental health

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,160
awareness week without connecting this

45
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,840
issue back to testosterone the science

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,879
on this is very clear and has been for

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,260
decades and here we are walking around

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,480
with the green ribbon because we're

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,020
aware of mental health this is not the

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,680
way we're in this together men women

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,860
liberals and conservatives straight and

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,620
even the LGBT community because they are

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,140
not to blame for any of this they were

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,300
as infants as infants in the womb they

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,640
were exposed to these endocrine

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,760
disrupting chemicals how can we possibly

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,319
have any hate or any animosity towards

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,180
these individuals it doesn't make sense

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,340
they are not the enemy they never were

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,440
the enemy and they don't deserve any

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,360
blame for this the Liberals and the

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,540
conservatives are tearing the nation

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,540
apart while the real villains laugh in

64
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,720
the distance everybody is struggling men

65
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,540
with depression women with anxiety the

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,900
LGBT individuals with their own identity

67
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,319
issues we were poisoned at Birth and

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,680
after birth why are young boys

69
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,900
prescribed with mind-numbing drugs just

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,180
because they act in the exact way that

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,640
nature prescribed them to act in why are

72
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,819
young girls being prescribed with birth

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,920
control drugs just to cure their acne do

74
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,800
you know what is meant by bread and

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,440
circuses the Roman emperors would spend

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,120
their entire treasury on free handouts

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,659
they would spend it on meaningless

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,060
entertainment because if the populace if

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,980
the citizenry knew of the crimes they

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,860
had committed it would be their head on

81
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,620
a spike the multinational companies and

82
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,840
the government are not here for us and

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,760
the scientists will not be able to solve

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,319
the problem because it'll be too late by

85
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,780
the time they devise some magical

86
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,900
solution it's up to us to take things

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,180
into our own hands we must learn to make

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,459
better buying decisions we must

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,519
understand what is toxic and what is not

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,940
we must spur the growth of a whole new

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,220
economy we must start with ourself our

92
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,900
friends and our families fixing

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,120
ourselves mentally physically and

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,540
spiritually and hormonally this is not

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,100
some concealed attack on the lgbtq I'm

96
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,199
somewhat of a Libertarian in the sense

97
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,760
that if you leave me alone I'll leave

98
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
you alone but I understand that some

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,919
people genuinely dislike or even hate

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
the LGBT but what happens if you are one

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,120
of those individuals and your child is

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,620
born intersex what are you gonna do hate

103
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,780
him hate her

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,419
good luck with that and what if you're a

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,160
hardcore feminist woman and you have a

106
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,680
miscarriage because of exposure to the

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,960
edcs what are you gonna do blame the

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,880
patriarchy I'd like to see you try you

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,460
see we are truly in this together

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,860
whether we like it or not we are on the

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,960
same ship and it is sinking fast they

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,080
don't care if you're black or white

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,540
Latino Or Hispanic or gay or straight

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,520
nothing matters so long as you're a good

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,220
Cog in the machine but imagine this

116
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,740
imagine a society where we are all

117
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,040
immune to psychological operations we're

118
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,979
all maxed out on our health both mental

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,139
physical and spiritual and hormonal

120
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,940
imagine we're raising kids to be even

121
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,680
more strong and resilient than we ever

122
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,440
were imagine we could put down our

123
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,139
differences just for a moment and gaze

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,780
upon the powers that be they will

125
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,890
tremble in fear for we are their worst

126
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,420
nightmare

127
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,700
