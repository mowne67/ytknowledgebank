1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
I worked for Hamza for about three to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,960
four months as his thinker strategizer

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,040
his visualizer so this is a very

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
interesting job one of the most

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,179
interesting jobs I've ever done at some

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,340
point the YouTube algorithm decided that

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,379
I needed to watch hanza every other

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,480
recommended video was this guy's face

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,920
wearing a bathrobe on my feet and I

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,900
didn't really like his titles or

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,580
anything but after seeing him so so many

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,380
times I had to click on it I went

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,000
through the Hamza Rabbit Hole I watched

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,680
a whole bunch of his content really

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,119
liked it I really liked his message I

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,859
was really convinced by him I found that

17
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,079
he was genuine and eventually he makes a

18
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,960
community post saying he wants a thinker

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
so he wants somebody for strategy and to

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
be a Visionary and have a vision for his

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,420
channel somebody to discuss things with

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,040
and plan with I thought this was the

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,480
perfect job for me and if you don't mind

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm going to be preparing my breakfast

25
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,820
while I talk to you about how Hamza is

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,800
in real life outside of YouTube so I

27
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,840
filled up the application for his

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,280
thinker position he literally was hiring

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,020
somebody to think for him hear me out

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,539
it's not as stupid as you think so Hamza

31
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,399
is a very very intelligent guy he's much

32
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,960
more intelligent than he seems just by

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,360
looking at his videos he has a very

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,799
strategic mind and he has a very good

35
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,720
understanding of his emotional

36
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,939
capability and how to use that and

37
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,860
balance it out with logic so anyhow so I

38
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,420
sent in the application out and I try to

39
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,880
make the application as good as possible

40
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,340
I talk about my experiences in college

41
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,020
in traveling the military and a hundred

42
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,000
other things which show that I can

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,560
actually help humza strategize I told

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
him about the books I've read the things

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,520
I've written and my goals and Ambitions

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
for the future and Hamza really liked it

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,939
so he sends me an email hey I saw your

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
application and I really liked it would

49
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,240
you like to do a video call just like

50
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,979
that here was a big YouTube channel I

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,420
think he had half a million followers at

52
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,460
the time and he was willing to do a

53
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,560
video call what happened is I did this

54
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,720
video call with him and he asked me why

55
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,520
he thinks his movement is important so I

56
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,100
told him the truth I told him perhaps

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,280
the most important mission in the world

58
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,740
right now is this crisis of masculinity

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,720
to use the cliched phrase that men

60
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,920
simply are not taking responsibility for

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,659
their actions and not taking

62
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,820
responsibility for the con consequences

63
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,159
because of this there is massive

64
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,439
depression mental illness all kinds of

65
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,479
societal problems that we see today my

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,459
case was of course there's big problems

67
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,980
like climate change climate change

68
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,599
climate change income inequality 100

69
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,819
other things that you can talk about but

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,099
you can only solve those problems if you

71
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,260
have a strong Society to begin with so

72
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,360
you need a society of well-disciplined

73
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,160
responsible determined men who can

74
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,379
actually fix the problems that we have

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,120
so Hamza really liked the logic of that

76
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,920
obviously because that's his brand right

77
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,040
he does absolutely believe in his brand

78
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,379
so I get the job I'm harms a thinker how

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,640
it worked is we would do video calls I'm

80
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,800
going to put this piece of bread in the

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,800
toaster oven we do video calls every

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,959
week or so discussing strategy so when

83
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,360
we first started this was when we

84
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,940
realized that the Jeffrey and Adonis

85
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,980
intro right it used to be that Hamza

86
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
kind of views Jeffrey as the enemy now

87
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,340
Jeffrey is a thing which we should not

88
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,440
be like we should kind of hate and

89
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,819
Adonis is the aspirational figure but we

90
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,800
discussed this at length and we realize

91
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,780
well Jeffrey is not really the enemy at

92
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,060
all Jeffrey is a victim of a broken

93
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,160
Society what I mean is the structures of

94
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,080
society that exist today have no support

95
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,280
for young men growing up and finding

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,500
their identity which is of course

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,060
hamza's entire message so Jeffrey is not

98
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,800
the enemy Jeffrey is actually the

99
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,840
audience themselves and in fact it is

100
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Hamza himself when he was younger so he

101
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,519
discussed this and now instead of doing

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,280
Adonis good Jeffrey bad type intros we

103
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,500
would do Adonis helps Jeffrey improve

104
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,000
his life or rather Jeffrey looks at the

105
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,379
honest and improves his life or

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,180
something along those lines instead of

107
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,099
making Jeffrey the enemy we treat

108
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,019
Jeffrey as a friend and every single

109
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,060
Jeffrey is a Adonis in the making so he

110
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,680
had a better understanding of our intro

111
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,379
when we had those discussions then

112
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,420
Andrew Tate decided to blow up

113
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,099
flip the burners dumb this is what

114
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,480
Andrew tape was he was not in jail or

115
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,340
anything you know he was doing very well

116
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,379
for himself on Tick Tock and YouTube and

117
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,940
everything was just blowing up and Hamza

118
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,500
and undertake kind of share a similar

119
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,940
audience of young men who want to

120
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,159
improve themselves so the question was

121
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,780
should harms associate with Andrew Tate

122
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,280
see Andrew trade is highly controversial

123
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,659
compared to Hamza Hamza is talking about

124
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,519
wholesome things like mental health

125
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,140
physical health spiritual health and

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,480
undertale is just talking about

127
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,340
cars and smoking cigars and has very

128
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,900
controversial opinions on women and

129
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,700
everything the question for Hamza was

130
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,320
Andrew Tate and him share a similar

131
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,019
space and by the way guys you're going

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,699
to learn how to make a very good bomb

133
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,979
omelette so I'm going to make my

134
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,860
omelette with ghee actually if you're

135
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,840
using oil top at least use butter and if

136
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,820
you want to be really elite elite level

137
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,080
omelette you got to use ghee Elite

138
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,040
omelette coming up and of course if you

139
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,259
want to make a good omelette you got to

140
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,780
get the best quality eggs I get these

141
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,280
happy egg company eggs they're really

142
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,600
good but anyway where was I and rotate

143
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,100
so the question becomes a question of

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,540
strategy because Andrew Tate was

145
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,120
unpredictable we didn't know what he was

146
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,040
going to do next or saying X so if Hamza

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
decides to associate his brand with

148
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
Andrew Tate's brand and Andrew Tate does

149
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
something stupid slash very

150
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,780
controversial that could reflect badly

151
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,419
on hamza's wholesome image my advice to

152
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,740
him was don't associate with Andrew Tate

153
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,840
publicly because it was just too much

154
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,220
risk we didn't know him personally we

155
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,080
didn't know what he's going to do and

156
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,120
besides Andrew Tate was very successful

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,040
before he even became a influencer

158
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,600
Andrew Tate made his money before he

159
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,860
came to YouTube on Tick Tock that's not

160
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
the case for Hamza hamza's

161
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,699
infrastructure depends on YouTube he

162
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,979
wasn't Rich before YouTube so we decided

163
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,020
not to deal with Andrew tatron to

164
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,600
publicly support or talk about Andrew

165
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,240
Tate but in the end Hamza disagreed with

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,800
me and I'm glad he did because I made it

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,660
such that it was a question of strategy

168
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,580
you know what's best for hamza's image

169
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,979
what's best for Hamza as a brand it was

170
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,780
never for me about hamza's honesty and

171
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,580
the fact of the matter is Hamza did like

172
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,900
Andrew Tate's content and I did too I

173
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,360
don't agree with everything Andrew Tate

174
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,740
says but his mindset on success

175
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,479
connections and networking are really

176
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,940
really good and Hamza believed the same

177
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,560
so Hamza according to my advice did not

178
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,060
talk about annotate at all but

179
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,800
eventually he did break with my advice

180
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,479
which is good and he talks about how

181
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,520
Andrew Tate is the most misunderstood

182
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,440
man and actually supports undertale in

183
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,539
public now big Divergence from where he

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,820
was I'm glad he was able to do that we

185
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,520
spoke about monetization of course we

186
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,280
talked about how to make money so Hamza

187
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,440
really doesn't want to be like all the

188
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,240
other influencers who just sell and

189
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,860
make money I was of the opinion that

190
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,660
selling stuff so long as the thing

191
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,460
provides genuine value to your customer

192
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,340
it's not a bad thing and wouldn't harm

193
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,800
His Image but see harms us right if he

194
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,600
sold low ticket items he would hurt his

195
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,880
image in the long run and I was

196
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,860
incorrect hats off to Hamza for having

197
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,199
his own thoughts and not just following

198
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,000
whatever I said so in the end Hamza did

199
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,979
not actually sell any low ticket items

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,380
he didn't sell any low ticket courses he

201
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,940
sells one extremely high ticket course

202
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,400
which I don't think you guys even know

203
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,100
about but he sells a course on how to

204
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,840
have better sex literally Hamza has a

205
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,120
sex course a high ticket sex course

206
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,280
which is cells not publicly like not on

207
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,900
his main Channel or anything but only on

208
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,000
his like download channels if you're on

209
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,500
his email list you might have access to

210
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,360
it and even then it's not a sure thing

211
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,740
so he has a high ticket course but

212
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,419
doesn't publicize it at all because he

213
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,560
doesn't want the negative image he

214
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,840
really really cares about the

215
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,759
genuineness and honesty of his brand so

216
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,340
when I was working with thumbs up I had

217
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,319
to actually report for a two-week stint

218
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,600
of training with the army so I was gone

219
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,340
you know I was in the army barracks in

220
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,500
the cam training and I would still be

221
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,940
able to find the time to talk to Hamza

222
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
do these video calls and discuss

223
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,759
strategy because even though I was

224
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,500
really tired and I was doing this Army

225
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,240
 I actually found so much value from

226
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,560
Hamza that I decided to sacrifice a

227
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
little bit of my sleep even though I was

228
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,860
tired I would still talk to him help him

229
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,139
if I could that's how much I respect the

230
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,240
guy I would not do that for anybody else

231
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,800
except for Hamza so I am a fan of him

232
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,240
there's no question about it he brought

233
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,580
a lot of value to me and I'm really

234
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,660
proud of having worked with him I'm kind

235
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,940
of sad that we don't work with each

236
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,860
other anymore so what is Hamza like off

237
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,139
camera you might be surprised to know

238
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,900
this but Hamza is literally the same guy

239
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,639
AI on and off camera is actually legit

240
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,560
he's actually the real deal that's my

241
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,479
assessment after working for multiple

242
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,160
months with him no one can make a fake

243
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,900
appearance last for three months so I

244
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,520
did multiple calls with him and he is

245
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,620
really the guy behind the camera so what

246
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,199
I mean by that is he genuinely cares

247
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,120
about the upliftment of young men in

248
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,979
today's generation no question in my

249
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
mind that At His Highest priority so

250
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,580
when we realized that Jeffrey was not

251
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,319
the enemy we tried to find out who the

252
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,139
enemy really was and our conclusion was

253
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,139
the enemy was social media and porn so

254
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,360
we decided to go after social media just

255
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,819
talk and expose the way social media

256
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,319
apps and channels manipulate our minds

257
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,780
and we were making videos about this

258
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,580
consistently for at least two weeks just

259
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,080
talking about Instagram and this also

260
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,699
the time in which Hamza got banned off

261
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,319
Instagram actually and it was really

262
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,240
interesting because Hamza makes a video

263
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,459
against Instagram and just two days

264
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,659
later he gets banned by insta and he

265
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,279
didn't do anything he didn't post

266
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,020
anything inappropriate or anything like

267
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,700
that so it seems to be that somebody at

268
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,080
Instagram saw this video and saw the

269
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,420
power that he could have and decided to

270
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,980
to ban him on Insta till now we have no

271
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,320
idea why he got banned at that time

272
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,700
eventually Hamza gets banned on more and

273
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,399
more channels I believe he's banned on

274
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,980
Discord now and before he was banned on

275
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,260
skillshare so his skillshare course was

276
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,700
making him about 50 of his income at the

277
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,860
time when I was working with him so when

278
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,600
he got banned off of skillshare he had

279
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,820
to cut some employees off and that was

280
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,640
why I don't work with him anymore after

281
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,980
watching hamza's latest video I realized

282
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,140
how far he has come in just two years

283
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,000
just two years this man didn't even have

284
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,220
a channel in two years he not only

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,040
created a successful YouTube channel and

286
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,560
a business he managed a whole team he

287
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,600
started a movement of a million plus men

288
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,519
who genuinely want to get better at life

289
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,320
he did everything without much

290
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,760
controversy I mean he had that one beef

291
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,899
with sneaker but even that's nothing

292
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,060
compared to a lot of what these

293
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,399
influencers do so it really goes to show

294
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,200
you how a normal man an intelligent man

295
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,360
mind you was able to go from almost

296
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,640
nothing to so much having such a massive

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,040
Global impact in just two years so it

298
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,260
inspires me it tells me that I have no

299
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,180
idea I cannot imagine where I will be

300
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,800
that should be what hamza's story is to

301
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
you is a story of inspiration of how

302
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,339
much you can accomplish when you focus

303
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,959
yourself on one goal on one purpose and

304
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,300
do it consistently over the long time

305
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,620
period and Hamza he really proved that

306
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
you can do it everybody was talking

307
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,279
about how YouTube is saturated social

308
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,019
media is saturated but no the man just

309
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,060
went for it and in two years he built

310
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,279
this whole empire of wholesome good

311
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,320
advice for young men that is such a

312
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,120
difficult yet Noble Pursuit that he has

313
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,620
absolutely succeeded in and watching his

314
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,540
latest video when he talks about how

315
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,399
that outer layer of purpose of helping

316
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,740
other men has kind of dissolved and he

317
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,899
needs to re-revisit that all that

318
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,820
concept comes from David data's the way

319
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,560
of the superior man that book was very

320
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,000
influential on Hamza and a lot of men

321
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,040
including myself one of the principles

322
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,140
from that book is there are layers of

323
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,240
purpose every single person on this

324
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,160
planet has a purpose but the purpose is

325
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,779
not just one thing you work on a purpose

326
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,519
for a good amount of time and when you

327
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,500
reach a certain level of success it

328
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,480
falls off and then a deeper level of

329
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,579
purpose is revealed to you that is what

330
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,200
has happened to Hamza he has succeeded

331
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,180
as much as you can succeed on YouTube

332
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,820
could he get more followers probably yes

333
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,640
but his outer level of purpose has been

334
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,620
met and he has found a deeper calling in

335
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,600
martial arts so I wish Hamza the

336
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,279
absolute best of luck and I hope he

337
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,140
really succeeds in finding what he's

338
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,420
looking for through martial arts his

339
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,339
journey has inspired me to start my own

340
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,140
I have no idea where this will lead me I

341
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,640
invite you to be a part of it and I well

342
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,100
first I gotta make my breakfast all

343
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,260
right you guys I was able to make my

344
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,420
breakfast and I'm gonna crack open a new

345
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,579
bottle olive oil and I would like to

346
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,820
conclude by saying what Hamza achieved

347
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,440
is not closed to any of us all of us can

348
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,959
take something from what Hamza has done

349
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,000
learn from it and even improve upon it

350
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,260
here's what was unique about Hamza and

351
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,839
how he was able to blow up he was

352
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,519
brutally honest about his problems and

353
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,100
he was brutally honest about his

354
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,019
failures he was radically open about his

355
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,120
worst insecurities he was talking about

356
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,860
how he had gynecomastia he was talking

357
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,320
about how he had man boobs like how many

358
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,880
guys have the courage to get on new to

359
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,579
be in front of thousands and thousands

360
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
of people and say I have man boobs I

361
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,339
don't know how to fix it I've always

362
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,959
felt insecure about it how many people

363
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,940
have the courage to say that the fact

364
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,040
that he was brutally honest was what

365
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,839
made his channel stand out and grow when

366
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,820
