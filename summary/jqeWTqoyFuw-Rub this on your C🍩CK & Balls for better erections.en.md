Magnesium lotion, when applied topically to the "shaft," is anecdotally reported to enhance morning erections. This observation stems from a bodybuilder's use of magnesium lotion for muscle soreness, leading to the hypothesis that topical application on the penile shaft could yield similar benefits. While no scientific evidence or published papers support this specific application, the underlying theory suggests that magnesium ions can reverse calcification in blood vessels. The hypothesis posits that magnesium seeps into the corpora cavernosa (sponge-like tissues responsible for erections when engorged with blood), reducing calcification in their blood vessels and thereby improving erectile strength.

Calcification in blood vessels is attributed to damaged LDL cholesterol. This damage occurs when polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are incorporated into the LDL structure, making them prone to oxidative damage. PUFAs are commonly found in cooking oils, often referred to as "seed oils," such as soybean oil, groundnut oil, and various fry oils used prevalently in fast food and many restaurants unless specific requests for butter or tallow are made.

A consistent lack of morning erections in men under 40 is suggested as a potential indicator of poor hormonal health. The first recommended step to address this is to get blood work done to serve as a diagnostic roadmap. Challenges associated with blood work include not knowing which biomarkers to test, perceiving it as expensive or requiring insurance, and not understanding the results. Assistance is offered to overcome these challenges through certified functional blood chemistry analysis.

Magnesium can also be consumed orally. A significant portion of the population is deficient in magnesium, with 15% being chronically deficient and over 50% falling below the recommended daily dosage. It is suggested that magnesium supplementation could help reverse heart disease. A specific daily protocol for oral magnesium supplementation is provided: 400 mg of magnesium citrate or malate in the morning, and 400 mg of magnesium glycinate or threonate at night, in addition to topical magnesium chloride lotion. This dosage is more than double the average daily allowance.

Beyond application to the penile shaft, magnesium lotion can be applied elsewhere on the body. For improving sleep, it is recommended to apply it to the base of the feet. This is thought to aid temperature regulation during sleep, as the evaporation of moisture from the lotion helps the body release heat. This protocol is considered beneficial for physically active individuals and "knowledge workers" who engage in deep work, as they are encouraged to treat themselves as "athletes of the mind."

The overall message emphasizes that maintaining good health in a "sick society" provides an "unfair advantage," and getting blood work done is presented as the initial step to leverage this advantage.
