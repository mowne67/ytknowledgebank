The summary discusses the hormonal effects of pornography and sex, particularly focusing on prolactin and its relationship with testosterone and social bonding.

**Pornography and Testosterone:**
*   Pornography is stated to cause a temporary 10% boost in testosterone.
*   However, this boost is immediately counteracted by a significant "prolactin spike."

**Prolactin's Role and Effects:**
*   **"Post-nut clarity":** Prolactin is identified as the hormone responsible for the post-orgasmic shutdown of sex drive.
*   **Negative Impacts:** It is described as clamping down ambition, energy, and momentum, leading to feelings of emptiness.
*   **Contrast with Testosterone:** Prolactin is presented as the opposite of testosterone. While testosterone makes effort and risk feel rewarding, prolactin makes them feel painful.
*   **Unsatisfied Emptiness:** If a prolactin spike occurs without a genuine partner (e.g., with random hookups or "pixels on a screen"), the resulting emptiness is not satiated and can lead to negative emotions and a "depressed hormone engine."
*   **Purpose:** Prolactin serves a valuable purpose in pair bonding with a wife or long-term partner, allowing her presence to fill the post-orgasmic emptiness.
*   **Parental Hormones:** Prolactin, along with serotonin and oxytocin, is part of a "peaceful hormone" profile that becomes dominant when a man is expecting to be a father. In this context, prolactin actively suppresses dopamine and testosterone, preventing a new father from seeking new partners and promoting a relaxed, "blissed out" state.

**Recommendations for Sexual Behavior:**
*   **Pornography:** A "zero tolerance policy" on porn is advocated. Individuals seeking sexual release are advised to use their imagination instead.
*   **Sex with a Partner:** Married men or those with a girlfriend are advised to consciously limit sex to two to three times per week to create "scarcity," which is believed to improve both partners' sex lives.
*   **Abstinence:** Complete abstinence will lead to nocturnal emissions (wet dreams), which are described as a normal and healthy way for the body to manage sexual energy, ideally occurring once a month or more.

**Controversial Hypothesis on Pheromones and Signaling:**
A hypothesis is presented that people can subconsciously detect if a man watches porn or engages in "meaningless sex" through a "pheromone system."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   An experiment is cited where women in long-term relationships could identify their partners' T-shirts by smell, and even without smell (after multiple washes), indicating subconscious recognition.
    *   Chemical signaling in nature is common: the presence of a sexually mature male can accelerate puberty in young females of a species, and a novel male can cause spontaneous miscarriage in pregnant females.
*   **Hypothesis Application:** It is proposed that a specific hormonal profile (high prolactin, low dopamine, low testosterone, high cortisol) resulting from frequent porn consumption or casual sex signals to women that the man is "pair-bonded" or a "stressed, pair-bonded father," making him unreceptive as a potential mate. This means frequent porn use or casual sex sends signals that deter women seeking a partner.

The overall conclusion is that to attract a "real woman," one must reject "virtual ones."
