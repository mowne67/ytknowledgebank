The 80/20 rule, while theoretically sound, is found difficult to apply in practice due to the challenge of identifying the crucial "20%." Instead, a "90/3 rule," or "The Big Three rule," is proposed as a more actionable mental model. This rule states that 90% of outcomes come from the top three causes, or, "what three sub-problems do you need to solve in order to solve the main problem?"

**Key Characteristics of The Big Three Rule:**
*   **Hierarchical and Recursive:** The rule can be applied recursively, meaning that once the "big three" sub-problems of a main problem are identified, each of those sub-problems can then be broken down into their own "big three," and so on, until actionable steps are revealed.
*   **Problem Decomposition:** It breaks down complex problems into manageable components, clarifying strategy and action steps.
*   **Origin:** The Big Three rule is derived from McKinsey's MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).
    *   **Mutually Exclusive (ME):** Ideally, the sub-parts of the breakdown should not overlap. While perfect mutual exclusivity isn't always achievable (e.g., in health, diet can affect exercise), the goal is to minimize interactions.
    *   **Collectively Exhaustive (CE):** Traditionally, MECE requires that all sub-parts add up to 100% of the whole. However, The Big Three rule diverges here, focusing only on the *biggest three* chunks because most complexity follows a power law distribution, where the first few causes account for the vast majority of the outcome, and subsequent causes contribute diminishing returns.

**Examples of The Big Three Rule Application:**

*   **Creating a YouTube Video:**
    *   **Big Three:** Packaging, Script, Topic.
    *   **Packaging (Big Three):** Thumbnail, Title, Hook.
    *   **Topic Choice (Big Three):** Timeliness, Importance, Relevance to Audience.
*   **Camera Presence (Behavior):** Eye contact, Clarity of speech, Hand gestures.
*   **Good Lifestyle:**
    *   **Big Three:** Health, Wealth, Relationships.
    *   **Health (Big Three):** Nutrition, Exercise, Recovery.
    *   **Wealth (Big Three):** Income, Investment, Spending.
    *   **Relationships (Big Three):** Friends, Family, Female Attraction.
*   **Nutrition (Big Three):** What to eat, How much to eat, When to eat.
*   **Exercise (Big Three):** Consistency, Progressive Overload, Injury Prevention.
*   **Income (for a business owner):** Marketing, Sales, Delivery.
*   **Consistency (for a habit):** Accountability, Identity, Reward.
*   **Driving a Car Safely:** Control, Attention, Speed.
*   **Looking Good in Clothes:** Fit, Quality, Congruence (style congruent with persona).

**Recursion Depth:** The rule should be applied recursively until actionable steps are reached. For example, "consistency" itself is broken down further into accountability, identity, and reward, which are actionable.

**Historical Analogy:**
Julius Caesar's strategy during the Siege of Alesia is used as an analogy for the "divide and conquer" principle embodied by The Big Three rule. Faced with a double encirclement (besieging Gauls while being besieged by a larger Gallic army), Caesar focused on three non-negotiable priorities: fortifications, supplies (logistics), and troop morale. This focus on the "big three" allowed him to overcome overwhelming odds.

The summary encourages the audience to apply The Big Three rule to problems in their own lives and share their analyses in the comments section, offering "homework" and examples to illustrate its broad applicability. The concluding message reinforces the importance of acting on one's dreams: "if you do not sacrifice for your dreams, your dreams become the sacrifice."
