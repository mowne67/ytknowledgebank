The esoteric health movement originated during the pandemic, stemming from a perceived lack of accountability from vaccine companies, which were seen as profiting significantly and being immune to lawsuits for vaccine injuries. An anecdotal observation involved a doctor noting an increase in "frozen shoulder" injuries, consistently occurring on the arm where patients reported receiving their COVID-19 shots.

Further contributing to this movement's rise was the response to higher COVID-19 complication rates in the Black community. While investigations reportedly linked these complications to higher rates of obesity, the public narrative, as perceived, emphasized "systemic racism" rather than promoting public health measures to combat obesity. This was seen as a missed opportunity to encourage a healthier society, with focus instead placed on pharmaceutical interventions. This perceived betrayal led individuals to seek alternative health guidance, forming a grassroots movement.

Early proponents of this movement advocated for practices such as filtering estrogens from water, using tallow for skincare, employing reverse osmosis or carbon filters for fluoride in water, and consuming saturated fats like butter and eggs, contrary to some conventional medical advice.

The core tenets of the esoteric health movement are:
1.  Skepticism towards authorities.
2.  Embracing traditional and time-tested health methods.
3.  Prioritizing self-experimentation to understand personal health.

This period is described as a "decade of divergence," marked by perceived political and cultural shifts. Politically, substances like Red 40, seed oils in baby formula, and fluoride in water are reportedly under investigation for potential bans or removal. Culturally, there is a growing awareness of dietary components like seed oils, even among younger demographics, and some fast-food companies are reportedly transitioning from seed oils to tallow. The historical shift of McDonald's from tallow to seed oils, influenced by public perception, suggests a potential return to tallow if public sentiment shifts again. Additionally, mainstream retailers like Walmart are now stocking products such as fluoride-free toothpaste and non-toxic skincare items, indicating broader market acceptance of these previously niche products.

However, the movement also faces internal challenges. Concerns exist regarding "bad actors" who might use the movement for personal gain. An example provided is an individual who promoted an ancestral diet and physique while allegedly using undisclosed anabolic steroids, misleading followers about the source of their results. This concern extends to other influencers who may covertly use performance-enhancing substances.

The supplement industry is largely viewed as ineffective, with a high percentage of products deemed a waste of money. A competitive "esoteric arms race" is observed among influencers to promote expensive, unproven supplements (e.g., deer antler velvet, colostrum, pine pollen) that offer minimal gains and potentially unstudied side effects. The appeal of these supplements is attributed more to persuasive marketing than scientific validation.

Furthermore, some creators within the health space are seen as seeking "controversial" or "hot takes" to position themselves as offering cutting-edge health information. There are also warnings against "cult-like personalities" who attempt to establish comprehensive systems (e.g., a "Don't Die" movement encompassing religion, economics, politics, and ethics), with one individual openly stating competition with religious figures.

The fundamental principles of health, such as sleep, exercise, and diet, are emphasized as unchanging and more critical than supplements. The importance of not blindly trusting any authority, including health institutions and influencers, is stressed. Individuals are encouraged to develop a "filter" for information, learn philosophy, and detect "double speak"—language used to obscure meaning. It is suggested that arguments should be clear and understandable; if not, it indicates either laziness or an attempt to deceive. Self-verification and self-experimentation are presented as crucial for discerning truth.

A discussion of the "mouse utopia experiments" from the 1950s and 1970s is introduced, which studied the effects of overpopulation in an ideal environment. In these experiments, nine mice in an enclosure designed for 6,000 reached a peak population of only 2,000 before declining to extinction. This decline was attributed to "behavioral sink," where male mice exhibited feminized behaviors and hormonal states, while female mice became more aggressive. A notable phenomenon was the emergence of "beautiful ones"—young male mice who focused solely on grooming and self-beautification, isolating themselves and showing no interest in mating.

This "beautiful ones" phenomenon is paralleled with the human "looksmaxing" movement, which, while initially focused on attracting women, has evolved into prioritizing pure aesthetics, particularly with the "black pill" philosophy suggesting only looks matter. The evolution of looksmaxing is described from basic self-improvement to more extreme practices like "mewing" (now widely known) and potentially future practices like "bone smashing" and "height maxing" (surgical leg lengthening), which are criticized for sacrificing physical performance for appearance. This focus on appearance is linked to dating apps, where interactions are picture-based, leading men to optimize their visual presentation, becoming "ensnared by the female gaze." Historical parallels are drawn to the decline of the Roman Empire, suggesting a similar societal pattern. The extreme forms of looksmaxing are viewed as precursors to a societal "end" resulting from information and stimulation overload. The recommended solution is to reduce content consumption, select a limited number of trusted sources, and prioritize self-experimentation to find truth.
