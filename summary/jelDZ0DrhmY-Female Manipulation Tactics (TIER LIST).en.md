### **The Ranked Manipulation Tactics:**

*   **Crying (Private):**
    *   This is when a woman upsets a man, and when he expresses his feelings, she begins to cry.
    *   This shifts the focus onto her feelings, making the man feel like the antagonist.
    *   **Rank: F Tier**

*   **Crying (Socially):**
    *   This involves crying in a public setting or posting about it on social media.
    *   This tactic garners public sympathy for the woman and instantly makes the man appear to be the bad guy.
    *   A statistic is cited that in a domestic dispute, if a man calls the police but the woman is crying upon their arrival, the man is more likely to be arrested, even if he is the one with physical injuries.
    *   **Rank: C Tier**

*   **Lying:**
    *   Lying is described as a manipulation tactic that alters a person's perception of reality.
    *   It's stated that feminine women may not be intentional liars but rather speak based on their current feelings, which are subject to rapid change. This can be perceived as untrustworthy.
    *   **Rank: B Tier**

*   **Trickle Truths:**
    *   This is described as an advanced form of lying where a woman reveals only a small part of the truth.
    *   This is often done when she is close to being fully exposed, giving just enough information to be upsetting but not enough to cause a breakup.
    *   A personal anecdote is shared about a first girlfriend who, over several days, slowly revealed the extent of her past relationship with another manâ€”first claiming they just texted, then admitting to sending nudes, then to having sex once, and finally to having sex many times without protection.
    *   This process is described as being able to drive a man insane, as he feels a constant need to press for more of the truth.
    *   The recommended way to handle this is to leave the relationship at the first sign of disrespect, rather than trying to uncover all the details.
    *   **Rank: S Tier**

*   **Makeup and Filters:**
    *   This refers to using cosmetics, social media filters, and AI software to appear more attractive than in reality.
    *   The manipulation lies in causing a man to become more invested in a woman based on an enhanced appearance.
    *   It is considered a weak tactic because most men are aware of it, and overuse can be seen as unattractive.
    *   **Rank: F Tier** (Crowned the weakest tactic).

*   **The White Dress:**
    *   This is a term for a woman who presents herself as a "good girl" (e.g., claims she doesn't party, wants marriage) but whose actions do not align with this image.
    *   She may still engage in "hoe behavior" but considers herself high-quality in comparison to her friends.
    *   It is considered a powerful manipulation because men seeking a traditional woman may be deceived by her words.
    *   The advice is to trust gut instincts and observe her actions, and to leave without confrontation if her behavior doesn't match her words.
    *   **Rank: A Tier**

*   **"Court Me":**
    *   This tactic is attributed to women in their 30s who are described as bitter after years of casual relationships.
    *   They demand that new men "court" them (e.g., pay for dates, put in significant effort), a standard they did not require from previous partners.
    *   This is framed as manipulation because she is demanding a higher price for herself when her value has, by this logic, diminished due to age and sexual history.
    *   It is argued that men of all ages are naturally more attracted to women in their early 20s due to youth and purity, and that this is a normal, biological preference.
    *   **Rank: F-minus Tier** (Crowned the silliest tactic).

*   **"You're Controlling":**
    *   This phrase is allegedly used against a man when he establishes boundaries, such as not wanting his partner to go to nightclubs or post revealing photos.
    *   This is framed as a manipulation tactic to make the man doubt his own reasonable standards.
    *   The advice given is not to try and change a woman, but to find a woman who already aligns with one's values. If you have to set these boundaries, she is not the right person.
    *   **Rank: C Tier**

*   **"He's Just a Friend":**
    *   This is a common defense when a woman is caught texting other men.
    *   It is argued that this is manipulation because nearly all male "friends" would have sex with her given the opportunity, and women who cheat often do so with a man they are already in communication with.
    *   Having male friends is presented as inherently disrespectful in a relationship.
    *   The advice is to have standards and end the relationship immediately if a woman is texting other men.
    *   **Rank: E Tier**

*   **False Rape Accusation:**
    *   This is presented as the most extreme and life-ruining form of manipulation.
    *   It is claimed that women may make false accusations for attention, money, revenge, or to cover up their own actions (like cheating).
    *   The story of Emmett Till is used as an example.
    *   It is stated that society often presumes the man is guilty, and his life can be ruined even if he is proven innocent.
    *   The advice is to always keep evidence of consensual encounters, such as screenshots of text messages or voice recordings, to protect oneself.
    *   **Rank: S+ Tier** (Crowned the most severe tactic).
