Jeffrey's finally got a girlfriend.
Oh.
Oh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.
Jeffrey, she's texting other guys.
You've got to confront her about this, man.
You've got to go speak to her about it.
Oh no.
Jessica's using one of the 10 manipulation tactics.
Don't fall for it, Jeffrey.
Don't fall.
No. It's too late.
He believed her.
And now she's getting pounded by one of the guys she was texting,
but she told him that he's just a friend.
Jeffrey, don't fall for these tactics.
Jeffrey, didn't you know that a lot of girls these days are using these?
Adonis.
Adonis does not fall for a puny female's manipulation tactics.
Now, he knows that there are good women out there.
One by one, Adonis deflected all of the manipulation tactics so that he could find a good woman.
This is how men need to live today.
What are the best and worst manipulation tactics that women use today?
In this video, I'm going to rank 10 of the most popular, most common manipulation tactics that women are using in modern dating.
I'll be ranking them from S tier all the way down to F tier.
And inside of this video, I'm going to crown one of these manipulation tactics as the best one, S plus.
And I'm also going to crown one of these as the worst, most silly.
Like, if you fall for this, you're just an idiot.
F-minus tier.
Let's start with the first manipulation tactic. Crying.
This has been a manipulation tactic that women have used for literally the existence of human beings.
And this is how it goes.
She does something to upset you. You are upset.
Since you're upset, she's upset and now it's about her.
She literally will hurt you.
Let's say, you know, she's texting guys and you see it.
You're upset.
Then she'll cry saying, "Oh, but I've upset you and now it's about her again and now you're the asshole."
So, of course, where do you think we're going to put crying in the rank of the manipulation tiers?
We're going to put it down low. We'll give it an F tier.
But here's where it gets interesting.
For the second manipulation tactic, I'm going to change it slightly.
How about crying socially?
So, not just crying between you and her in private,
but let's say she starts crying in public, or let's say she starts crying and then posting about it on social media.
Suddenly, that harmless act that you could kind of look at as like the act of a little girl who's trying to make you feel bad,
suddenly she's now getting basically everyone on her side.
If you're with a girl and she starts crying about something, okay, it's pretty normal, fine.
But if she cries and then posts about it on social media,
she's going to get so much extra support on her side because you as the man will instantly look like the bad guy.
The same in public as well.
Look, if you guys are out in public and let's say she's done something to upset you,
but then she cries in public, you look like the [ __ ].
So, I'm going to put crying socially higher on the list. I'm going to put it in the C tier.
And I want to teach you quickly how can you overcome this form of manipulation.
Don't take a woman's tears that seriously.
There's a phrase which is called crocodile tears,
which basically means when a woman's crying, but she's literally using it as a form of manipulation to make you feel bad or to get people onto her side.
There's an Instagram reel, I think, maybe hopefully we can find it for you,
where this girl, she's like crying on the phone to her partner, you know, she's like arguing with him or whatever,
and her friends are like sat in bed recording her.
She's on like the loudspeaker speaking to him, you know, "I can't believe you you you've hurt me like this."
And when she realizes her friends are recording, she turns to her friend who's recording and goes like this.
Like, you know, like she's like laughing happy and then goes back to pretending that she's crying again.
And her friends are like laughing because they know that that's her personality.
And a lot of girls are like this.
They literally will show you what seems like pure genuine tears, but they don't actually feel that bad.
They're doing it to make you feel bad.
The way you overcome this form of manipulation is to not take her tears seriously.
Women cry for like everything these days, bro.
A girl will cry because she's kind of stressed.
She'll cry because she's kind of hungry.
So then, if she cries because of some [ __ ] that's happened in your relationship, it doesn't mean that you should actually take it more seriously.
You should not allow that to change your perspective of anything that's happened in your relationship.
And another thing, as a society worldwide, we need to do this.
If you see a woman crying about her man, be aware that it could be a form of manipulation.
There's a statistic that literally blows my mind. You know what it is?
Let's say you're in a relationship with your girl. You're both at home.
If she attacks you, like I'm talking, she literally physically grabs you, scratches you, attacks you, and you call the police.
When the police arrive, if she has tears on her face, you are more likely to get arrested.
Even if you've got blood on you, her tears are more believable than your blood.
That's a real statistic.
If you are a victim of domestic abuse, you are more likely to get arrested yourself if she is crying.
Think about that for a second.
If you call the police, you call them, you they literally heard your voice, they asked your name,
you call the police saying, "Oh my god, my girlfriend's going crazy. She's just attacking me. She's grabbed a knife."
They'll come over. Statistically, you are more likely to get arrested than she is as long as she's crying.
Think about how crazy that is.
Cuz when the police come, they're [ __ ] idiots, right? Of course, bro.
The world is sexist, not to women, but to men.
When they come and see the little girl who's crying, they'll see you, the big aggressor, and blame it on you.
This is why us talking about manipulation is so important.
And I know this seems like a goofy video, but you're seeing my point now of like this video is actually quite purposeful for us to speak about, isn't it?
Let's talk about the third manipulation tactic that women are using, and it is lying.
Lying is manipulation because a woman will make you believe that reality is different from what it is.
You don't get the human right of being able to feel and base your decisions on reality just because she's maybe a bit embarrassed about something that she's done.
And the reason why lying is such a powerful manipulation tactic, especially when women do it, is because most men do not know just how much a woman would lie.
If you've ever been in the situation where you've had a girl compulsively lie to you,
you might have like had your perception of the world destroyed, thinking, "I cannot believe a girl who loves me could lie that much to me."
As men, our word is kind of like our bond. It's our our honor. We say what we mean.
For girls, especially feminine girls, it's not so much.
And so because of that, I'm going to put lying pretty high up. I'm going to put it in the B tier.
I'm not putting it all the way to the top.
The reason why is because feminine women are not exactly liars.
They're talking about what they feel like in the moment.
The problem is most men don't really relate to that at all.
And so when she tells you, "No, that guy I was texting, no, nothing's happening. I'm not interested in him."
The reason why she's saying that, even though it's technically not true, cuz she was interested enough to reply to him,
is because right here, right now, when you're in front of her, you're giving her attention, you're confronting her,
she doesn't feel like she's interested in another guy.
She can say, "I love you." And she means it,
but 10, 20 minutes from then when some guy from her past texts her,
her emotions can change just like the wind.
And she can go from loving you and just be only thinking about you
to suddenly getting a huge surge of emotions when maybe some guy from her past texts her or, you know, you haven't replied to her for like an hour or something.
And so more and more guys are kind of understanding like a feminine woman is kind of like extremely chaotic and untrustworthy in some ways.
And this is just the nature of a feminine woman.
And it's a hard thing to deal with because you would expect whatever a girl says to you is what she actually means, but it's not.
It's what she feels right now, which is subject to change every 2 minutes.
So, we've got lying for the B-tier.
But now, there is a different form of lying, which is way higher on the tiers of manipulation,
and it is something called trickle truths.
Trickle truths is like lying, but on steroids.
And this is how it works.
She'll tell you a part of the truth.
Like she'll tell you something which is in the direction of the truth,
but just enough to upset you, but not enough to really piss you off and make you end things with her.
She'll tell you that because you're close to finding out the full truth.
And hopefully she makes you believe the situation wasn't as bad as it actually was.
And you can imagine the number one scenario in which a woman will tell you trickle truths
is when she tells you how far she went with another guy that she was cheating on you with.
I remember last year I had a girl come over to my place. I had seen her a few times
and she told me that she had been married before, you know, at this point.
And it was quite interesting cuz she was still fairly young. She was like 28 years old.
And so I asked her, "Oh, that's crazy. You were married. Like, you know, what happened?"
And she said, "Yeah, he wanted a divorce when he found out that I cheated on him."
And I was like, "Oh, that's crazy. What did you do?"
And she says, "I kissed another guy."
And I instantly because I knew about Trickle Truth, I said to her, "Listen, it's me. You can tell me the truth."
You know, I was playing like the sort of like cool guy. I said, "You can tell me the truth. You didn't just kiss that guy, did you?"
And I swear to God, this is what she did. And she looked like she went, "No, I [ __ ] him as well."
Her husband, bless him, had the balls that when she told him that she just kissed this other guy, he still wanted to get divorced.
But a lot of women will literally go all the way like they'll cheat.
They'll get pounded maybe even multiple times, but they'll tell their man it was just a kiss.
"Oh no, no, nothing happened. We just went on a date but nothing happened."
They'll tell you something like, "Oh yeah, he just kissed me."
Instead of saying, "Yeah, he [ __ ] me three times in the night."
Because they want you to just be able to get kind of pissed off, but not enough that you actually kind of, you know, sus everything out.
My first girlfriend did this to me as well. I still remember this. This is probably what made me jaded for [ __ ] years.
I went to surprise her one day and I went over to her accommodation, like you know we were students in university.
And I even got inside of her flat like one of her flat mates opened the door for me.
And I knocked on her bedroom door and when she opened she was like shocked to see me.
And I literally I just knew for a fact there was like someone hiding underneath the bed or someone was here cuz I could tell she was just like guilty.
So I'm subtly, you know, cuz I don't want to show all my cards. I was like subtly kind of like checking if there's any [ __ ] guys here but there wasn't.
But my gut feeling was just there though, like she could not be trusted.
You know, your gut evolutionary like animal instinct was just telling you like some bullshit's happening.
Eventually, I noticed that she was on her phone and she had been texting a guy and I asked her like, "Who's that?"
And she said, "Oh, nothing. It's just like a guy from back home. He was just asking me how university was because she had just moved here."
And I knew that she was kind of lying about something.
So, I asked her, "Have you had sex with this guy before?"
And she said, "No. What? No, not at all. No, it's just a friend. He's just asking how this university was. There's nothing, you know, we're just texting. That's it. No, nothing at all."
My gut instinct didn't change. I kept on pressing her on it and said, "No, tell me the truth. Have you been with this guy? Like, have you kissed him before? Have you done anything with him? Tell me the truth."
She's like, "No, what happened? Come on, relax. You're just getting crazy. You're just, you know, you're being insecure now. You're just being angry about something, whatever."
She kept that up. I swear to God, this was for about an entire day.
I kept like, you know, it felt so awkward. I was sat there overthinking. She was telling me to just calm down, whatever.
And I said to her, I just gave her the ultimatum. I was like, "Listen, I know you're lying to me. If you lie one more time, I'm going to walk out the door. You will never see me again. Tell me the truth."
And she says, "Fine. Yeah, we used to send nudes to each other."
That already broke my heart. Cuz that's cheating, right?
If a girl used to send nudes to a guy, now she's texting him again whilst she's in a relationship with you, that's cheating.
So my heart was already broken. But the gut instinct didn't go.
So then I felt trapped, like I should have just walked away. I should have just ended the relationship.
But it's like I felt like this massive need to know all the details.
So I start speaking to her more. "Okay, when did that happen? Tell me. No, you didn't just send nudes. You've hooked up before. You've like kissed each other before minimum."
She's like, "No, no, no. Like we've never even done it. We literally just like, you know, just a
