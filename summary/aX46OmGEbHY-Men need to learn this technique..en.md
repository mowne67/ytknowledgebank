Here is a detailed summary of the content:

*   The correct method for cutting a pineapple involves first cutting off both the top and bottom ends.
*   The pineapple is then cut in half lengthwise.
*   To remove the core, two slices at right angles to each other should be used, rather than a single diagonal slice, to maximize the amount of edible fruit.
*   After the core is removed, the pineapple halves are further sliced into segments.
*   The outer skin, or "armor," is then removed from these segments.
*   To select a good pineapple, look for a nice golden, non-green outer surface.
*   Sugar leaking from the pineapple is an indicator of ripeness.
*   A good pineapple should have some compressibility when pressed, but not be overly soft.
*   A ripe pineapple should have a distinct pineapple smell; if it lacks this scent, it is not ripe enough.
*   The prickly sensation sometimes experienced when eating pineapple is caused by a digestive enzyme present in the fruit.
*   Fresh, ripe pineapples typically do not cause this prickly sensation.
*   Fresh pineapples are primarily available in specific regions, such as Latin America and Hawaii.
*   A ripe, fresh pineapple has a soft texture, similar to a mango, where teeth easily sink into it, unlike the segmented or crunchy texture of canned or unripe pineapples.
*   Royal Hawaiian pineapples from Dole plantations are highlighted as a particularly desirable type of fresh pineapple.
