Pornography is stated to cause a temporary 10% increase in testosterone; however, this boost is quickly nullified by a subsequent spike in prolactin. Prolactin is identified as the hormone responsible for "postnut clarity," released after ejaculation to suppress sex drive. Its function is described as designed to diminish ambition, energy, and momentum, leading to feelings of emptiness.

This hormone serves a dual purpose: when with a spouse or long-term partner, it facilitates pair bonding, allowing the partner's presence to alleviate the feeling of emptiness. Conversely, if the sexual act is with a casual acquaintance or, worse, virtual images, the emptiness remains unfulfilled and can become consuming.

It is asserted that prolactin, not estrogen, is the true opposite of testosterone. While testosterone makes effort and risk-taking feel rewarding, prolactin makes them feel painful. An unattached spike in prolactin can trigger a cascade of negative emotions and depress the hormonal system.

To manage prolactin levels, a zero-tolerance policy on pornography is advised. Instead of porn, individuals are encouraged to use their imagination for sexual release. For those in a committed relationship, consciously limiting sexual encounters to two to three times per week is suggested to create scarcity and enhance the sexual experience for both partners. Complete abstinence may lead to nocturnal emissions, which are described as normal and a natural way for the body to manage sexual energy, occurring monthly or more frequently.

Minimizing prolactin is generally recommended, with a key exception: impending fatherhood. In this specific scenario, prolactin is presented as beneficial, overriding testosterone and promoting peaceful hormones like serotonin and oxytocin. Prolactin is said to reduce dopamine and testosterone, preventing a man from seeking new partners, a behavior deemed inappropriate for a new father. It also reportedly upregulates serotonin, fostering a relaxed and blissful state often observed in new parents.

A scientific hypothesis proposes that humans can subconsciously detect if someone engages in pornography or meaningless sex, possibly through pheromones. An experiment involving women identifying their partners' t-shirts by smell, even after the scent molecules were washed away, is cited as evidence of subconscious mate detection. Chemical signaling in nature, such as the accelerated puberty of young females in the presence of sexually mature males or spontaneous miscarriages in pregnant females near novel males, further supports this hypothesis.

The hypothesis suggests that a hormonal profile characterized by high prolactin, low dopamine, low testosterone, and high cortisol signals to females that a male is already pair-bonded or preparing for fatherhood, thereby reducing his attractiveness as a potential mate. Thus, frequent consumption of pornography or masturbation is presented as signaling to surrounding females that one is unreceptive, projecting the image of a stressed, pair-bonded father rather than a male actively seeking a mate. Therefore, to attract a real-life partner, rejecting virtual ones is deemed necessary.
