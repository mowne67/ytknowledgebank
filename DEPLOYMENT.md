# YouTube Knowledge Bank - Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Extension New Tab Override Issue
- **Problem**: Extension was overriding the new tab page with loading.html
- **Solution**: Removed `chrome_url_overrides` from manifest.json
- **Result**: New tab page is no longer affected by the extension

### 2. Render Sign-in Error (BOT DETECTION) - FIXED ✅
- **Problem**: YouTube detecting requests as bot and requiring authentication
- **Solution**: Implemented environment-aware yt-dlp with optimized bot avoidance
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects deployment vs local environments
  - **Smart Cookie Handling**: Skips cookie-based approaches on deployment (no browser cookies available)
  - **Optimized User Agents**: Uses mobile and desktop user agents that work better on servers
  - **Enhanced Headers**: Multiple approaches to avoid bot detection
  - **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and retry mechanisms

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Extension Configuration
1. Open `extension_1/config.js`
2. Replace `'https://your-render-app-name.onrender.com'` with your actual Render URL
3. Reload the extension in Chrome

### 2. Render Deployment
1. Ensure your Render app has the following environment variables:
   ```
   PYTHON_VERSION=3.9
   ```
2. The app will automatically install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Render will use the `main.py` file as the entry point

### 3. Testing the Fixes
1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
2. **Extension Testing**:
   - Load the extension in Chrome
   - Navigate to a YouTube video
   - Click the extension icon
   - Verify it works with both local and production URLs

### 4. Authentication Fallback System (SIMPLIFIED)

The system now uses intelligent environment detection with optimized yt-dlp approaches:

#### **Deployment Environment (Render/Heroku/Railway)**
1. **Primary**: Mobile user agent (often works better on servers)
2. **Secondary**: Desktop user agent with enhanced headers
3. **Tertiary**: Simple user agent
4. **Final**: Basic approach with Googlebot user agent

#### **Local Development Environment**
1. **Primary**: yt-dlp with browser cookies (Chrome/Firefox)
2. **Secondary**: Enhanced yt-dlp headers
3. **Tertiary**: Mobile user agent
4. **Final**: Basic approach

### 5. Environment Detection

The system automatically detects the environment:
- **Deployment**: Detects `RENDER`, `HEROKU`, `RAILWAY` env vars or `/opt/render` in path
- **Local**: Uses cookie-based approaches first
- **Smart Fallback**: Skips cookie methods on deployment (no browser cookies available)

### 6. Troubleshooting Render Issues

If you still get sign-in errors on Render:

1. **Check Logs**: Monitor the Render logs for specific error messages
2. **Video Restrictions**: Some videos may require authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: YouTube may block requests from Render IPs
4. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Try different videos (some are more restrictive than others)
   - Consider using a different video hosting platform
   - Implement proxy rotation for Render

### 7. Extension Features

- **New Tab Override**: Disabled by default (can be enabled in config.js)
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically switches between local and production URLs
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and logging
- **Debug Mode**: Enable/disable debug logging in config.js

## Configuration Options

### Extension Configuration (`extension_1/config.js`)
```javascript
FEATURES: {
  overrideNewTab: false, // Set to true to override new tab
  enableDebugLogging: true // Enable/disable debug logs
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Welcome message
- `POST /summarize` - Main summarization endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check for monitoring

## Dependencies

- `yt-dlp` - For YouTube video processing
- `fastapi` - Web framework
- `loguru` - Logging
- Other dependencies for AI summarization

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"could not find chrome cookies database" error**: 
   - ✅ **FIXED**: System now detects deployment environment and skips cookie approaches
   - Will automatically use optimized user agent approaches instead

2. **"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" error**: 
   - ✅ **FIXED**: Multiple user agent approaches should handle this
   - Mobile user agents often work better on servers

3. **"Authentication required" error**: 
   - Video is restricted, try a different video
   - The fallback system should handle this automatically

4. **"Video not found" error**: 
   - Check if the video URL is valid
   - Video might be private or deleted

5. **Extension not working**: 
   - Check the API URL in config.js
   - Verify the Render deployment is working

6. **New tab still affected**: 
   - Make sure you reloaded the extension after changes

## Performance Notes

- **Deployment**: Uses optimized user agent approaches (mobile first, then desktop)
- **Local**: Tries cookie-based approaches first, then falls back to user agents
- **Multiple attempts**: System tries different approaches automatically
- **Failed attempts**: Logged for debugging with clear error messages

## Expected Behavior

When you deploy to Render, you should see:
```
Detected deployment environment, using optimized approach...
Trying yt-dlp approach 1/3...
Successfully extracted info for: [video title]
Subtitles downloaded successfully using yt-dlp approach 1
```

Instead of the previous cookie database errors!
